## Description
This [[Wand|wand]] has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the **[[Fireball|fireball]]** spell (save [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 3rd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.

The [[Wand|wand]] regains `dice: 1d6+1` (1d6+1) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wandâ€™s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
