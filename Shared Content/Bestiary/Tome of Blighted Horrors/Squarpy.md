### Squarpy
![[phpdkvhp.ltn.png|Squarpy|300]]
[[phpdkvhp.ltn.png|open outside]]

## Special Traits
**Captivating Song:** The beaked tentacles of the squarpy all sing the song of kelpies as a bonus action. However, the combination of eight such voices and the strange way that the sound travels through the water causes the captivating harmony to become even more haunting and strange. All creatures within 300 feet of the squarpy (underwater or out of the water) must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the squarpy. While charmed this way, the creature is also incapacitated, and it moves toward the squarpy using the most direct means available. The charm lasts for as long as the squarpy maintains the song (it can be lost as concentration) or until it’s broken with dispel magic or comparable magic. A charmed creature repeats the saving throw when it takes damage or when it begins suffocating, ending the effect on itself with a success.

**Constrict:** Grappled creatures take `dice: 2d8` bludgeoning damage plus `dice: 1d6` piercing damage at the start of the squarpy’s turn.

**Ink Cloud (recharge 6):** As a reaction to being attacked, the squarpy emit a cloud of ink around itself while underwater. The ink extends 20 feet beyond the squarpy’s space, and its area is heavily obscured. The ink persists for 1 minute and is stationary; it doesn’t move with the squarpy.

**Jet:** When the squarpy dashes, it jets in a straight line up to 180 feet.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The squarpy bites once and attacks twice with its tentacles.

**Melee Attack—Bite:** +9 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 3d6 + 5` piercing damage.

**Ranged Attack—Tentacle:** +9 to hit (reach 15 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 3d8 + 5` bludgeoning damage, and the target must make a successful DC 17 Dex saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 15). The squarpy can grapple up to eight creatures at one time. Maintaining grapples doesn’t interfere with the squarpy’s bite or tentacle attacks.

## Description
**Environment**: Sea (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary

Perhaps the most infamous creation of the physician Simon Sessile, this great beast is kept in the great aquarium at the Capitol, where its huge water tank enclosure is encased in thick, iron-reinforced, soundproof glass. The only access is through a second room on the floor above, which is simply a small metal cage with tightly spaced bars in which food-carcasses can be loaded and then dropped into the tank by pulling a lever to release the bottom of the cage. Nevertheless, despite all of these precautions, it seems that an aquarium keeper or night watchman disappears in the vicinity of the aquarium at least once a year. Sometimes some remnant of the missing person’s clothing is spotted resting at the bottom of the great tank, but usually there is no evidence of their fate other than, perhaps, a faint red haziness in the water the next morning. How the squarpy is able to lure these individuals into its sealed tank is unknown, but few doubt that it is doing just that.
