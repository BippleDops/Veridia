## Special Traits
**Animate Trees:** An algoid can innately cast the animate objects spell at will, requiring no components. Each casting animates two trees, which are all the algoid can control at a time. A newly animated tree takes one full round to uproot itself. Once free, trees act on the algoid's turn.

**Vulnerability to Water Magic:** Control water and destroy water spells deal `dice: 3d6` piercing damage to an algoid (no save).

**Water Camouflage:** An algoid has tactical advantage on Stealth checks when it has any type of standing water to blend into.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The algoid slams twice or attacks once with its mind blast.

**Melee Attack—Slam:** +6 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d8 + 4` bludgeoning damage. If an algoid scores a critical hit with this attack, the target must make a successful DC 14 Con saving throw or be stunned. The stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns; the condition ends on a successful save.

**Ranged Attack—Mind Blast:** automatic hit (range 60 ft. cone; creatures in the cone). Hit: creatures in the cone must make a successful DC 13 Int saving throw or be stunned for `dice: 3d4` rounds.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate marshes

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, or cluster (3–6)

## Description
The algoid is a living colony of algae that has developed some semblance of intelligence and mobility. It is dark green and roughly humanoid in shape. Algoids make their lairs in marshes and swamps. They are often encountered with other marsh-dwelling sentient plants, but never with shambling mounds (algoids hate them and usually attack them on sight).

An algoid is 7 feet tall and weighs about 300 pounds. The “skin” of an algoid is coarse and rough with a leafy texture. In its natural surroundings, it is nearly invisible until it attacks. Algoids use this natural camouflage to gain tactical advantage on Stealth checks when prey is nearby. The algoid lies in wait, submerged in water or a bog, locating prey with tremorsense. When a potential victim passes nearby, the algoid springs to attack.
