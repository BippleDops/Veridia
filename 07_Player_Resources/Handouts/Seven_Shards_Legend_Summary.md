# The Seven Shards: Legend Summary
## Ancient Artifacts of Reality

In the time before time, when the realms were one, a great catastrophe shattered the Crown of Stars - the artifact that maintained balance between all realities. Seven fragments scattered across the dimensions, each carrying immense power and terrible responsibility.

### The Prophecy

*"When seven become one, the Crown shall rise,*
*Reality's truth beneath star-filled skies.*
*But beware the price of power's call,*
*For one wrong step brings the fall of all."*

### Scholars' Interpretations

**Optimistic View:** Reuniting the shards will restore the original Crown of Stars, bringing peace and prosperity to all realms.

**Pessimistic View:** The shards were separated for good reason - bringing them together could destroy all reality.

**Moderate View:** The shards can be safely reunited, but only by those pure of heart and wise in their use.

### Warning Signs of Shard Activity

- Reality distortions (time skips, space warping)
- Massive changes in pressure or wind patterns
- Memory gaps affecting large populations
- Unexplained transformations in living beings
- Communication breakdowns across regions
- Shadows moving independently of their sources
- Spontaneous portal openings

### Research Centers

- **Aquabyssos:** The Archive of Depths
- **Aethermoor:** The Crystal Observatory
- **Neutral:** The Convergence Research Station

### Rewards for Information

The Parliament of Echoes offers substantial rewards for verified information regarding shard locations or activities. Contact your local representative for details.

**WARNING:** Attempting to personally interact with any shard without proper authorization and protection is extremely dangerous and potentially fatal.
