## Description
We offer a magnificent variety of belts, from the hefty leather weapon belts (with an optional baldric, for those quivers and short swords that we all prefer to keep handy, 7 sp), down to finely crafted gold-braid waist belts for those of elegant [[Dress|dress]] (25 gp). Our most common style of belt is either the canvas belt (2 sp), or leather (3 sp). In either of these styles we offer a special option; secret pouches between layers, where special documents or high end coinage can be safely and secretly stored. Access is from the inside surface of the belt, 2 sp above base cost. Widen your leather belt, and you now have enough room in your secret pouch for a very thin blade.

Auroraâ€™s also offers money belts, for merchants who dislike walking about with large sums of cash visible. We provide special sound-dampening fabric as an inner lining on these to dampen the jingle of your coin from being discerned by prying ears. We also offer some other unusual belts, such as the tool belt, with many built-in pouches and tool loops for the handyman (5 gp), and harvesting belts (3 sp), with hooks for attaching vegetable sacks. Please specify waist size when ordering; anything in silk is triple normal cost.
