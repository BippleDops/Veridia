--- # Timeline Tracker Base *"Time flows like current - track its passage or be swept away."* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Timeline Tracker Base provides the foundational framework for maintaining chronological consistency across the complex inter-realm campaign. This system tracks parallel time streams, dimensional synchronization, and the temporal effects of magical phenomena that can alter the flow of time differently in various locations. ### Duration

Ongoing campaign tool requiring constant maintece. ## Adventure Hooks

1. **Time Paradox**: Characters must resolve temporal inconsistency
2. **Timeline Investigation**: Research historical events with contradictory records
3. **Temporal Anchor**: Establish fixed points to prevent timeline drift ## Campaign Use

Essential tool for managing complex narrative threads and temporal elements in multi-realm adventures. ## Player-Facing Summary Timeline Tracker.base is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Timeline Tracker.base as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Timeline Tracker.base. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The First Prophecy of Winds ## Related Notes - [[Similar Topic 1
