--- # Censer of Controlling Air Elementals

*Wondrous item, rare* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/censer-of-controlling-air-elementals.webp#right) While gently swinging this censer, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic action to summon an [elemental]]. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the censer as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your [[Initiative Xphb count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a [Action Xphb]]. The censer can't be used this way again until the next dawn. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 243.
