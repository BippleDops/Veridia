*3rd-level, Necromancy (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of graveyard dirt)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

The target also has [[boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats)]] to all damage except Psychic damage, and it has [[immunity-xphb (variant-rules)]] to the [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition.
