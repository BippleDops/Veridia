Legends speak of The Void Touched Oracle as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Void Touched Oracle.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties The Void Touched Oracle to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
