# Quest - The Convergence Crisis
*When Two Worlds Collide*

## Overview
A catastrophic experiment by [[The Convergence Seekers]] has begun forcibly merging sections of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], creating unstable hybrid zones where the laws of both realms clash violently. The party must navigate between dimensions, work with factions from both worlds, and ultimately decide whether to complete the convergence, reverse it, or find a third option that preserves both realms' integrity.

## Background
### The Experiment
- [[The Convergence Seekers]] attempted to create a "test convergence" in a small area
- Used combination of [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards|Crystal Shard]] energy and [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]] shadow resonance
- The reaction proved far more powerful than anticipated
- Convergence zones are spreading, threatening both worlds with chaotic merger
- Reality itself is becoming unstable in affected areas

### The Crisis Escalates
- Merged zones exhibit properties of both realms simultaneously
- Citizens from both worlds are trapped in hybrid reality they can't survive
- Time distortions are creating temporal loops and paradoxes
- Both the Seven Shards and Deep Mother are responding to the disruption
- [[The Void Watchers]] warn that uncontrolled convergence could unmake both realities
