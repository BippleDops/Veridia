--- # Boon of Planar Travel When you gain this boon, choose a plane of existence other than the Material Plane. You can now use an action to cast the [[plane-shift-xphb (spells)]] spell (no spell slot or components required), targeting yourself only, and travel to the chosen plane, or from that plane back to the Material Plane. Once you use this boon, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 232* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Boon of planar travel is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
