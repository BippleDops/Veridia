# Aethermoor-Aquabyssos World Connection Guide
## The Convergence of Surface and Depth

> *"Two worlds, divided by catastrophe, united by necessity."*

## üåê Dimensional Architecture

### The Three States of Reality

#### State 1: Complete Separation (Historical)
- **Timeline**: 300 years ago to present
- **Barrier**: The Surface Seal - magical membrane preventing interaction
- **Aethermoor**: Develops crystal magic, faction conflicts
- **Aquabyssos**: Evolves underwater civilization, depth adaptations
- **Connection Points**: None (sealed)

#### State 2: Partial Merger (Current Campaign)
- **Timeline**: Post-Crystal Festival events
- **Barrier**: Weakening, selective breaches
- **Merged Zones**: 
  - [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]] ‚Üî [[Abyssos Prime Upper Districts]]
  - [[Lighthouse of Storms]] ‚Üî [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Inverse Palace]]
  - [[Crystal Gardens]] ‚Üî [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Screaming Gardens]]
- **Mechanics**: Reality shifts every 12 hours

#### State 3: Full Convergence (Possible Future)
- **Timeline**: After Deep Mother resolution
- **Barrier**: Completely dissolved
- **New Geography**:
  - Floating Aquabyssos districts above Aethermoor cities
  - Inverted waterfalls connecting realms
  - Shared atmospheric zones (air/water hybrid)
- **Population**: Integrated society with adaptation variations

## üîÑ Continental Connections

### Parallel Structures
Each Aquabyssos continent has an Aethermoor counterpart:
