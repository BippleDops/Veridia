# Biting Shadow (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 90 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You create a smoky cloud whose area consists of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. When casting this spell, and as a bonus action on each of your turns after-wards, you may move the cloud 30 feet. It is capable of moving through a crack 1 inch wide without squeezing. This cloud is lined with dark mouths which are filled with gleaming black teeth. Each living or undead creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d6 piercing damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.
