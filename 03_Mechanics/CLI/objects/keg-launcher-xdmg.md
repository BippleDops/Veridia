# Keg Launcher
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 96*  

A back-mounted, wooden catapult flings small kegs of toxic gas. Loading a Keg Launcher requires the [Utilize](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Utilize) action, and aiming it requires another [Utilize](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Utilize) action. Then a crew member can take the Toxic Keg action.
