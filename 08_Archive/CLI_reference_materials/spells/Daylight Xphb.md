# Daylight
*3rd-level, Evocation*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/daylight.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration, sunlight spreads from a point within range and fills a 60-foot-radius [Sphere](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md). The sunlight's area is [Bright Light](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) and sheds [Dim Light](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 60 feet.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the sunlight to fill a 60-foot [Emanation](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the sunlight.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of [Darkness](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) created by a spell of level 3 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.

**Classes**: [Druid](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Warlock (Celestial Patron)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-celestial-patron-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Cleric (Light Domain)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-light-domain-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Cleric](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Ranger](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md); [Paladin](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md); [Sorcerer](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")

## Adventure Hooks

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
