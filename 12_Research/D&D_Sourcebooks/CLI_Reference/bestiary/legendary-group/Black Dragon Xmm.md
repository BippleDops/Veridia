# Black Dragon

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing an adult or ancient black dragon's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Acrid Haze.** Odorous and stifling fog covers the area within 1 mile of the lair, rendering that area [[lightly-obscured-xphb|Lightly Obscured]]. Travel for creatures other than the dragon and its allies takes twice the usual time in that area.  
- **Foul Water.** Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. A creature that drinks such water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition for 1 hour.  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
