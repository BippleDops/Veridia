*Weapon ([[Greataxe Xphb), legendary (requires attunement by a dwarf, fighter, or paladin of good alignment)* - **Damage**: `dice: 1d12` slashing
- **Properties**: [item properties#Heavy|Heavy]], [[item-properties#Two-Handed|Two-Handed
- **Weight**: 7.0 lbs. A mighty axe wielded long ago by the dwarf king Torhild Flametongue, Orcsplitter is a battered weapon that appears unremarkable at first glance. Its head is graven with the Dwarvish runes for "orc," but the runes are depicted with a gap or slash through the markings; the word "orc" is literally split in two. You gain the following benefits while holding this magic weapon: - You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. - When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon against an [Bestiary]], that [[Bestiary must succeed on a **DC 17** Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points. - You can't be [conditions#Surprised|surprised]] by [[Bestiary while you're not [conditions#Incapacitated|incapacitated]]. You are also aware when [[Bestiary are within 120 feet of you and aren't behind total cover, although you don't know their location. - You and any of your friends within 30 feet of you can't be [conditions#frightened|frightened]] while you're not [[conditions#Incapacitated|incapacitated. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Sentience Orcsplitter is a sentient, lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 6, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 10. It can see and hear out to 120 feet and has [senses#Darkvision|darkvision]]. It communicates by transmitting emotions to its wielder, although on rare occasions it uses a limited form of telepathy to bring to the wielder's mind a couplet or stanza of ancient Dwarvish verse. ## Personality Orcsplitter is grim, taciturn, and inflexible. It knows little more than the desire to face [[Bestiary in battle and serve a courageous, just wielder. It disdains cowards and any form of duplicity, deception, or disloyalty. The weapon's purpose is to defend dwarves and to serve as a symbol of dwarven resolve. It hates the traditional foes of dwarvesâ€”giants, goblins, and, most of all, [Bestiary]]â€”and silently urges its possessor to meet such creatures in battle. *Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 224* ## Player-Facing Summary Orcsplitter pota is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of orcsplitter pota as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around orcsplitter pota. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[Master_Item_Catalog
