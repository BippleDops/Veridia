# The Emerald Sage Willowbark
*Guardian of the Heart Tree, Keeper of Natural Balance*

## Overview
Willowbark has been the guardian of the Heart Tree in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Verdant Reach]] for over three centuries, though few realize the tree itself contains the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards|Emerald Shard]]. Born from the union of a human druid and a dryad, she has slowly merged with both the tree and the Shard over the centuries, becoming something between mortal, nature spirit, and divine artifact. She speaks for the natural world and maintains the delicate balance that keeps the Emerald Shard from overwhelming the region with unchecked growth.

## Description
- **Appearance**: Ancient woman with bark-like skin and leaves growing from her hair
- **Eyes**: Deep green with golden flecks that shift like sunlight through forest canopy
- **Integration**: Parts of her body appear to be living wood, flowers bloom on her shoulders
- **Voice**: Rustles like wind through leaves, speaks slowly and deliberately
- **Presence**: Wildlife gathers peacefully around her, plants lean toward her

## Background
### The Long Communion

- Became Heart Tree guardian at age 20
- Discovered Emerald Shard embedded in tree's heart after 50 years
- Chose to merge gradually with both tree and Shard rather than remove either
- Process took centuries, maintains balance between human will and nature's chaos

### The Great Balance
- Prevents Emerald Shard from turning entire continent into overgrown jungle
- Channels Shard's power into sustainable natural growth
- Mediates between aggressive nature spirits and human settlements
- Maintains [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Verdant Reach]] as sanctuary for both
