## Special Traits
**Fiery Insides:** Whenever a giant ant exoskeleton takes slashing or piercing damage, flames from its insides erupt through the wound. Everyone within 5 feet of where the attack struck must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (`dice: 1d6`) fire damage.

## Description
Giant ant exoskeletons can be animated into undead creatures through rare necromantic magic. The process burns out whatever remained of their organic insides and replaces it with magical fire. They can be turned by turn undead.
