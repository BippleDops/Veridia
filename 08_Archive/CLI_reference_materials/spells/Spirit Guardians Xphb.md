# Spirit Guardians
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a prayer scroll)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Protective spirits flit around you in a 15-foot [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.

When you cast this spell, you can designate creatures to be unaffected by it. Any other creature's [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb|Speed]] is halved in the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]], and whenever the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] enters a creature's space and whenever a creature enters the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] or ends its turn there, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes `3d8` Radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or `3d8` Necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d8` for each spell slot level above 3.
