## Overview
Father Aquilus Deepprayer is the sole remaining priest of the Old Faith, a religious tradition that once dominated Aquabyssos before political changes led to its suppression. He maintains a hidden shrine in the deepest parts of the city, serving any who still remember the old ways.

Once part of a thriving religious hierarchy, he now stands alone as keeper of ancient rites, forbidden knowledge, and the spiritual needs of those who reject the new state-approved religion.

## Background
Father Aquilus served in the Great Temple when the Old Faith was still legal. Political pressure from the crown led to religious persecution, forcing most priests to convert, flee, or face imprisonment. He chose to remain, going underground to serve the faithful.

For fifteen years, he has maintained his calling in secret, performing marriages, funerals, and other rites for those who still believe.

## Hidden Shrine

## The Old Faith
**Core Beliefs**: Ancient water spirits, ancestor worship, natural harmony
**Practices**: Tidal ceremonies, depth meditation, sacred swimming
**Holidays**: Seasonal celebrations tied to ocean currents
**Scriptures**: Ancient texts written in pre-monarchical language

## Adventure Hooks

**Tragic Figure**: Represents loss of cultural heritage and religious freedom
**Mentor**: Can teach characters about faith, sacrifice, and standing for principles
