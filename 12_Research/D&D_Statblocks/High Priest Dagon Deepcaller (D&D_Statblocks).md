## Overview
High Priest Dagon Deepcaller is the supreme leader of [[The Leviathan Cult|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/The Leviathan Cult]], a horrifying hybrid of human and aboleth created through dark rituals and generations of selective breeding. He serves as the primary conduit between the sleeping Leviathan Lords and their mortal worshippers, using his telepathic abilities and divine magic to coordinate cult operations across the oceans. His ultimate goal is to awaken the primordial sea gods and return the world to an aquatic paradise.

### Driving Goals
1. **Primary**: Awaken all four Leviathan Lords simultaneously
2. **Secondary**: Convert surface populations to hybrid servants
3. **Personal**: Achieve perfect fusion of land and sea consciousness
4. **Ultimate**: Become avatar of the Leviathan Lords on mortal plane

### The Great Awakening Ritual
> [!warning] DM Only
> Dagon is preparing a massive ritual requiring simultaneous sacrifices at four locations to wake all Leviathan Lords. The ritual needs 1,000 sacrifices per location and must occur during the deepest ocean tides of the year.

### Forbidden Lore
> - Knows location of three of the Seven Shards
> - Has prophetic knowledge of coming "crystal convergence"
> - Understands connection between [[The Deep Mother|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Deep Mother]] and ancient civilizations
> - Possesses ritual to merge aboleth and human consciousness permanently

### Direct Confrontation
1. **The Prophet's Challenge**: Dagon offers single combat to prove cult's righteousness
2. **Siege of the Cathedral**: Assault on cult headquarters while Dagon is present
3. **The Conversion Offer**: Attempts to recruit party as elite hybrid warriors
4. **Divine Duel**: Magical contest between Dagon and party's divine caster

### Indirect Operations
5. **Stop the Ritual**: Prevent awakening ceremony at multiple locations
6. **The Double Agent**: Infiltrate cult while avoiding Dagon's telepathy
7. **Rescue Mission**: Save converted ally before transformation becomes permanent
8. **The Prophecy**: Use Dagon's visions to prevent greater catastrophe
