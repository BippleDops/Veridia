Showcase a griffin with muscular limbs within an environment that feels like a cross between the underwater world and the sky. Use a strict palette of teals, deep blues, and sea-greens with pearl highlights. The griffin should be amidst motion, with realistic aquatic features such as subsurface caustics and bioluminescent accents. Also included in the scene is a human silhouette providing scale. The scene should avoid any modern tech or signage, straying away from photographic realism, anime style, bloom glare, or sci-fi UIs. Ensure that the gear worn by the characters is not only grounded in medieval fantasy but also coherent with the culture of the world being portrayed.",
