# Thunderclap
You create a burst of thunderous sound that can be heard up to 100 feet away. Each creature within range, other than you, must make a Constitution saving throw or take `dice: 1d6|avg` (1d6) thunder damage.

The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (`dice: 2d6|avg` (2d6)), 11th level (`dice: 3d6|avg` (3d6)), and 17th level (`dice: 4d6|avg` (4d6)).
