# Armor of Vulnerability (Piercing)
*Cursed item, rare (requires attunement)*  


- **Properties**: [[item-properties#Cursed%20Items|Cursed]]

While wearing this armor, you have [[resistance-xphb|Resistance]] to Piercing damage.

## Curse

This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when the [[identify-xphb|Identify]] spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by a [[remove-curse-xphb|Remove Curse]] spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have [[vulnerability-xphb|Vulnerability]] to Bludgeoning and Slashing damage.
