# Second Chance

## Overview

Fortune favors you when someone tries to strike you. You gain the following benefits:

## Effects

- Increase your Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force that creature to reroll. Once you use this ability, you canâ€™t use it again until you roll initiative at the start of combat or until you finish a short or long rest.
