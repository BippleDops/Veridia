# Rusting Grasp (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (the antenna or a scale from a rust monster)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
You touch a ferrous metal or alloy and cause it to rust. This inflicts 4d10 acid dam-age each round to an inanimate object such as an iron wall. Magical metallic objects take half damage.

If you touch either metal armor or a metal shield, it takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to AC 10 or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed. If you touch a metal weapon, the weapon takes a permanent and cumula-tive -1 to the damage it deals. If the penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Touching metallic weapons and armor in combat requires you to make an attack using your spell attack modifier.

You may use this to attack a metallic creature, such as an iron golem or a gorgon. The creature may make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 4d10 acid damage on a failed roll, or half as much damage on a successful one.
