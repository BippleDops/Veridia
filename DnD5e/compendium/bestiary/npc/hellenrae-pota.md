## Description

The chief lieutenant of Marlos Urnrayle, Hellenrae lost her sight as a child. A bitter, angry orphan, she was taken in by a monastic order and trained to use her other senses to compensate. However, she took the monks' philosophy of self-denial and emptiness of mind to extremes, seeking to fill herself with the dark power she sensed sleeping in the earth and rock around her.

Hellenrae is a dour, unsmiling woman who habitually wears drab robes and a golden gargoyle mask with no eye holes. She despises weakness in any form. Therefore, she hates just about everybody, and barely tolerates the other Black Earth cultists.
