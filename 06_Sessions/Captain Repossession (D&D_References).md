--- > [!figure] Portrait ## 🔧 [[Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### [Connection Improvements]] - Add cross-references to related notes ### [[Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-[Facing Summary]] [[Captain Repossession is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## [Lore Details]] Legends speak of [[Captain Repossession as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around [Captain Repossession]]. ## DM [[Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## [Plot Hooks]] - The authorities needs help stealing before dawn
