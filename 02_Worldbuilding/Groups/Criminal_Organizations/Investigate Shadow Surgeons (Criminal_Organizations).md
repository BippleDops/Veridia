## Overview
The Investigate Shadow Surgeons (ISS) is a specialized medical organization dedicated to studying, treating, and ultimately preventing the growing epidemic of shadow-related health complications plaguing [[Aquabyssos]]. As shadow corruption spreads throughout the realm and [[The Shadow Conspiracy|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/The Shadow Conspiracy]] continues its replacement operations, the ISS has emerged as the foremost authority on shadow-inflicted medical conditions, developing treatments for everything from shadow poisoning to identity dissociation caused by shadow separation.
