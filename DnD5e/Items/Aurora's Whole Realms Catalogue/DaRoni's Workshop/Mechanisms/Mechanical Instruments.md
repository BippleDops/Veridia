## Description
The art of music is most strange and not convenient. Sculpture, painting, and architecture last when the artists hand leaves the substance, but music stops if the artists hand is stilled. So I ask myself how to make the timely music last, and I think of mechanical instruments. I put gears and levers and springs to make music and not fingers. This way a song stays when the bard leaves or the bard can play other instruments along with it.

Drum: This mechanical drum (40 gp) has four sticks on pivots that strike the head and return. A turning cylinder has gouges out of its round edge to trigger the stick. Has different cylinder for different music (8 gp each) and cylinder can be wound up on a spring to turn moderate in speed or turned by hand for fast or slow speed.

[[Violin]]: The catgut rolls over the strings when the crank turns, and the strings go up and down to make different notes with levers inside the soundbox. The [[Violin|violin]] (95 gp) has different master cranks (20 gp each) per song.

Yeomans Fiddle: A crank makes the wheel covered with rosin go around against the strings while a set of gears presses the keys. The yeomans fiddle (75 gp) can crank or have a spring wind it. It has different wheels for different folk songs (15 gp each).

## Additional Details
use of one of these instruments by a bard in a marketplace attracts much attention, bringing `dice: 3d4` gp, per hour of play; all mechanical instruments have a 10% chance of malfunction per turn
