# Catching Chain (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (three joined links of chain made from very pure metal)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You call forth a chain made of pure, shin-ing energy, target a creature you can see within range, and make a ranged spell at-tack. On a hit, the chain coils around that target. The target is not restrained by the chain, but has disadvantage on all attack and damage rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, and reduces speed by 10 feet.

The chain is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. The spell can be modified to have one of two dif-ferent effects.

♦ ***Howling Chain.*** The chain is blood-red and constantly emits an ominous, howl-ing chant. It beats against its trapped target, using your spell modifier to attack. On a hit, it deal 3d8 bludgeoning damage.

♦ ***Sighing Chain.*** The chain glows white-blue and constantly sighs, whispers, and hums. If the trapped creature attempts to pull at it, the chain tightens, inflicting 3d10 bludgeoning damage. If someone tries to pull at the chain or remove it from the trapped creature, it inflicts 2d10 bludgeoning damage to both creatures.
