Adding images is really easy! You can literally just Copy and Paste them into notes!

When you paste an image in, the note will be updated with some text that looks like this:

`![[GemmyDM.png]]`

It's just the name of the file wrapped in `[[square brackets]]`

Note that there is a `!` in front of the leading square brackets. The `!` tells the tool to render the image as a picture instead of just showing the link. 
The reverse of this is you can remove the `!` and it will just display a link to the image. 

![[GemmyDM.png]]

`![[GemmyDM.png|300]]`

[[GemmyDM.png]]

`[[GemmyDM.png]]`

You can also resize images. To do that you need to add a pipe `|` to the end of the image name and set the size. 

![[GemmyDM.png|150]]

`![[GemmyDM.png|150]]`

> [!warning] Where Do Images Get Stored?
> When you paste an image into your vault, a copy of that image is copied into your vault. Unlike tools like Microsoft Word where the image is stored inside the document; Obsidian places a copy of the actual file in your vault.

> This can get messy pretty quickly and the easiest way to maintain order is to `Right Click` on a folder and click `Select as Attachment Folder`. Any new images (or files) will be added straight to this folder moving forward. I like to create a folder titled `z_Attachments`. The `z_` is just to ensure the folder sorts to the very bottom of my folder list. Out of mind out of sight.
