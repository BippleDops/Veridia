### Enhancement Improvements

- Add 12_Research-specific enhancement

## Spellcasting Focus

You can use the hat as a [[spellcasting-focus-xphb (variant-rules)]] for your Wizard spells.

## Unknown Spell

As a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you can try to cast a cantrip that you don't know. The cantrip must be on the Wizard spell list and have a casting time of an action, and you make a DC 10 Intelligence ([[skills#Arcana|Arcana]]) check. On a successful check, you cast the spell. On a failed check, the spell fails, and the action used to cast the spell is wasted. In either case, you can't use this property again until you finish a [[long-rest-xphb]].
