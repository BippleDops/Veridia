## Overview

Suspended high above [[Crystalhaven on crystally-powered levitation platforms, Arcanum Heights represents the pinnacle of magical achievement in [Aethermoor]]. This district of floating towers, aerial bridges, and gravity-defying gardens serves as the premier magical research and education center for the surface world, rivaling even the infamous [[Abyssal Academy in the depths of [Aquabyssos]].

The Heights house the most advanced magical practitioners, dangerous experimental facilities, and the largest collection of pre-[[Great Drowning|The [[Great Drowning|[02_Worldbuilding|02 Worldbuilding]]/Lore/[[The Great Drowning]] magical knowledge remaining on the surface. Here, crystal-powered enchantments push the boundaries of what many consider possible, creating both wonders and catastrophes in equal measure.
