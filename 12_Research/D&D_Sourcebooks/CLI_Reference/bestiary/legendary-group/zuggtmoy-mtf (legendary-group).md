_Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_ On Initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Zuggtmoy can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row: - Zuggtmoy causes four [[Gas Spore Fungus Xmm]] or [[violet-fungus-xmm (plant)]] to appear in unoccupied spaces that she chooses within the lair. They vanish after 1 hour. - Up to four plant creatures that are friendly to Zuggtmoy and that Zuggtmoy can see can use their reactions to move up to their speed and make one weapon attack. - Zuggtmoy uses either her Infestation Spores or her Mind Control Spores, centered on a mushroom or other fungus within her lair, instead of on herself. ## Regional effects The region containing Zuggtmoy's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects: - Molds and fungi grow on surfaces within 6 miles of the lair, even where they would normally find no purchase. - Plant life within 1 mile of the lair becomes infested with parasitic fungi, slowly mutating as it is overwhelmed. - If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Zuggtmoy table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours. If Zuggtmoy dies, these effects fade over the course of`d10`days. ### Madness of Zuggtmoy If a creature goes mad in Zuggtmoy's lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for more on madness. **Madness of Zuggtmoy**`dice: [](zuggtmoy-mtf.md#^madness-of-zuggtmoy)`| dice: d100 | Flaw (lasts until cured) |

| 81â€“00 | "I am constantly scratching at unseen fungal infections." |

^madness-of-zuggtmoy ## Player-Facing Summary Zuggtmoy mtf is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of zuggtmoy mtf as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around zuggtmoy mtf. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
