# The Sunken Cathedral of Stars

## Overview
Once the greatest temple to the gods of the surface world, the Cathedral of Stars now exists in a massive air bubble preserved by failing divine magic. Located at 800 feet depth, the cathedral serves as headquarters for the [[Church of the Tidal Throne]] while simultaneously being a dungeon filled with divine trials, corrupted celestials, and theological mysteries. The building phases between air and water unpredictably, making exploration treacherous.

## Cathedral Levels

### The Drowned Narthex (Entry)
The grand entrance hall, half-flooded, where [[Prophet Nerida Voidgazer]] greets pilgrims and judges their worthiness. Massive doors bear warnings in ancient script about the trials within. [[Temple Guardian Marcus the Drowned]] stands eternal watch, neither living nor dead.

### The Nave of Echoes (Ground Floor)
The main worship hall where services are held when the water recedes. The ceiling shows constellations that no longer match the sky above water. [[Choir Master Celestine Hymnsinger]] leads the Drowned Choir in songs that can be heard for miles underwater.

### The Flooded Transepts (East/West Wings)
- **East**: Library of theological texts, managed by [[Brother Matthias Inkdrinker]], partially waterlogged
- **West**: Chambers of confession where [[Inquisitor Mordecai Truthseeker]] extracts secrets

### The Choir Depths (Upper Level)
Once the choir loft, now inverted and flooded. Home to [[The Singing Shadows]], former choir members transformed into aquatic undead who still sing hymns.

### The Bell Tower (Highest Point)
The tower stretches above the water into an air pocket. The bells ring on their own, warning of divine displeasure. [[Mad Bell-Ringer Thomas]] claims the bells speak prophecy.

### The Crypts Below (Basement)
Flooded tombs of pre-drowning clergy. [[Keeper of the Dead, Sister Morwyn]] tends to the waterlogged corpses that occasionally rise to defend the cathedral.

### The Star Chamber (Hidden Sanctuary)
Secret room where the cathedral's greatest treasure, the [[Constellation Codex]], is kept. Only accessible when specific stellar alignments occur.

## Divine Trials

### Trial of Breath
Chambers that rapidly flood and drain, testing faith and lung capacity. Survivors gain the blessing of water breathing for one day.

### Trial of Pressure
Rooms where divine pressure tests resolve. Those who don't break gain resistance to depth effects.

### Trial of Truth
Mirrors that show what the viewer truly is - many flee in horror. [[Inquisitor Mordecai Truthseeker]] uses these for interrogations.

### Trial of Faith
Leap into seemingly empty water that may or may not catch you. True believers are saved; doubters fall into the crypts.

## Notable Features

### The Weeping Altar
Main altar that constantly drips water that was once wine. The water has healing properties but causes religious visions.

### The Constellation Pool
Scrying pool showing the night sky as it was before the drowning. [[Astrologer Prime Cassandra Starweaver]] reads dire fortunes here.

### The Drowning Font
Baptismal font that transforms air-breathers into water-breathers permanently, but at a terrible cost to their sanity.

### The Reforming Murals
Wall paintings that change based on the water level, telling different stories of the drowning depending on perspective.
