*Weapon ([[Dart Xphb), uncommon* - **Damage**: `dice: 1d4` piercing
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [item properties#Finesse|Finesse]], [[item properties#Thrown|Thrown
- **Weight**: 0.25 lbs. This small dart is decorated with designs like windy spirals that span the length of its shaft. When you whisper the word "seek" and hurl this dart, it seeks out a target of your choice within 120 feet of you. You must have seen the target before, but you don't need to see it now. If the target isn't within range or if there is no clear path to it, the dart falls to the ground, its magic spent and wasted. Otherwise, elemental winds guide the dart instantly through the air to the target. The dart can pass though openings as narrow as 1 inch wide and can change direction to fly around corners. When the dart reaches its target, the target must succeed on a **DC 16** Dexterity saving throw or take`d4`piercing damage and``dice: 3d4``lightning damage. The dart's magic is then spent, and it becomes an ordinary dart. *Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 223* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Seeker dart pota is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.

Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around seeker dart pota. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
