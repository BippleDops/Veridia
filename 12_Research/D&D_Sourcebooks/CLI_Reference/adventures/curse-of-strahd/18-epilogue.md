# Epilogue
*Source: Curse of Strahd, p. 207* 

Strahd is a deadly challenge for the characters. If they confront the vampire too soon, without the benefit of magic items such as the [[holy-symbol-of-ravenkind-cos|Holy Symbol of Ravenkind]] and the [[sunsword-cos|Sunsword]], they will likely perish. Characters can improve their chances of survival by exploring the land of Barovia, defeating lesser evils, and gaining allies, magic items, and levels of experience.

The outcome of the final showdown between Strahd and the characters determines how the adventure ends.

## Strahd Prevails

Once he is done toying with the characters, Strahd sets out to defeat them utterly, having concluded that none of them is worthy to replace him as the lord of Barovia. He won't be satisfied until all the characters are dead or turned into his vampire spawn consorts.

If Strahd prevails, he seals the characters in the catacombs (chapter 4, area K84, crypt 23) and instructs his servants to hide all their magic items.

With the characters out of the way, Strahd shifts his attention back to making [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ireena-kolyana-cos|Ireena Kolyana]] his bride. If she is still alive and within his grasp, Ireena is turned into a vampire spawn and sealed in her crypt beneath Castle Ravenloft.

## Strahd Dies

When [[strahd-von-zarovich-cos|Strahd]] is reduced to 0 hit points, he turns to mist and retreats to his coffin (see the Misty Escape feature in the [[vampire-xmm|vampire]] stat block). The vampire must be in his resting place to be utterly destroyed.

If the characters finish off Strahd in his coffin, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Strahd can't hide his surprise as death takes him into the black abyss. Surprise turns to rage, and the Pillarstone of Ravenloft trembles with fury, shaking dust from the ceiling of the vampire's tomb. The shudders abate as Strahd's burning hatred melts away, replaced at last with relief. The dark orbs of his eyes wither and sink into his skull as his corpse deteriorates before you. In a matter of moments, only bones, dust, and noble garb remain. [[strahd-von-zarovich-cos|Strahd von Zarovich]], the dark lord of Barovia, is dead and gone.

### Rahadin's Revenge

If Strahd dies but [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rahadin-cos|Rahadin]] yet lives, the dusk elf chamberlain appears moments after Strahd's demise. When that occurs, read:

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> "Master!" says a voice from behind you. An elf with dusky brown skin and long black hair, his face a mask of terror, looks on what you have wrought and screams.
^6b1

[[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rahadin-cos|Rahadin]] has served Strahd's family for hundreds of years and doesn't take his master's defeat well. The dusk elf chamberlain draws his scimitar and tries to avenge Strahd. Grief-stricken, he can't be reasoned with.

### Sergei and Ireena

This optional scene can be used after Strahd has been defeated. It assumes that [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ireena-kolyana-cos|Ireena Kolyana]] survived the adventure and hasn't yet been reunited with Sergei.

On the morning after Strahd's demise, the characters feel drawn to Castle Ravenloft's overlook (area K6), and there they witness the following scene.

> [!readaloud] 
> 
> Thick clouds fill the sky. Through the chilly morning mists, the land of Barovia is visible far below. There is peacefulness here. Rest has come to the valley for the first time anyone can remember.
> 
> A light flashes behind you. Wheeling around, you see a stately man—a being of flesh and blood—in shining armor and a flapping cape. His countenance shows great strength of will, yet the forcefulness of his presence is tempered by his calm, sad eyes. His features are those of Strahd, yet subtly different.
> 
> His voice is calm and peaceful. "My name is Sergei von Zarovich." He turns to Ireena. "Tatyana, the time is at hand to rest. Come, my love and wife." He stretches forth his hand.
> 
> [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ireena-kolyana-cos|Ireena Kolyana]]'s questioning eyes suddenly open with recognition and knowledge. Forgotten memories rush back to her. "Sergei!" she cries, springing to him with the grace of a doe. They embrace.
> 
> Ireena turns to you and says, "I am [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ireena-kolyana-cos|Ireena Kolyana]], but in my past I was Sergei's beloved Tatyana. Through these many centuries we have played out the tragedy of our lives. Now, with our deepest gratitude to you, that tragedy is over. It is time for joy to begin again."
> 
> Shimmering light surrounds Ireena and Sergei. Hand in hand, they walk east toward the edge of the overlook. Their feet do not touch the ground as they tread a path beyond this mortal world. Their invisible road takes them beyond the eastern precipice, their glow illuminating and thinning the clouds above Barovia. The clouds suddenly break open, letting shafts of glorious sunlight flood through. In the valley below, the strange fog dissolves. Barovia is free once more.

### Escape from Barovia

Strahd's death grants Barovia a reprieve. The fog that surrounds the land thins, and it no longer harms those who pass through it. The dark clouds that have loomed over the valley for centuries give way to sunshine, shocking the Barovians out of their despair.

The Barovians take the sunlight as a sign that the evil in their land has been purged. Though escape is now possible, most Barovians realize that they have nowhere to go and no reason to leave. A few depart, fearing the return of the darkness or longing to see their ancestral homelands. Those who have souls can leave the valley, while those without souls fade into nothingness as they take their first steps beyond the edge of Strahd's former domain.

### Aftermath

The bats, wolves, and dire wolves of Barovia lose their supernatural link to Strahd upon his destruction and become ordinary beasts, destined to be hunted down or driven to the farthest reaches of the Svalich Woods.

Even after Strahd's death, Castle Ravenloft remains a haunted place shunned by all Barovians. Its dark immensity and threatening countenance are enough to deter locals from plundering or reoccupying it.

#### The Rise of Ismark

If he survives the adventure, [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ismark-kolyanovich-cos|Ismark Kolyanovich]] becomes burgomaster of the village of Barovia. He is grateful to the characters for all they have accomplished and urges them to stay in Barovia and help him rid the land of its other threats, offering his village as a safe haven.

#### Vistani Exodus

Fearing that the Barovians might kill them for being spies and collaborators, the Vistani pack up their wagons and leave the valley with great haste. The Barovians are happy to see them go.

#### Vampire Hunters

If he is still alive, [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/rictavio-cos|Rudolph van Richten]] (see "Rictavio" in appendix D) leaves Barovia to live out his remaining days in solitude. His protégé, [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ezmerelda-davenir-cos|Ezmerelda d'Avenir]] (see appendix D), isn't convinced that Strahd is truly dead. She also knows that there are other evils in Barovia to be conquered, so she elects to remain in the valley.

#### Consorts Unleashed

Upon his death, Strahd's [[vampire-spawn-xmm|vampire spawn]] are freed from his control, and each seeks a new destiny. [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/escher-cos|Escher]], in particular, leaves the realm, in search of new experiences and a way to become a vampire lord himself.

If [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/patrina-velikovna-cos|Patrina Velikovna]] lives, she begins to plunder arcane knowledge from Castle Ravenloft and the Amber Temple and prepares to become Barovia's new master.

#### Strahd's Return

Ezmerelda's suspicion proves justified. Strahd's destruction is temporary, for his curse can't so easily be ended. The ancient Dark Powers with which Strahd forged his pact cause the vampire to re-form after a period of months—long enough for the Barovians to discover what it feels like to live a life of hope. When Strahd is reborn, the mists surround the land of Barovia once more, and the Barovians' hope turns to horrible despair. Strahd remembers the defeat dealt to him and begins plotting his revenge.

After the mists reappear, [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/madam-eva-cos|Madam Eva]] and her Vistani come back to the valley, the beasts of the land once more fall under Strahd's spell, and the burgomasters fortify their settlements, hoping against all hope that someone can save them from Strahd again.
