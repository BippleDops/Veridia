## Description
This handy device was invented by a gnomish craftsman of Waterdeep. The adjustable frame can be placed in a window, with the tip of the [[Bellows|bellows]] pointing out. When a gaseous incident occurs in the laboratory, a nimble mage can pump the [[Bellows|bellows]] to empty the room of the foul odor. The one-way valve in the [[Bellows|bellows]] assures that the foul air goes out and does not return. (30 gp)

## Additional Details
1 is required for a complete laboratory
