# Fire Shield
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or a firefly)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

Wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding [[bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]] in a 10-foot radius and [[dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] for an additional 10 feet.

The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you [[resistance-xphb|Resistance]] to Cold damage, and the chill shield grants you [[resistance-xphb|Resistance]] to Fire damage.

In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack roll, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes `2d8` Fire damage from a warm shield or `2d8` Cold damage from a chill shield.
