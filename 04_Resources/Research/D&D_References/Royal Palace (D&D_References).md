> The royal family carries an ancient bloodline curse that grants them natural authority and charisma but slowly drains their life force with each act of rulership. Each royal decree, each major decision literally costs years of the monarch's life. The current monarch is aging rapidly and desperately searching for a way to break the curse without losing the supernatural authority that keeps the kingdom stable. Only the royal physician and the court's most trusted advisor know the truth. > [!secret] DM Secret - The Shadow Council

> Behind the official government operates a secret "Shadow Council" of the kingdom's most powerful and wealthy individuals who actually make many of the important decisions. They meet in hidden chambers beneath the palace and communicate through a complex system of coded messages. The current monarch may or may not be aware of their existence, but they have been manipulating kingdom policy for decades to benefit their own interests while maintaining stability. > [!secret] DM Secret - The Listening Palace
> The palace itself has been magically enhanced over centuries to be a massive intelligence-gathering system. The walls literally have ears - they can record and replay conversations, and a secret network of palace staff monitors and reports on everything that happens within the palace walls. This information is used to maintain royal power and prevent coups, but it also means that no conversation in the palace is truly private. The system is so old and complex that no one fully understands how it works anymore. --- **Related Locations**:
