# Broken Creature
## Overview
### Broken Creature

A broken creature is not born. Instead, cruel techniques of coercive persuasion applied over time systematically strip away its will until it unquestioningly accepts the instruction of a master. These techniques are taught only to high-ranking members of one of the guilds that specialize in breaking creatures, such as the Grand Society of Obedience and the Sisters of Bestial Discipline. These groups have created a considerable industry of breaking creatures and selling broken creatures as reliable-yet-docile servitors within the City-State of Castorhage.

Any living creature with Intelligence 1 or higher can be broken, with the exception of familiars and animal companions. A broken creature uses the base creature’s stat blocks, with the following differences:

- Constitution increases by 2, Wisdom declines by 2.

- Has proficiency and tactical advantage on Con saving throws.

- **Dominated**: A broken creature responds to its controller as if under the effect of a dominate monster spell that can’t be dispelled or broken. There is no telepathic link; commands must be issued verbally, visually (hand signals), or aurally (whistle, drums, etc.). The creature never makes a saving throw to end the effect, even when it takes damage or is given a self-destructive command.
