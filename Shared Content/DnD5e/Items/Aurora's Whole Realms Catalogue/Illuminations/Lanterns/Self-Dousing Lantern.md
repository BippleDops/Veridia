## Description
Self-dousing [[Lanterns|lanterns]] are particularly popular with innkeepers. The [[Metal|metal]] pincers hold a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items (WOTC)/Candle|candle]] over a [[Water Reservoir|water reservoir]], and as the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items (WOTC)/Candle|candle]] burns down, drips are prevented from marring the innâ€™s furniture. But most importantly, if a tipsy patron falls asleep without extinguishing the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items (WOTC)/Candle|candle]], the water will put out the flame when the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items (WOTC)/Candle|candle]] gets low. I recommend this lantern also to sages, learned nobles, priests, and wizards who are prone to stay up late reading and might doze off over their studies. I have heard of more than one clumsy innkeeper whose life was saved when they tripped and the self-douser extinguished. (6 sp)

## Additional Details
Lights a 360-degree area out to 15 feet. Typical [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Household Accoutrements/Candles|candles]] burn from 2-3 hours, although self-dousing [[Lanterns|lanterns]] can be constructed to accommodate larger [[2.
