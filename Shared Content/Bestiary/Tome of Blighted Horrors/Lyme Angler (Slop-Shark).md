## Special Traits
**Brine Misery:** This infection is an extremely sore, itchy, red inflammation around the site of the lyme angler bite. An infected creature gains 1 level of exhaustion immediately. There is no other effect, but the disease can be cured only with a lesser restoration spell or comparable magic.

**Lantern Lure:** A bioluminescent lure dangles from the lyme angler’s forehead, giving off dim light within 15 feet. Creatures within that distance and able to see the light must make a successful DC 13 Wis saving throw or be charmed by the lyme angler. While charmed this way, an air-breathing creature won’t surface to take a fresh breath of air. A charmed creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself with a success. A creature that makes a successful save is immune to all lyme angler lantern lures for 24 hours.

## Actions
**Melee Attack—Bite:** +6 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d4 + 4` piercing damage and the creature must make a successful DC 13 Con saving throw or contract brine misery (see below).

## Description
**Environment**: Sea

**Organization**: School (1-100)

Also known as a slop-shark to those along the River Lyme, the Lyme angler is among the most ferocious of predatory fish in and around that waterway. Lyme anglers have a luminescent organ called a lantern lure at the tip of a modified dorsal ray (or fishing rod). The organ serves not only the purpose of luring prey in the warm, shallow, polluted water of the Lyme, but also serves to call males’ attention to the females to facilitate mating. The source of luminescence in this organ is a symbiotic species of brine shrimp that lives in and along the Lyme and has an affinity for the lantern lure organ of the Lyme angler. Through a complex chemical reaction, the Lyme angler is able to agitate these brine shrimp and cause them to illuminate its lure at will.

These diseased things of corruption and toxin are common in the Lyme. They have fanged-filled mouths, and their bodies are riddled with sores, infestations, and chemical burns — proof that there are places even they cannot swim safely. One of the most notorious man-eaters of the river, the biggest Lyme anglers can reach lengths of more than 20 feet and weigh up to 5,000 pounds.
