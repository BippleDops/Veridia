# Caltrop
*Adventuring gear*  


- **Cost**: 5 cp
- **Weight**: 0.1 lbs.

As an action, you can spread a single bag of caltrops to cover a 5-foot-square area. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving and take 1 piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the saving throw.

## Player-Facing Summary

Caltrop is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of caltrop as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around caltrop.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties caltrop to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at caltrop to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to caltrop active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
