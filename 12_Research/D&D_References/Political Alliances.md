## Overview

Political Alliances represents the complex web of historical relationships, power dynamics, and political maneuvering that shapes both Aethermoor and Aquabyssos. These interconnected networks of loyalty, obligation, conflict, and cooperation form the backbone of political stability and crisis across both realms. Understanding these relationships is crucial for navigating the intricate world of politics, where personal history often matters more than official policy.
