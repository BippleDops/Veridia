# Hover
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 368. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

Some creatures can hover, as noted in their stat blocks, and some spells and other effects grant the ability to hover. Hovering while [flying](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/flying-xphb.md) prevents you from falling in certain circumstances.

## Player-Facing Summary

Hover xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of hover xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around hover xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties hover xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at hover xphb to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to hover xphb active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
