## Special Traits
**Trample:** As the mastodon moves, it can enter spaces occupied by enemies up to Large size. Creatures in spaces the mastodon enters can attempt DC 16 Dexterity saving throws. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (`dice: 3d10+6`) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone; on a successful save, the creature moves 5 feet out of the mastodon's path and can make an opportunity attack if it's allowed to react. A mastodon can attempt to trample any number of creatures during its move, but it can't trample the same creature more than once per round and it can't end its movement in another creature's space.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Cold forests, hills, and plains

**Organization**: Solitary or herd (5–20 plus 5–30 calves)

## Description
The great mastodon is a distant relative of the elephant, and is linked to that creature through the woolly mammoth. It is a herbivore that lives primarily in northerly, forested areas. Its diet includes grasses, fruit, and berries, but also leaves, twigs, and branches of trees. A mastodon herd stays in an area long enough to deplete it of food, then moves on.

The mastodon has few natural predators, thanks to its great size. Humanoids who hunt the creatures for meat, for their tusks, or to train them as beasts of burden or war pose the greatest threat.

Young mastodons taken into captivity can be trained to drag great loads and to carry riders. With enough training, they can even serve as war leviathans, but they are unpredictable and impossible to control when injured.

The mastodon is slightly longer and lower than its distant relative, the elephant. Its head is longer and taller than an elephant’s, and the mastodon’s entire body is covered in thick fur.

Mastodons are generally peaceful creatures that avoid combat. They have no natural fear of any creature. If threatened, and especially if their young are threatened, mastodons fight by goring with their tusks and trampling. They are ferocious combatants when angered or wounded.
