## General Info
**Race**: Human
**Gender**: Male
**Age**: 45
**Occupation**: Docks Operations for the Shadowhaven Smugglers Ring
**Location**: [[01_Campaigns/Campaign_Name/Locations/Shadowhaven.md]] Docks

## Description
Thresh Valdris is a big, ugly man with a hook for a hand and a mean streak a mile wide. He is responsible for the Shadowhaven Smugglers Ring's operations on the docks, and he is not afraid to use violence to get what he wants.

## GM Notes
- He is a dangerous and unpredictable individual.
- He is a rival of [[01_Campaigns/Campaign_Name/NPCs/Harbormaster Willem Tidecaller.md]].
- He is a good source of information about the goings-on on the docks, but he will only talk to those who he respects.
