# Scything Blade Trap
*Generic Hazard*  

This trap uses moving blades that sweep down through a chamber, threatening anyone nearby. Typically, a scything blade trap is activated by manipulating a lever or some other simple device. Kobolds especially like this kind of trap, since it can take down bigger creatures.
