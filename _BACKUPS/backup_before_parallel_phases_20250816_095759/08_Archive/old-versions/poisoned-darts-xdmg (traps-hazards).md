--- # Poisoned Darts

*Generic Hazard* When a creature moves onto this trap's pressure plate for the first time on a turn, poisoned darts shoot from tubes embedded in the surrounding walls. The holes that house these tubes are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or skillfully hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes. Each creature in the darts' path must succeed on a **DC 13** Dexterity saving throw or be struck by`d3`darts, taking 3 (`d6`) Poison damage per dart. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Detect and Disarm As a [[actions#Search|Search action, a creature can examine the walls and make a **DC 15** Wisdom ([skills#Perception|Perception]]) check, detecting the holes on a successful check. Plugging all the holes with wax, cloth, or detritus prevents the darts from firing. As a [[actions#Search|Search action, a creature can examine the section of floor that forms the pressure plate and make a **DC 15** Wisdom ([skills#Perception|Perception]]) check, detecting the pressure plate on a successful check. Wedging an [[Iron Spikes Xphb]] or a similar object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from triggering. ## At Higher Levels You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing each dart's Poison damage as follows: 7 (``dice: 2d6``) at levels 5â€“10, 14 (``dice: 4d6``) at levels 11â€“16, or 24 (``dice: 7d6``) at levels 17â€“20. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 101. Available in the SRD* ## Player-Facing Summary Poisoned darts xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
