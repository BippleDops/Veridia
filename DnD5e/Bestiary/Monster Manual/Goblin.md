## Strategy
Here’s what we know about goblins from the Monster Manual: First, from the flavor text, they live in dark, dismal settings; congregate in large numbers; and employ alarms and traps. They’re low-Strength and high-Dexterity, with a very good Stealth modifier. Their Intelligence and Wisdom are in the average range. They possess darkvision and the Nimble Escape feature, which allows them to Disengage or Hide as a bonus action—very important to their action economy.

Because of their darkvision, goblins frequently attack under cover of darkness, when their targets may be effectively blinded (attack rolls against a blinded creature have advantage, while the blinded creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage). They’ll also attack from hiding as much as possible, making use of their high Stealth modifier, and doing so in dim light decreases the likelihood that they’ll be discovered, since many player characters will have disadvantage on Perception checks that rely on sight.

A picture of goblin combat is starting to coalesce, and at the center of it is a strategy of ambush.

A typical goblin combat turn goes Shortbow (action), move, Hide (bonus action). Because they attack from hiding, they roll with advantage. Regardless of whether they hit or miss, the attack gives their position away, so they change it immediately, because they can. (The sequence is important. Whenever possible, a goblin must end its turn hidden; otherwise, it’s vulnerable. Move/Hide/Shortbow would achieve the same offensive result but leave the goblin exposed to retaliation between turns.)

Being a Small creature, a goblin has a good chance of Hiding successfully behind the trunk of a mature tree; even if it fails, it will still enjoy three-quarters cover (+5 AC). But since you can’t hide while someone is looking directly at you, goblins have to use their movement to scramble out of the PCs’ field of view, meaning they have to be close enough for their own 30-foot movement speed to describe a significant arc. At the same time, they don’t want to be so close that a PC could close the gap between them and attack. So the optimal distance from the targets of their ambush is about 40 feet, no closer—and they don’t want to move farther from the PCs than 80 feet, their bows’ maximum range for normal shooting.

As long as they can stay out of the PCs’ reach, they’ll use this tactic over and over. Suppose, however, that a PC does manage to close with one of them. In that case, the goblin Disengages (bonus action) first. Then, depending on how great a threat the PC poses, it either Dashes (action) out of reach—forcing the PC to use a Dash action as well if they want to catch up—or, if it thinks it may be able to finish the PC off, moves its full distance to a place of cover, then Hides (action) again, preparing to attack with advantage on its next turn.

Incidentally, the goblins aren’t trying to stay together as a group. They aren’t looking out for their buddies—goblins don’t do that sort of thing. They are, however, trying to goad the PCs into splitting up.

Goblins are squishy: They have only 7 hp. One good hit will seriously wound them—and also mean that their genius sniping strategy has failed. Therefore, a goblin reduced to just 1 or 2 hp flees the scene, end of story. But a moderately wounded goblin (3 or 4 hp) is thirsty and tries to regain the upper hand. It stalks the PC who wounded it, first retreating to a safe distance, then Hiding and moving with Stealth until it can get back to around 40 feet from its quarry, at which point it returns to its Shortbow/move/Hide sniping tactic. A captured goblin surrenders immediately and grovels for mercy, counting on its ability to escape as soon as its captor’s attention wanders.

What if the PCs have the good sense to take cover themselves? Goblins aren’t brilliant, but they aren’t stupid either. They won’t waste arrows on a target that’s behind three-quarters cover, because that would completely negate the advantage they gain when shooting from hiding. Instead, a goblin stealthily repositions itself alongside or behind its target before shooting and giving its own position away. A goblin that finishes off its target doesn’t immediately go hunting after other targets. If another is already in view, it attacks that one. If not, the greedy goblin first ransacks the body of its victim for anything valuable. A clever and stealthy PC who’s counter-stalking the goblins can exploit this weakness.

So far, the entire discussion has been about ranged attacks. Goblins carry scimitars as well, but they don’t use these out in the open, because there’s no advantage to it. The only time a goblin willingly engages in melee combat is when it has some other overwhelming advantage, such as a combination of numbers, darkness, and the ability to flank, which in fifth edition D&D means attacking from two opposite sides of a target creature. (Front-and-side isn’t enough to gain advantage on attack rolls. See “Optional Rule: Flanking,” Dungeon Master’s Guide, chapter 8.)

A goblin’s +4 attack modifier isn’t quite good enough to give it two-to-one odds of hitting an armored enemy by itself, but when advantage is brought into play, a hit is almost guaranteed. If three goblins surround a PC in the dark, the chances are very good that they’ll land three hits and not have to worry about retaliation. That being said, if those three hits don’t finish the PC off, the goblins will realize that they’ve bitten off more than they can chew, and on their next turn, they’ll Disengage (bonus action), go scampering off into the darkness (movement), and Hide (action) someplace where they may later be able to land a surprise hit on a wounded foe.

Also, goblins can tell the difference between a creature that’s lost in the dark and one that has darkvision. They won’t attack the latter close up if they can avoid it; instead, they’ll prefer to shoot with their shortbows. However, in the narrow passages of a cave, establishing a good line of sight may not always be possible, and melee may be the only way to attack. If this happens, they’ll use their knowledge of the terrain to tease the party into overextending itself: A lead goblin may use its Scimitar attack (action), Disengage (bonus action), then retreat down the passageway (movement) until it comes out into a more open cavern where it and several other goblins can all jump the first PC who emerges with Readied attack actions. Meanwhile, while the PCs are being drawn forward, other goblins may shoot or stab at them opportunistically from any side passages that exist along the way. There is one other circumstance when goblins may engage in melee fighting: when commanded to do so by hobgoblins or bugbears, which goblins fear and defer to. They’ll do it, but they won’t like it. They know they’re not good at it; they’d rather be sniping. If pressed into an infantry unit, they’ll fight without coordination and desert at the first opportunity. However, that doesn’t mean they won’t keep attacking if they think there’s something to be gained by doing it their way. Goblins recognize the value of stealth and surprise, and they’re not about to let anyone get the same advantage against them. They make extensive use of alarms and traps, but since they’re not great inventors, by and large, most of these are crude: metal junk that makes a racket when disturbed, falling rocks, pits (with or without punji sticks), simple snares. Every once in a while, though, a lucky goblin may get its hands on a hunter’s trap that both restrains its victim and does damage. These are prized possessions, and the goblins use them to protect their most important locations.

The goblin boss is distinguished from ordinary goblins by its Multiattack and Redirect Attack features and by the fact that it doesn’t use a bow. Additionally, the Redirect Attack action is useful only in a context in which goblins are fighting side by side rather than in an ambush or skirmish. Based on this, I conclude that goblin bosses are found only in goblin lairs—caves, ruins, what have you—where large numbers of goblins can fight in close quarters.

By the way, have you read that Redirect Attack feature? The goblin boss uses its reaction to avoid a hit on itself and to cause it to land on one of its goblin minions instead. What a jerk! Here’s a critter that’s stronger, better at absorbing damage, and capable of landing more blows than most of its kind, and yet it possesses no notion of carrying the team. “Aw, sorry about that, Jixto! Send me a postcard from Hades!”

A creature like this, even if it fights in melee, is obnoxiously focused on selfpreservation. Fighting in a group, it begins on the front line with everyone else, using its Multiattack action to attack twice with its scimitar (note that the goblin boss’s Multiattack has disadvantage on the second swing). As soon as it’s taken even one hit, however, it changes tactics: After its Multiattack action, it Disengages (bonus action) and moves 15 feet to a position behind the front line where melee opponents can’t reach it and it has “meat cover” against ranged attacks. On subsequent rounds, it moves up to 15 feet into a nearby hole in the front line, Multiattacks (action), Disengages (bonus action), and moves back behind the front line again. (If there’s no actual hole, remember that it can move through a square occupied by an ally as if it were difficult terrain. Thus, it has just enough movement speed to go through the front line, and back, if it has to.) If the goblin boss’s minions are wiped out, it’s out of there, and ditto if it’s seriously wounded (reduced to 8 hp or fewer).
