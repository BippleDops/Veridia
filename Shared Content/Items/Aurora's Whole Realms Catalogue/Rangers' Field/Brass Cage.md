## Description
Most natural animals are trainable to some degree, growing hostile only when provoked. With our variously-sized cages, rangers can keep animals either for taming or training. Our brass cages offer are sutable (12 gp) for gnawing rodents such as ferrets and squirrels.. The cages are easily collapsible into flat and light-weight panels that fit snugly on our equipment pack. For larger creatures, see our offerings of [[Collars|collars]] and [[Leashes|leashes]].
