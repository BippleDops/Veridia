# Weapons of the Split Realms: Steel, Crystal, and Corruption

The art of weaponcraft has evolved dramatically since the sundering of the realms. In [[02_Worldbuilding/Locations/Aethermoor]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Locations/Aquabyssos]], weapons are not merely tools of war—they are expressions of the fundamental forces that shape reality itself. Each realm's unique environment and the ever-present influence of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Entities/Deep Mother]] have given rise to entirely new categories of arms.

## Regional Weapon Traditions

### Aethermoor: Resonance Weapons
In the sky realm, weaponsmiths work with crystalline materials that naturally harmonize with the [[02_Worldbuilding/Artifacts/Seven Shards]]. The [[02_Worldbuilding/Factions/The Crystal Forge Guild]] has mastered the art of "Harmonic Smithing," creating weapons that channel sonic frequencies to devastating effect.

**Resonance Blades** vibrate at specific frequencies that can shatter armor, disrupt magical shields, or even cause internal organs to rupture. The most skilled [[02_Worldbuilding/Factions/The Storm Riders]] carry "Windcutters"—swords that slice through air resistance itself, allowing for impossible aerial maneuvers.

The [[02_Worldbuilding/Locations/Floating Arsenal]] houses the legendary **Chorus of a Thousand Cuts**, a set of crystalline daggers that sing in perfect harmony when drawn together, their combined resonance capable of leveling entire buildings.

### Aquabyssos: Pressure and Corruption
In the depths, weapons must withstand crushing pressure while channeling the dark energies that seep through the water. The [[02_Worldbuilding/Factions/The Void Sculptors]] craft "Depth Weapons" from materials that have been exposed to the Deep Mother's influence, resulting in arms that grow stronger the deeper they go.

**Pressure Hammers** use hydraulic force to deliver impacts equivalent to the crushing weight of the entire ocean. **Corruption Blades** slowly poison their targets with the same madness that affects the Deep Mother's servants, their wounds festering with otherworldly taint.

The [[02_Worldbuilding/Locations/Abyssal Forges]] produce weapons that blur the line between crafted tool and living organism, their metal surfaces writhing with a life of their own.

## Legendary Weapons

### The Shard-Touched Arsenal
Seven legendary weapons were forged in the moments immediately following the Sundering, each infused with fragments of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Artifacts/Seven Shards]]:

1. **Lightrender** - A crystalline spear that fires beams of pure illumination, wielded by the first [[02_Worldbuilding/Factions/The Resonance Keepers]]
2. **Deepbane** - A pressure-forged trident that can control ocean currents, lost somewhere in the [[02_Worldbuilding/Locations/Sunken Palace]]
3. **Truthcutter** - A sword that cannot be deceived by illusion or lie, sought by the [[02_Worldbuilding/Organizations/The Truth Seekers]]
4. **Dreambringer** - A staff that can manifest nightmares as physical entities, sealed away by the [[02_Worldbuilding/Organizations/The Ethical Council of Mages]]
5. **Windwalker** - A bow whose arrows never miss and can travel between realms, property of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Factions/The Skyborne Merchants]]
6. **Voidheart** - A dagger that devours light and hope, rumored to be in the possession of the Deep Mother herself
7. **Unitybind** - A chain weapon that strengthens when multiple wielders work in harmony, currently held by the [[02_Worldbuilding/Organizations/The Unity Coalition]]

### The Mourning Blade
Crafted by the [[02_Worldbuilding/Organizations/The Chroniclers]] to commemorate the fallen of the first war against the Deep Mother, this sword carries the spirits of those who died fighting the corruption. It grows sharper with each life it takes in righteous battle, but also heavier with the weight of necessary violence.

### The Laughing Death
A weapon of pure chaos created in the [[02_Worldbuilding/Locations/Phantom Reef]], this shape-shifting implement appears as whatever its wielder finds most amusing at the moment—often a rubber chicken or oversized lollipop—while delivering absolutely lethal attacks. The [[02_Worldbuilding/Factions/The Order of the Veil]] considers it too dangerous for anyone's mental health to use.

## Weapon Classifications

### Traditional Categories
- **Slashing**: Swords, axes, and bladed implements designed for cutting
- **Piercing**: Spears, arrows, and stabbing weapons that focus force into points
- **Bludgeoning**: Hammers, maces, and weapons that deliver crushing force
- **Ranged**: Bows, crossbows, and throwing weapons for distant combat

### Realm-Specific Categories
- **Resonance**: Weapons that channel sonic and vibrational energy (Aethermoor)
- **Pressure**: Arms that utilize hydraulic force and water manipulation (Aquabyssos)
- **Corruption**: Weapons touched by the Deep Mother's influence (Aquabyssos)
- **Purification**: Arms designed specifically to cleanse corruption (Both realms)
- **Harmony**: Weapons that function best when used by multiple wielders (Cross-realm)

## Master Weaponsmiths

### Forge-Master Crystalstrike (Aethermoor)
The finest smith in the floating realm, known for creating weapons that sing with their own unique voice. Her masterwork, the **Symphony Blade**, changes its combat abilities based on the musical mode it's currently resonating in.

### Depth-Smith Pressureborn (Aquabyssos)
Born in the deepest trenches, this master craftsman creates weapons that embody the very essence of the abyss. His **Leviathan's Tooth** spear can pierce through any material known to exist in either realm.

### The Unnamed Smith
A mysterious figure who appears in both realms, crafting weapons that seem to exist partially in multiple dimensions. Their creations often exhibit properties that shouldn't be possible, leading some to believe they are either blessed by the Shards themselves or perhaps a fragment of the Deep Mother working toward unknown ends.

## Crafting Traditions

### The Ritual of First Strike
Every weapon forged in either realm must undergo the Ritual of First Strike, where it draws its first blood from its own creator. This binding ceremony ensures the weapon will serve its intended purpose and warns smiths against creating instruments of pure malice.

### Shard Resonance Testing
Weapons crafted in Aethermoor are tested for their ability to harmonize with the [[02_Worldbuilding/Artifacts/Seven Shards]]. Those that show natural resonance are marked with the [[02_Worldbuilding/Organizations/The Chroniclers]]' seal and their origins carefully recorded.

### Corruption Resistance Protocols
All weapons made in Aquabyssos undergo testing to ensure they won't be turned against their wielders by the Deep Mother's influence. The [[02_Worldbuilding/Factions/The Depth Wardens]] maintain strict standards for this process, as corrupted weapons have been responsible for numerous tragedies.

## Magical Enhancement

Weapons can be enhanced through various magical processes:

- **Enchantment Weaving**: Adding mental influence effects to weapons
- **Illusion Masking**: Making weapons appear as harmless objects
- **Elemental Binding**: Infusing weapons with fire, ice, lightning, or other elemental forces
- **Dimensional Phasing**: Allowing weapons to partially exist in multiple planes
- **Time Dilation**: Creating weapons that strike before they're swung

The [[02_Worldbuilding/Organizations/The Academy of Fundamental Truths]] maintains research into the theoretical limits of weapon enhancement, while the [[02_Worldbuilding/Factions/The Prismatic Order]] specializes in practical applications.

## Economic and Political Impact

Weapon trade forms a crucial part of the economy in both realms. The [[02_Worldbuilding/Factions/The Skyborne Merchants]] control most inter-realm weapons trafficking, while the [[02_Worldbuilding/Factions/Abyssal Courts]] regulate weapon distribution in the depths.

The [[02_Worldbuilding/Organizations/The Unity Coalition]] has proposed shared weapon development programs to strengthen both realms against the Deep Mother, but progress remains slow due to traditional mistrust and competing interests.

Recent discoveries of pre-Sundering weapons in various [[02_Worldbuilding/Locations/Archive of Echoes]] sites have sparked new debates about the relationship between ancient and modern crafting techniques, with some arguing that the art of weaponsmithing peaked before the realms were split.
