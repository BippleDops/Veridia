--- # Minor Illusion

*cantrip, Illusion* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a bit of fleece)
- **Duration:** 1 minute You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the duration. See the descriptions below for the effects of each. The illusion ends if you cast this spell again. If a creature takes a [[actions#Study|Study action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence ([skills#Investigation|Investigation]]) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Sound If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else's voice, a lion's roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends. ## Image If you create an image of an objectâ€”such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chestâ€”it must be no larger than a 5-foot [[Cube Area of Effect Xphb. The image can't create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, since things can pass through it. ## Summary **Classes**: [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 298. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* ## Player-Facing Summary Minor illusion xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of minor illusion xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around minor illusion xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## Spell Components Detail
