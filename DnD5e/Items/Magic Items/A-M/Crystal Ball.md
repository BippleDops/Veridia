# Crystal Ball

## Overview
**Type**: Magic Item

**Group**: *Wondrous item*

**Rarity**: *very rare or legendary*

**Attunement**: *requires attunement*


## Description
The typical *crystal ball*, a very rare item, is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the **[[Scrying|scrying]]** spell (save [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 17) with it.

The following *crystal ball* variants are legendary items and have additional properties.

***Crystal Ball of Mind Reading.*** You can use an action to cast the **[[Detect Thoughts|detect thoughts]]** spell (save [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 17) while you are scrying with the *crystal ball*, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. You don’t need to concentrate on this **[[Detect Thoughts|detect thoughts]]** to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if **[[Scrying|scrying]]** ends.

***Crystal Ball of Telepathy.*** While **[[Scrying|scrying]]** with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. You can also use an action to cast the **[[Suggestion|suggestion]]** spell (save [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don’t need to concentrate on this **[[Suggestion|suggestion]]** to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if **[[Scrying|scrying]]** ends. Once used, the **[[Suggestion|suggestion]]** power of the *crystal ball* can’t be used again until the next dawn.

***Crystal Ball of True Seeing.*** While **[[Scrying|scrying]]** with the crystal ball, you have [[9 - The Environment|truesight]] with a radius of 120 feet centered on the spell’s sensor.
