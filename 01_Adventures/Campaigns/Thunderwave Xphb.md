--- # Thunderwave

*1st-level, Evocation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot Cube)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous You unleash a wave of thunderous energy. Each creature in a 15-foot [[Cube Area of Effect Xphb originating from you makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes``dice: 2d8``Thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. In addition, unsecured objects that are entirely within the [Cube Area of Effect Xphb]] are pushed 10 feet away from you, and a thunderous boom is audible within 300 feet. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by`d8`for each spell slot level above 1. **Classes**: [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 334.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of thunderwave xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around thunderwave xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Alliance - Manipulate succession ## References - [[Master_Spell_Compendium
