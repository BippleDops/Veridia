# Evidence Types Guide
*Comprehensive Classification System for All Forms of Investigative Evidence*

> *"Evidence is not simply what we find - it is what we can prove, what we can trust, and what we can use to build the bridge between suspicion and truth. Every investigation begins with understanding the nature of evidence itself: how it is created, how it can be corrupted, how it must be preserved, and how it reveals the patterns that expose even the most carefully hidden conspiracies."*
> â€” [[Master Archivist Catalogus Veritas]], "The Complete Investigator's Manual: Evidence Recognition and Analysis"

## Overview

The Evidence Types Guide serves as the definitive classification system for all forms of evidence encountered during investigative work in both [[Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos]]. This comprehensive framework has been developed through over 150 years of refinement by investigators working with [[Evidence Chain Analysis]] methodology, providing systematic approaches to identifying, evaluating, authenticating, and utilizing every category of evidence that may be encountered during conspiracy investigations.

Unlike simple forensic classification systems that focus primarily on physical evidence, the Evidence Types Guide encompasses the full spectrum of information sources relevant to uncovering hidden knowledge and secret operations. This includes conventional physical and documentary evidence, but also extends to supernatural phenomena, magical traces, temporal anomalies, dimensional signatures, consciousness fragments, and reality distortions that conventional investigation methods cannot address.

The guide recognizes that powerful conspiracies employ sophisticated techniques for creating false evidence, suppressing authentic information, and manipulating the investigative process itself. Each evidence category therefore includes detailed information on authentication methods, common corruption techniques, preservation requirements, and analysis procedures specifically designed to counter the deception methods employed by entities like [[The Silverscale Conspiracy]], [[Fear Farms]], and [[The Final Choice]].

*"Evidence is the foundation upon which all truth is built. Without proper understanding of evidence - its nature, its limitations, its potential for corruption, and its capacity to reveal hidden realities - no investigation can succeed in uncovering the conspiracies that shape our world.
