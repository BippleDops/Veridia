## Description
Far superior to the northern root that bears the same name, the Maztican potato (or batata) is larger, firmer, and stores better. Trial plantings indicate the plant grows well in poor conditions, an asset for every farmer with small acreage. From my fresh tubers and rootstock you can propagate your own garden. (20 gp/lb. rootstock)
