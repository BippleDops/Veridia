He's useful for introducing party members to the darker aspects of the crystal plague while providing a potential tragic figure who might need savingâ€”or stoppingâ€”depending on how his corruption progresses. His connections span multiple factions, making him an excellent information broker and quest giver for mid-level threats. ## Player-Facing Summary Marcus Shardbreaker Grimm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
