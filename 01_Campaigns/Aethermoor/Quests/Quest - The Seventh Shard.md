## DM Secrets
> [!warning] Ultimate Truth
> The Seventh Shard is special because it contains Aetheron's heart/consciousness. Unlike the others, it can think and choose. It selected Aria as host to create a new form of divine being—neither god nor mortal. The Crimson Sage knows this and manipulates events to reunite with this piece of himself.
