# Fey Teleportation
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 74*  

**Prerequisite**: [[elf-xphb|Elf]]

Your study of high elven lore has unlocked fey power that few other elves possess, except your eladrin cousins. Drawing on your fey ancestry, you can momentarily stride through the Feywild to shorten your path from one place to another. You gain the following benefits:

- Increase your Intelligence or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
- You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan.  
- You learn the [[misty-step-xphb|misty step]] spell and can cast it once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a short or long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell.

## Player-Facing Summary

Fey teleportation xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of fey teleportation xge as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around fey teleportation xge.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties fey teleportation xge to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at fey teleportation xge to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to fey teleportation xge active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
