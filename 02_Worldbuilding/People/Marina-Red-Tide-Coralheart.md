# Marina "Red Tide" Coralheart

## Description
Marina commands attention the moment she enters a room. Her deep red hair flows past her shoulders with an almost liquid quality, seeming to move even in still air. Her sea-green eyes shift between jade and turquoise depending on her mood and the light. What most take for elaborate nautical tattoos covering her arms and neck are actually ancestral depth-marks that glow faintly when she's near large bodies of water or shard energy.

She dresses in practical sailing clothes mixed with finery stolen from a dozen ports - leather boots worth a fortune, a coat from a naval officer, rings from various "negotiations." Her voice carries the musical lilt of the Meridian docks mixed with phrases from a dozen languages. She moves with a dancer's grace and a predator's awareness.

## Background
Marina is the last known descendant of the Coralheart line, one of seven families who survived the original Aquabyssos catastrophe 300 years ago. Raised by the secret order of Depth Wardens, she was trained from childhood to recognize and protect bloodline carriers while maintaining a perfect cover identity as a smuggler and information broker.

Her public persona of "Red Tide" - notorious smuggler captain - provides the perfect cover for her true mission. Her network spans from the Eastern Kingdoms to the Forgotten Isles, built over years of careful cultivation. She genuinely enjoys the thrill of smuggling and the freedom it provides, making her cover identity as real as her true self.

## The Depth Wardens
Marina leads a secret organization descended from Aquabyssos survivors who chose to remain on the surface. They:
- Track and protect bloodline descendants
- Monitor shard locations
- Prevent premature awakening of the Deep God

- Prepare for the eventual convergence

## Secrets & GM Notes
### Hidden Motivations
1. **Prevent Premature Convergence**: Wants controlled merge, not catastrophic collision
2. **Save Both Worlds**: Believes coexistence possible with right approach
3. **Personal Investment**: Is falling for one of the party members
4. **Shadow Self**: Her shadow is more ruthless, considering genocide of surface

### Critical Knowledge
- Knows the true identity of the Crimson Sage
- Has map to two shard locations (one underwater)
- Can perform ritual to awaken bloodline carrier safely
- Possesses key to ancient Aquabyssos vault in harbor

### Plot Importance
- Provides crucial information throughout campaign
- Can reveal bloodline carrier identity when appropriate
- Bridge between surface and depth factions
- May sacrifice herself to enable worlds' merger

## Interaction Log
### Session 1
- Provided information about singing crystals
- Gave party map fragment and introduction letter
- Established transactional relationship

### Dialogue Examples
**First Meeting**: "Well, well... harbor rats with spine. Buy a drink and I might tell you something worth knowing. Try to badge me and you'll be swimming home. What's it to be, loves?"

**Information Trading**: "Information's like the tide, darling - it flows both ways. You want to know about the crystals? Tell me what our good captain's really planning."

**Flirtatious**: "Dangerous questions from dangerous people. I like that. Careful though - dive too deep and you might not like what surfaces."

**When Serious**: "Listen close, because I'll only say this once. There are currents moving beneath this city older than the stones. Some secrets are worth killing for. Others are worth dying for."

**True Identity Revealed**: "My family has guarded this secret for three centuries. We survived Aquabyssos. We remember. And we've been preparing for the day the depths return."

**About the Bloodline**: "You carry the blood of two worlds. That makes you valuable to everyone and safe with no one. Except me. I swore an oath before I was born."

## Shadow Self - Marina's Reflection
Marina's shadow has gained independence and occasionally switches places with her. The shadow:
- Is more ruthless and pragmatic
- Considers surface genocide to save Aquabyssos
- Has been building her own network
- Can travel through Aquabyssos freely
- May ally with party if original Marina dies

## Development Arc
1. **Sessions 1-3**: Playful smuggler persona, hints of deeper knowledge
2. **Sessions 4-6**: Reveals supernatural abilities and ancient connections
3. **Sessions 7-9**: True guardian nature emerges, desperate measures
4. **Session 10+**: Full revelation, choosing between worlds

## Notes for GM
- Use Marina for critical information drops
- Her network explains how party learns things
- Switch between her and her shadow for confusion
- Can provide sea-based escape routes
- If romanced, adds personal stakes to world merger
- Her death triggers Depth Warden intervention
