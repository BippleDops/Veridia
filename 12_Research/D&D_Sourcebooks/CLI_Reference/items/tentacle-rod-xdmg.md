# Tentacle Rod
*Rod, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/tentacle-rod.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This rod ends in three rubbery tentacles. While holding the rod, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to direct the tentacles to stretch outward, each one attacking a creature you can see within 15 feet of yourself. For each tentacle, make a melee attack roll with a +9 bonus. A tentacle deals `d6` Psychic damage on a hit. If you hit the same target with all three tentacles, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have the [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition until you have the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] condition, until you take a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] to release the target, or until the target is no longer within 15 feet of you. While [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] in this way, the target takes `3d6` Psychic damage at the start of each of its turns. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
