Understanding these markets provides access to restricted resources while creating ethical dilemmas about supporting criminal enterprises. ## Lore Details Criminal legends speak of the "True Market" - a mythical exchange where the fundamental laws of reality can be bought and sold. Some say this market exists in the spaces between legal and illegal, where moral absolutes become negotiable commodities and even concepts like justice and truth have fluctuating exchange rates. Deep-sea criminals tell stories of "pressure crimes" that can only be committed at extreme depths, where the physical laws become malleable enough for impossible thefts and unthinkable violations. These crimes supposedly leave no evidence that can exist at normal pressures, making prosecution impossible. ## DM Notes Use black markets as more than just sources of illegal goods - make them complex economic systems with their own rules, cultures, and moral frameworks. Criminal organizations should have logical motivations and sophisticated operations that rival legitimate businesses in complexity. Consider the moral ambiguity inherent in black markets - they often provide services that people genuinely need but cannot obtain through legal channels. This creates opportunities for players to wrestle with ethical questions about law, justice, and survival. The interconnected nature of legal and illegal economies means that disrupting black markets can have unexpected consequences for legitimate businesses and ordinary citizens, allowing for complex plots where simple solutions create new problems. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is hunting information for revenge
