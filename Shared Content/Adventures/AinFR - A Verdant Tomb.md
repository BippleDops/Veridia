# A Verdant Tomb
![[13_1476395018.webp|right|300]]

Decades ago, a powerful wizard from a distant plane of existence came to the Sword Coast as an explorer. Here she adventured as an explorer, toiled in study, and eventually departed with her young son, back to their home plane of Ravnica. She was called Sylvene, and she left behind memories of beloved allies she met and befriended in the lands of the Sword Coast. Many of those memories were celebrated and commemorated with the construction of a grand crypt in a verdant land—where she hid valuable treasures. Now, those treasures attract not only adventures but the attention of her grandson, Tyreus, whose greed for power knows no bounds.

This short Dungeons & Dragons® adventure is written to suit four to six characters of 9th level. With this text and the core D&D manuals, you have everything you need to play.

## Part of a Series
This adventure is written as the third in a five-part series. Whether you're playing this as part of our adventure series or weaving this adventure into another campaign, read "Part 3: What's Next?" to get an idea of where some of these threads lead and how you can change those threads to accommodate your campaign.

This adventure involves a recurring villain named Tyreus. More about his plans and powers can be discovered in future adventures. If you prefer not to wait, or if you want to substitute another villain in for ours, you can adapt this adventure to refer to a villainous NPC of your own.

By combining the immediacy of the players' choices with the mysterious histories and ambitions of key NPCs, this scenario explores themes of secrecy, hindsight, and loss. Future adventures in this series expand on other themes, to explore both the origins of these situations and the consequences of the players' choices along the way.

## Background
A powerful mage is at work enacting a villainous plan near the Sword Coast. He is a trespasser from another plane. He is here in pursuit of legends and lore, in the footsteps of forebears who came here long ago. He is called Tyreus, though few here know him by name.

### In Previous Adventures
Tyreus sought out the Wizard's Barrow (prior to the adventure In Scarlet Flames) after discovering a reference to it in a book that cited his grandmother, Sylvene. He tore into the Wizard's Barrow while looking for an arcane secret that might make him powerful—and worthy of his own pride—then had his minions burn the barrow's library in his wake. Tyreus found what he was looking for: a planar key that took him to a secret demiplane refuge Sylvene had created decades before. There Tyreus plundered more books (prior to the adventure in The Hidden Page), in hopes of discovering how Sylvene had created her demiplane.

Now he's found what he was looking for.

### Tyreus the Trespasser
Tyreus has been busy. This might not all become known to the characters in this adventure but can be useful for you to know when portraying Tyreus: he's been searching for the hiding place of Sylvene's unused artifacts, called keystones of creation. In her diaries and journals, he found the answers he sought and the sigils he needed to access a teleportation circle in her final secret location. Sylvene buried her keystones of creation with the man she loved, Tyreus's grandfather. Years later, she was buried there, too.

Bent on recovering the keystones for his own use, Tyreus has ventured to Sylvene's tomb, recovered the artifacts, and set traps to harrow whoever ventures to the tomb next. (And that almost certainly means the characters.)

### Sylvene's Tale
Sylvene was a wizard of the distant city-world of Ravnica who came to Faerûn to explore the possibilities of magic across the multiverse. During her time in the Realms, she met and fell in love with a human named Waltarn Everlake, a shepherd from the village of Secomber, on the verge of the High Moors. He left his mundane life to travel with Sylvene and become an adventurer, but he didn't get very far. While exploring the High Moor in pursuit of an artifact called the Stone of Creation, Waltarn perished.

He was interred in a lavish addition to his familial tomb, created by the only survivors of his adventuring party: Sylvene and a dwarven fighter called Artura Dwaircalis. They designed Waltarn's crypt to be accessible by teleportation circle in later years, so Sylvene might eventually be buried next to him.

Sylvene and Artura told almost no one else, but the expansion they built into the tombs was also created to house a treasure they plundered from the High Moors during the very adventure that got Waltarn killed: keystones of creation.

## Adventure Synopsis
The adventure is set in motion when the adventurers learn where they can find the tomb of Sylvene and Waltarn and why it is important to get inside. The adventure truly begins when they arrive at the tomb's riverside sepulcher. Getting inside and exploring the site makes up the heart of the scenario, during which the adventurers face several monsters and traps. Their venture likely culminates in a meeting with Tyreus himself—or what seems to be him. Tyreus has prepared much of the crypt as a trap to thin the ranks of adventurers who might oppose him, lording over the tomb through an illusory manifestation. In the end, the adventurers likely learn what Tyreus has stolen from the tomb—powerful fragments of an artifact called the Stone of Creation—and get a sense of his heartless plans for the future.

How the scenario ends is up the adventurers, but they may well escape with their own piece of the Stone, called a chip of creation.

## Adventure Hooks
The adventurers can become involved in this scenario in several ways, whether they're continuing along from previous scenarios or entering into the fray with this one.

### A Visitor in Secret
Adventurers looking into the origins and history of Sylvene's prior adventures—or dealing with the fallout of their own—attract the attention of Durow Dwaircalis, a dwarven veteran who has retired from the adventuring business and become a pacifist. He is the brother of Artura, who adventured with Sylvene and helped to build her tomb. Durow explains that Artura is gone on some adventure but word is spreading about Tyreus gaining power and growing careless. Durow is worried about Sylvene's secret tomb and cannot protect it himself.

(In truth, Durow is the victim of a *modify memory* spell cast by Tyreus, who "confessed" his plans for Sylvene's tomb to Durow as a means of flushing out rivals and other enemies. Tyreus has already been to Sylvene's tomb.)

### A Treasure Lost to History
If the characters have not played prior adventures in this series, they might be asked or hired to find and access Sylvene's tomb by a sage or scholar who has worked with other adventurers in the aftermath of the Wizard's Barrow discovery. Perhaps that sage has even been approached by Durow but is unwilling or unable to go to the High Moors himself. The sage wants to know the fate of the mysterious wizard, Sylvene, and any knowledge she had gathered about the Stone of Creation. The adventurers are his agents in the field.

# Part 1: Riverside
The adventure begins when the adventurers reach the area near the sepulcher, about 40 miles east of the village of Secomber. There the south branch of the Delimbiyr (sometimes called Hark River) runs through reedy marshlands along the feet of cliffs and steep hills that rise to form the High Moors' plateau.

The place they seek is a shrine and once-beautiful mausoleum built by a few wealthy families from Secomber. It is set into a cliff on the south side of the river. Designed to be rustic and remote, the site has fallen into severe disrepair as a result of its distance from Secomber. Many of the families whose ancestors were interred here have since taken their wealth to Waterdeep and never returned. After visitors stopped arriving to remember those buried here, no one came to combat the weather and the waters as they took their toll.

Only one of the participating families stayed in Secomber but fell on hard times decades ago and gradually came to forget their forebears. Their family name was Everlake. The last of them died of old age within the past twenty years.

### The Surrounding Area
The land immediately around the sepulcher is unkempt, avoided even by the goats and sheep of the few shepherds in the region. Trees are rare here. Stray boulders and scrub plants abound.

>>Cold, windswept rain billows across the reeds and grasses uphill from the river. Water runs off the hills above in muddy streams, bringing dead leaves and clumps of grasses into damp heaps. A single, dead tree bends in the wind, like a bony hand grasping at the sky.
>>

The grassy ground rises up gradually from the riverbank to where the sepulcher is built into the base of a scrabbly 20-foot cliff. Bits of red granite jut from the cliff and the ground, revealed over long years by the river and the rain. Across the river, wide meadows and wild hedges feed the local sheep.

Two **trolls** stalk the marsh on the sepulcher's side of the river. They're twin brothers, clad in rough leather and raw sheep's wool. They hunt along the riverbank at this time of year, looking for strays from nearby flocks. They attempt to stay out of sight and avoid adventurers, but trespassers who seem especially vulnerable or those who are laden with supplies and treasure stir the trolls' greed, inspiring them to ambush the party.

Five **will-o'-wisps** haunt the sepulcher yard, day or night. They are prideful, spiteful things eager to lead living creatures near the waters of the sunken yard or into the clutches of other nearby monsters. Yet each will-o'-wisp is loath to venture inside the sepulcher, which they consider the territory of other, more limited undead. The wisps take pride in moving about outdoors, by sunlight or moonlight. They delight in making other encounters more difficult but never venture deeper into the structure than area 4.

Note that much of the muddy, soaked ground surrounding the sepulcher may be difficult terrain. The sepulcher grounds and the crypts within are shown in map 1.

![[13_1476395029.webp|right|300]]

> ##### Be Careful About Piling On
>The will-o'-wisps can make any encounter here more difficult, so use them sparingly. These creatures raise the stakes for any adventurer who drops to 0 hit points, but raising the stakes isn't always required. These particular will-o'-wisps are also selfish and cowardly, they seldom work together. And these aren't their graves they're defending. They simply like the ambiance of a rotten sepulcher.
>

### 1. Sunken Yard

>>The grounds around the sepulcher are flooded by rain and overflow from the nearby river. Mud and leaves form clogs in the reeds, trapping water in a rough pond surrounded by cattails. The water looks to have partly flooded the sepulcher itself through a few cracks in the facade wide enough to squeeze through.
>>

The pond is about 4 feet deep. Its bottom is a mix of sucking mud and fallen rocks.

The masonry of the structure's face is eroding from both sides, thanks to the water feature in area 4 and the soaked earth here. Small and Medium-sized creatures can move through the largest crack in the facade; a Large creature can squeeze through it.

Last spring, three **water weirds** flowed into this area when the river overflowed. They remain here still, swirling through the water like transparent snakes and steeping in a sense of sorrow and pride from the crypts beyond. They do not threaten the other monsters that dwell here, but they waste no time attacking those they deem trespassers.

### 2. Garden Shrine

>>A stone arch leans in the tall grass here where the slab it on which it once stood has been overwhelmed. The arch frames a small altar and shelf built into a waisthigh alcove in the front of the sepulcher. The top of the altar is a stone bowl for offerings, flanked by two stone settings meant to hold candles or oil for burning.
>>

This ritual shrine was intended as a way to allow visitors to honor the interred even when the sepulcher was sealed. The fact that the shrine has not been used in years has emboldened the will-o'wisps in the surrounding area.

A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check recalls prayers and other customary rites suitable for the shrine, all of which involve lighting candles or lamp oil, or casting light. If the shrine is lit, it attracts all remaining will-o'-wisps at the sepulcher. They arrive angry, ready to attack, and do not leave until the shrine is darkened or they are destroyed.

### 3. Sepulcher Entrance

>>The door to the mausoleum beyond hasn't been used in a long time. Caked mud and rusted hinges hold the iron gate fast. Behind that, a stone slab with two metal loops set into it, for ropes, stands firm—more of a seal than a door.
>>

The names of the mausoleum's three founding families are carved above the entrance: Springbank, Dalmoor, and Everlake.

It takes a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check to open the iron gate. Unsealing the stone slab requires a successful DC 20 check.

Loudly opening the iron gate or unsealing the stone slab likely alerts all creatures in the mausoleum as far as area 7.
---
# Part 2: Inside the Crypts
The first areas inside the mausoleum are open to each other and can quickly become a single, harrowing encounter.

The last humanoid trespassers at this site—before the adventurers—were here to loot the place. Four human grave-robbers swam in through the facade a few years ago and, after ransacking area 5, attracted the attention of a shambling mound that often stalks this area. It is likely still here when the adventurers intrude. Its hulking mass includes the bones of the grave-robbers now.

Bound to the shambler and the bones within it is a wraith formed from the hateful greed of the lead grave-robber. The wraith haunts its grave, which is essentially inside the shambling mound. The wraith doesn't attack the shambler; it goes where the shambler goes.

The other three grave-robbers now haunt this place as three specters under the wraith's command. They tend to gather in area 6, near the treasures they collected.

#### General Features
The tombs demonstrate fine designs and quality work, all allowed to rot through neglect.

#### Construction
The interior spaces here were meant for somber memorials and funeral services. The stonework was well done but has been slowly sinking and sagging in mud over decades. The marble floors and carved walls are no longer plumb but are not dangerous.

#### Ceilings
Most ceilings throughout the tombs are arched to a height of 8 feet. Many are painted with murals of cloudy-blue or starry-night skies, flaking and moldy now.

#### Light
No natural light makes it into the mausoleum, except for a bit of overcast spill lighting in area 4. Every chamber has iron sconces for torches or lanterns, but no torches or lanterns remain.

#### Sound
Marble floors and walls carry footfalls, voices, and other echoes throughout the place.

### 4. Ceremonial Chamber

>>Part of this room is partially submerged in green water, filling what might have once been a ceremonial pool. The rest of this marble chamber is a few stairs above the water line, but still mossy and slick with algae.
>>

This space was intended for quiet contemplation and solemn services to honor the dead. It served those purposes for many years. Now it is rotting and crumbling. Loose treasures of monetary value were carried from here into area 6 by the grave-robbers before they died.

### 5. Northern Crypt

>>The green, iron gate meant to close off this chamber has been pried open. Part of the latch still clings to the marble frame. The stone sarcophagi inside appear intact, but the place is a mess of leaves, mud, and toppled urns.
>>

This area was thoroughly looted by the grave-robbers a few years ago. All items of monetary value are now in area 6, where the robbers took them before they died.

### 6. Southern Crypt

>>The iron gate meant to guard this chamber hangs on its last hinge. The room beyond is stained with mud and blood, littered with torn clothes and cast-off buckles. A rusty axe juts from dead vines and reeds tangled in the muddy floor.
>>

The grave-robbers fled here to save their spoils and their lives from the attack of the shambling mound. They failed. Amid inches of mud and debris on the ground are their rotting backpacks and the treasures they gathered.

If they have not already, the three specters attack when "their" treasures are disturbed here.

***Treasure.*** The grave-robbers had gathered grave goods, candlesticks, metal fixtures, and other art objects worth a total of 440 gp, plus a *spell scroll* of *lesser restoration*, a *potion of healing (greater)*, and a *chime of opening*.

### 7. Grand Mausoleum

>>This wide, grand hall hosts rows of sealed compartments for coffins and urns. The room is angled roughly to the west, where it has settled unevenly. Water has clearly half-flooded this room before, based on the water damage and masses of rushes, vines, and reeds clinging to the mossy walls. Golden pans, meant to hold lamp oil, hang from the ceiling.
>>

The leader of the grave-robbers had barely set foot in this chamber when he was attacked. As such, it faintly glitters with traces of silver and gold from chalices, medals, statuettes, and other mementos.

A total of thirty-six people were interred in the eastern wall of this chamber. As was the custom in Secomber, none of them were interred with treasures of note.

***Development.*** If the shambling mound and the wraith have not yet appeared, they are here.

***Treasure.*** Many mementos scattered throughout this chamber have rotted to junk, but gold trinkets, silver funerary items, and other personal treasures of value remain, altogether worth 540 gp.

### 8. Processional Corridor

>>The door to the area beyond is clearly an addition to the chamber but is still probably decades old. The red granite in the doorway may have been sealed once, but gaps have formed as the mausoleum has sunk.
>>

The threshold above the doorway to area 8 is etched with the name Everlake. Prying open this broken seal requires a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check.

In the corridor, 30 feet beyond the once-sealed doorway, Sylvene installed one of her magic stele traps, facing this door. It has disadvantage on its passive Perception score to detect trespassers peering through the gaps in the doorway.

***Magic Stele Trap.*** The stele can detect trespassers out to a range of 60 feet in front of it. It has a passive Perception score of 18. To disarm or dispel this trap requires a successful DC 18 check. When triggered, the trap emits a bolt of lightning 60 feet long. Any creature in the target area that fails a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage, or half as much damage with a successful save.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. This stele can emit lightning a total of three times before becoming nothing more than inert stone.

> ##### Medallion of Safe Passage
>Marks of safe passage found in the Wizard's Barrow, in a previous adventure, also work here. Creatures wearing a medallion of safe passage do not trigger the magic stele trap but are not immune to its lightning if it is triggered by someone or something else.
>

Aside from housing the trap, this corridor is meant simply to set Waltarn's crypt deeper into the cliff face, to protect it from erosion and settling for a time.

>>Red granite supports and details, from rock frequently mined along the nearby cliffs, enliven the gray stones here. Although this corridor is clearly of more recent construction, it struggles against the shifting ground, too. Fitted stones are being pulled apart from each other over years of slow movement.
>>

The corridor is in considerably better shape at its north end, where a second seal was installed to further prevent intrusions. This slab is better seated in place, requiring a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to force open.

### 9. Tiled Passage

>>The passage here is decorated with fine tile in an abstract, dwarven style. Though the stairs have settled unevenly, the passage itself is level and tidy.
>>

This short passage was a gift to Sylvene from Artura, to wow her upon her entrance to the site for Waltarn's burial. It was never intended to be trapped, but it is now. This is as far as Tyreus ventured into the tomb after entering through area 11. He left two traps here using *linked glyphs* (see appendix A). Finding any of these glyphs requires a successful DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check.

First, an alarm glyph has been placed on the stairs (A) to alert Tyreus and let him know it is time for him to cast *project image* and appear in area 11.

Secondly, a detection glyph has been placed on the stairs in almost the same spot (A), linked to an effect glyph (B), which casts *fear* (DC 17) up the stairs to the east when any humanoid creature touches or passes over the detection glyph.

Tyreus's aim is to drive frightened intruders toward the spell glyphs in area 10.

![[13_1476395042.webp|right|300]]

### 10. Memorial Chamber

>>This gray chamber features half-pillars, arches, and recessed murals in excellent condition. The south wall shows a wide, shining lake amid green highlands, all beneath brilliant clouds. The north wall is divided into four stylized portraits depicting a female dwarf, a male human, a female human, and, judging by the scale of the details, a male giant.
>>

The highland lake is a depiction of Highstar Lake in the northern region of the High Moors—a spot Waltarn loved when he visited it with his fellow adventurers. The murals are works by the Waterdhavian artist Saraque Skyhill.

The four figures depicted here are the members of Sylvene's final adventuring party, as commissioned by Sylvene. From left to right:

- Artura Dwaircalis
- Waltarn Everlake
- Sylvene herself
- Hamish Hewland

Tyreus hated this room. He has hidden a glyph of warding on Waltarn's face, created to cast *phantasmal killer* on the first humanoid to get within 5 feet of the glyph.

### 11. Grand Crypt

>>From the vaulted, blue-and-gold ceiling to the circular, brass seal in the floor and the twin, bare-stone sarcophagi, this tomb looks lavishly made and firmly intact.
>>

This chamber's sarcophagi contain the coffins of Sylvene and Waltarn—unopened and intact—plus a recessed prayer area to the north and a ritual cleansing area to the south. The pillars that support the area are carved with spiral whorls like the stele outside the Wizard's Barrow (from In Scarlet Flames). All the metal fixtures in this area have a green patina and are made to form similar spirals where they can.

Sylvene didn't return to the Sword Coast as she intended to, and her sarcophagus here is empty. (She is interred somewhere in Ravnica.)

The brass seal is the site of an etched and dyed teleportation circle. It was used by Sylvene to visit the site, by Artura to attend to maintenance here, and by Tyreus to plunder the crypt.

While here, Tyreus removed five keystones of creation from the crypt. They were set in the eastern wall and had never been attuned, so soon their power can still be his.

***Development.*** If he can arrange it, Tyreus appears to be standing in the teleportation circle when the adventurers arrive. (It is actually an illusory image of Tyreus, who is hundreds of miles away at Highstar Lake and making use of a *project image* spell.)

The human before you appears pale but flushed, with dark hair in a long braid and an exquisitely trimmed beard. He wears dark, fitted clothes and high boots along with a fine blue overcoat. He looks relieved that you're here.

Tyreus wanted to see the adventurers, both to satisfy his curiosity and to help him scry on them, if they survive his trap. He intends to let one of the adventurers escape to sow fear.

In the meantime, Tyreus is happy to converse with the adventurers and learn what he can from them. He tries to keep their attention on him so his minions can close in on them: Tyreus has placed two tenebrous assassins in the crypt. They arrived with him earlier and he left them behind. They have taken up hiding spots in the crypt and attempt to avoid detection by the adventurers until Tyreus gives the order to attack.

***Trap.*** Tyreus' final trap is a pair of linked glyphs: a detection glyph (A) on the ground between the coffins and an effect glyph (b) to create a wall of fire that blocks the entrance.

***Treasure.*** Funeral goods, mementos, prayer objects, and other nonmagical treasures in the area are made predominantly of silver, worth a total of 510 gp. In a prayer bowl in the northern area of the crypt waits more treasure, overlooked by Tyreus when he was here: two *chips of creation* (see appendix B).

> ##### Variant: Tenebrous Assassins
>Tyreus's assassins are shadowy monstrosities he found deep in underground warrens beneath Ravnica. They have pebbly, gray, hairless skin, no mouths, and no capacity for speech. They do not require food or drink but do breathe and sleep. If slain, they dissolve into smoke, leaving behind their equipment.
>
>These assassins believe Tyreus is coming back for them, but that is unlikely.
>

#### Tyreus Came to Talk
Tyreus likes to hear himself talk. He believes himself to be uniquely clever and unfairly lonely. He isn't worried about the adventurers' capacity to get in his way at this stage. He'd rather gloat, order their elimination, and talk while they fight his assassins.

In so doing, Tyreus might mention the following:

- He only recently learned—from diaries he took from Sylvene's libraries—that Waltarn Everlake was his grandfather. He's not impressed with Waltarn; Tyreus considers him a weak, common simpleton.
- Waltarn and his family didn't want him brought back to life after he was slain on an adventure. "What cowards," Tyreus might say. "What a lack of vision."
- Tyreus took the five keystones of creation Sylvene attempted to hide here with Waltarn. With them, he will "create for myself a place worthy of the followers I deserve."

# Part 3: What's Next
The adventurers have new information as well as questions about what's next. The subsequent adventure leads deeper into the High Moors to seek the dangerous lair where Waltarn perished. There, vital secrets about the Stone of Creation are kept.
---
# Appendix A: New Spells
Tyreus uses the *linked glyphs* spell to trap Sylvene's tomb against interlopers like the adventurers. If this spell becomes known to others, it can appear on the bard, cleric, wizard, and artificer spell lists. The spell mighty fortress first appeared in Xanathar's Guide to Everything, and is included here for reference.

- *Linked Glyphs*
- *Mighty Fortress*
---
# Appendix B: New Artifacts
A piece of this new artifact can be found in Sylvene's crypt, in area 11. The keystone from the previous adventure was created by Sylvene using pieces of the Stone of Creation.

- *Stone of Creation*
- *Chip of Creation*
- *Keystone of Creation*
