### Spite-Waif
![[hjyjzu3u.nx0.png|Spite-Waif|300]]
[[hjyjzu3u.nx0.png|open outside]]

*The figure is childlike, but any sense of innocence is immediately overshadowed by the aura of malevolence that exudes almost palpably from it. Its flesh is gray and pasty, seemingly too loose for its body. Its head is hairless with a wide mouth and distended jaw full of needlesharp teeth, and, though humanoid in shape, when it moves it scuttles about on all fours like some kind of insect with too many joints.*

## Special Traits
**Mirror Portal (1/day):** As an action, a Spite-Waif can turn a normal mirror into a portal between the Material Plane and Between. The Spite-Waif must touch the mirror to be transformed. The portal forms behind the mirror, which must be pushed aside to get at the portal. The portal can be used by any creature that fits through it; the portal is the same size as the mirror. It remains open indefinitely or until the Spite-Waif creates a different mirror portal or the mirror is broken.

**Create Mirror-Portal (1/day).** A Spite-Waif can turn a normal mirror into a portal between the Material Plane and Between. To use this ability a mirror must be obtained from the Material Plane and taken to Between where the Spite-Waif must conduct a 1-hour ritual to attune the mirror and turn it into a device for scrying. It is then able to scry through any Material Plane mirror for a suitable location to use as a portal. Once a location has been determined, the mirror-portal is created and fixed between the two mirrors, and the Spite-Waif’s mirror cannot be attuned to any other mirror. Once the mirrors have been attuned, the portal can be opened from either end by simply sliding the mirror aside as a part of movement and revealing the extradimensional portal behind it. Anyone can pass through the mirror-portal as long as they can fit through the dimensions of the mirror’s pane. Once created, a mirror-portal remains open indefinitely until closed. If closed, it can no longer be opened except by the Spite-Waif that created it. If either mirror is destroyed, the mirror-portal is closed permanently.

**Perfect Copy:** When a Spite-Waif uses alter self, it can assume the appearance of a specific individual. Unlike a doppelganger, when a Spite-Waif is killed it remains in its assumed form unless a dispel magic is cast on the corpse.

**Spell-like Abilities:** The Spite-Waif can use the following spelllike abilities, using Charisma as its casting ability (DC 11). The Spite-Waif doesn’t need material components to use these abilities.

*At will:* alter self

*1/day:* sleep

These creatures are insidious changelings and infiltrators from Between. Spite-waifs are an immature stage in the development of a doppelganger that are native to that bizarre realm. While they have the doppelganger’s ability to change shape, they lack its physical power and ability to read minds. As a result, they are used primarily as changelings to replace children of the Material Plane, and then grow up within that child’s household and live its life. The reasons for these switches are manifold, but they are universally of malign intent. This is especially evident in the fact that unlike hags, who swap changelings out for real children and then raise the true child as its own, the Spite-Waif usually devours the child at the time of the switch.

Superficially, spite-waifs physically resemble a small humanoid child but with a doppelganger’s characteristic gray and formless skin and features. Its jaw is able to distend to allow it to swallow creatures up to Medium size, and a mouthful of needle-sharp teeth help it grip its prey. Internally, the Spite-Waif’s abdomen is an extra-dimensional space that can hold any amount of prey. Horrifically, the parents of switched children are frequently concerned about a possible stomach ailment afflicting their “child” when they change its bedclothes, not aware of the true source of its exceptionally soiled and sometimes bloody diapers.

A Spite-Waif can maintain its charade for years, altering its regularly as it “grows,” and usually does so for the entire childhood and adolescence of the replaced child. In many ways, they become that child, assuming all of its roles and eventual responsibilities, though it always maintains some form of contact with its own kind — even if only a quick meeting once every few years — to stay current on the planned reasons for the switch. The reasons and plans for a changeling switch are always extremely far-reaching, taking decades to develop, and frequently involve replacing a child from a prominent family in order to attain a powerful position in government later in adulthood.

While a Spite-Waif remains in Between, it doesn’t mature physically or in Between Age. A Spite-Waif that dwells on the Material Plane grows at a rate comparable to the species it mimics. When a Material Plane-dwelling Spite-Waif reaches physical maturity (usually within 10–12 years), it attains Medium size and completes its transformation into a full non-Between doppelganger, becoming in all ways at this point a normal doppelganger, though likely maintaining any prior contacts with its Between compatriots.
