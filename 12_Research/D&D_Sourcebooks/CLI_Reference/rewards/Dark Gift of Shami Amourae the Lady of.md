# Dark Gift of Shami-Amourae, the Lady of Delights
*Charm*  

Shami-Amourae's gift is the power of persuasion. This dark gift allows its beneficiary to cast the [[Suggestion Xphb]] spell as an action, and saving throws against the spell have disadvantage. After it has been used three times, the dark gift vanishes.

The beneficiary of this dark gift gains an extra finger on each hand, as well as the following flaw: "I can't get enough pleasure. I desire others to create beauty for me at all times."
