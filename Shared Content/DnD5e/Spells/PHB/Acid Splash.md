# Acid Splash
You hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one creature you can see within range, or choose two creatures you can see within range that are within 5 feet of each other. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `dice: 1d6|avg` (1d6) acid damage.

This spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (`dice: 2d6|avg` (2d6)), 11th level (`dice: 3d6|avg` (3d6)), and 17th level (`dice: 4d6|avg` (4d6)).
