## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing a demilich's lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Enervating Domain.** Whenever a creature other than the demilich or one of its allies finishes a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]] within 1 mile of the lair, the creature must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or have its [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Point]] maximum reduced by `d4`. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]] outside that area.  
- **Travel Ward.** Creatures can't use teleportation or planar travel to enter or exit the lair.  

If the demilich dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

## Player-Facing Summary

Demilich xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of demilich xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around demilich xmm.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
