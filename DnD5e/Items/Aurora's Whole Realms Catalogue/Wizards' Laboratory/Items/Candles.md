## Description
These mundane [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Wizards' Laboratory/Items/Items|items]] are among the most versatile tools in the lab. Those of you new to the laboratory will quickly learn that candles can provide far more than light. We offer timekeeping candles (1 gp), which are notched to indicate the passage of hours and half-hours; incense candles (1 gp), which can clear foul odors from the laboratory; vial heaters (1 sp), which burn long and steadily; and typical tapers (1 sp), which provide excellent light for reading. All candles come in red, black, yellow, or uncolored versions.

## Additional Details
30 of each type are requisite for a complete laboratory
