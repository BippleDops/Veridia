Goldspire Port stands as the closest major Confederacy city to Aethermoor, a gleaming trade hub where merchants, spies, and refugees mingle. Built into towering golden cliffs, the city watches Aethermoor's crisis with calculating interest, serving as both potential salvation and threat. ## Description

**Details**: Rich sensory elements bring this to life.

The city rises in seven terraced levels carved into coastal cliffs of golden sandstone. Each level represents a different economic class, with mechanical lifts powered by steam and clockwork (deliberately avoiding crystal technology) connecting them. The harbor below bristles with ships from across the known world, while the summit holds the Confederate Trade Council's fortress-palace. ### The Seven Tiers

1. **Tide Ward** - Docks, warehouses, and sailor quarters
2. Furthermore, **Merchant Quarter** - Shops, markets, and trading houses
3. **Craft District** - Workshops and guild halls (crystal-tech research labs)
4. **Embassy Row** - Foreign delegations and refugee quarters
5. **Gold Gardens** - Wealthy merchant estates
6. **Confederate Heights** - Government buildings and military
7. **The Spire** - Trade Council's palace and intelligence headquarters ### The Refugee Quarter


A growing district in Embassy Row where Aethermoor expatriates gather, bringing crystal corruption fears with them. Heavily monitored by Confederate agents. ### The Vault

Secret facility where confiscated crystal artifacts are studied and neutralized. Run by the Department of Existential Threats. ### The Market of Whispers

Information brokerage where intelligence about Aethermoor is bought and sold. [[Zephyr Goldwhisper|02 Worldbuilding/People/Zephyr Goldwhisper]] maintains an office here. ## DM Secrets

> [!warning] The Confederate Solution

> The Trade Council has approved "Operation Goldfall" - if Aethermoor's corruption spreads beyond its borders, they'll implement total quarantine and bombardment. The city has massive crystal-ifying weapons ready to deploy. > [!danger] The Economic War
> Goldspire is deliberately manipulating Aethermoor's economy to force annexation. They're buying up debts, creating supply shortages, and preparing to offer "aid" that comes with sovereignty-surrendering conditions. > [!info] The Refugee Underground
> Not all refugees support the Confederacy's plans. A resistance movement called "Free Aethermoor" operates from the Refugee Quarter, smuggling supplies and information back home. ### The Crystal Museum

Displays "safely contained" artifacts from Aethermoor, propaganda tool showing Confederate superiority over crystal corruption. ### The Neutrality Towers

Massive devices that create a field preventing crystal energy within the city. Side effect: any corrupted individual entering experiences excruciating pain. ## Player-Facing Summary Goldspire Port is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Goldspire Port as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Goldspire Port. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The First Prophecy of Shadows ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
