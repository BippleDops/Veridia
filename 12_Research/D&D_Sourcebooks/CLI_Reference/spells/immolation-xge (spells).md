# Immolation
*5th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Flames wreathe one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes `8d6` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, the target also burns for the spell's duration. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes `4d6` fire damage on a failed save, and the spell ends on a successful one. These magical flames can't be extinguished by nonmagical means.

If damage from this spell kills a target, the target is turned to ash.

**Classes**: [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-evoker-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Wizard (Evoker)]]; [[list-spells-classes-sorcerer|Sorcerer]]; [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]; [[list-spells-classes-wizard|Wizard]]
