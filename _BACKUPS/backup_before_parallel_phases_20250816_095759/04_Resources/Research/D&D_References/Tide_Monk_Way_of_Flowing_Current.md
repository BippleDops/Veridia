The Tide Monk represents an ancient martial tradition that teaches practitioners to move like water itselfâ€”fluid, adaptable, and inexorable. These monks have learned to channel the power of ocean currents through their bodies, becoming living embodiments of the sea's eternal flow. They serve as guardians of underwater monasteries, masters of aquatic combat, and keepers of ancient tidal wisdom. ## Core Concept

Tide Monks follow the Way of the Flowing Current, a monastic tradition that emphasizes adaptation, persistence, and the power of seemingly gentle forces to overcome any obstacle. They can move through water with supernatural grace, redirect attacks like ocean currents, and strike with the accumulated force of tidal waves. Many serve as monastery guardians, underwater messengers, or spiritual guides for those seeking to understand the ocean's deeper mysteries. ### Monastic Tradition: Way of the Flowing Current
