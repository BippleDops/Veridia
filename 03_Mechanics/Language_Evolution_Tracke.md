# Language Evolution Tracker

## Convergence Effects
- Semantic Drift: Common words shift meaning near shard sites; insight checks to avoid faux pas.
- Pidgin Rise: Dockside creoles blend Aquan, Trade Cant, and Aetheric.
- Ritual Residue: Words of power leave echoes that smart items can detect.

## Emerging Pidgins
- Reefsign: Silent gesture language for underwater trade.
- Aethercant: Crystal-field slang; short, clipped, efficient.
- Port-Meridian Trade: Flexible grammar; absorbs borrowings fast.

## Lost Tongues Recovering
- Thalassic: Liturgical; unlocks shortcuts in the Sunken Library.
- Pre-Submersion Common: Maps and land deeds; grants advantage when authenticating documents.

## Words of Power
- Speakable only with consent or components; attempt without causes psychic feedback (1d4).
- Proper syllables can suppress minor anomalies for 1 minute.

## Translation Challenges
- Misread oaths can invert contracts in Quiet Chapels.
- Reconstructed scripts demand multi-skill checks (History + Arcana).
