--- # Extreme Heat

*Environmental Hazard* When the temperature is 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, a creature exposed to the extreme heat and without access to drinkable water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain 1 [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion level. The DC is 5 for the first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour. Creatures wearing Medium or Heavy armor have [Advantage Xphb]] on the save. Creatures that have [[boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats) or [immunity-xphb (variant-rules)]] to Fire damage automatically succeed on the save. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 68* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Extreme heat xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
