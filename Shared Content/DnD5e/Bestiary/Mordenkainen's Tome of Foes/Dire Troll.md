***Whirlwind of Claws (Recharge 5-6).*** Each creature within 10 feet of the troll must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 44 ( `dice: 8d10`) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Description
Trolls kill and eat almost anythingâ€”including, in rare cases, other trolls. This cannibalism has the effect of causing the troll to grow to an unusually large size. These dire trolls crave more and more troll flesh to fuel their continued growth.

Dire trolls also increase their size by grafting flesh and organs onto themselves. When a slab of quivering troll flesh is bound against a fresh wound on the dire troll, its regenerative capacity incorporates the new mass into its own musculature. Even more horrifying are the multiple arms, eyes, claws, and other organs that a dire troll tears from its victims and grafts onto itself. Over time, these creatures can accumulate many limbs.

**Vaprak the Destroyer**

Although trolls are hardly devout and seldom ponder spiritual questions, they do fear and venerate the entity known as Vaprak the Destroyer. As with many lesser deities, Vaprak's true nature is something of a mystery, but it is always portrayed as a horrid, misshapen, greenish creature strongly resembling a troll. It's given to fits of mindless destruction and is constantly paranoid about the plots and ambitions of other deities.
