## Traits

### Age

Goblins reach adulthood at age 8 and live up to 60 years.

### Size

Goblins are between 3 and 4 feet tall and weigh between 40 and 80 pounds. Your size is Small.

### Darkvision

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Fury of the Small

When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell and the creature's size is larger than yours, you can cause the attack or spell to deal extra damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your level. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Nimble Escape

You can take the [[actions#Disengage|Disengage]] or [[actions#Hide|Hide]] action as a bonus action on each of your turns.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin.

## Player-Facing Summary

Goblin vgm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of goblin vgm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around goblin vgm.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties goblin vgm to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at goblin vgm to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to goblin vgm active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
