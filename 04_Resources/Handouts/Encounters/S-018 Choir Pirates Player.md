# Choir Pirates

Their ships sing as they close. Your rigging answers with a hum you can feel in your teeth.

What you notice
- Prismatic scars on enemy hulls
- The air thrumming with a single note

What you can try
- Disrupt the song
- Outmaneuver the formation
- Brace for a boarding attempt

Possible outcomes
- The chord breaks and they falter
- The song stuns for a heartbeat
- Grapnels bite the rails
