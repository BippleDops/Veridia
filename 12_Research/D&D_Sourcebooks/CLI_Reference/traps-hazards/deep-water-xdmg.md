# Deep Water
*Environmental Hazard*  

Swimming through deep water (more than 100 feet deep) presents additional challenges because of the water's pressure and cold temperature. After each hour of swimming in deep water, a creature that lacks a Swim Speed must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] level.
