--- # Keoghtom's Ointment

*Wondrous item, uncommon* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/keoghtoms-ointment.webp#right) This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains``dice: 1d4` + 1`doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh 1/2 pound. As a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize action, you can swallow one dose of the ointment or apply it to a creature within 5 feet of yourself. The creature that receives it regains``dice: 2d8` + 2`[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] and ceases to have the [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned condition. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 275.
