# Dracolich

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing a dracolich's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Sapping Mist.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is [[lightly-obscured-xphb|Lightly Obscured]] by pale fog. Whenever a creature other than the dracolich or one of its allies finishes a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]] in that area, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] level.  
- **Soul Drain.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair have [[disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on Death Saving Throws.  

If the dracolich is destroyed or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. The effects resume if the dracolich gains a new body (see its Soul Gem trait).
