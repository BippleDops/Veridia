--- # Ecosystem Simulation Engine Simulates food chains, migrations, predator-prey, weather, symbiosis, and extinction/evolution impacting play. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Extinction/Evolution Triggers

- Thresholds: Overuse, merger shifts, Deep Mother pulses
- Evolution grants new traits; extinction creates voids filled by horrors Integration: Affects trade goods, travel safety, and faction stability. Hooks into [[Journey_Event_Compiler|Journey Event Compiler. ## Player-Facing Summary Ecosystem Simulation Engine is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Ecosystem Simulation Engine as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Ecosystem Simulation Engine. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Strange sightings suggest ancient magic
