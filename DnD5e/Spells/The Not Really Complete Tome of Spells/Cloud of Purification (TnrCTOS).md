# Cloud of Purification (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
You create a billowy white cloud that fills a 20-foot cube anywhere within range. This cloud moves with the prevailing wind and a magical wind quickly disperses it. The cloud is heavier than air and will sink to the ground rather than float away. The cloud lasts for one minute before vanishing, but the effects are permanent.

Filth, garbage, excrement, and small, non-magical vermin such as insects, normal rats and mice, etc., are transformed into an equal quantity of pure water.
