## Description

This pristine book smells faintly of a random scent you find pleasing. When found, the book contains the following spells: [[Antipathy_Sympathy|Antipathy/Sympathy]], [[charm person]], [[dominate person]], [[enthrall]], [[hypnotic pattern]], [[modify memory]], and [[suggestion]] . It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `dice: 1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

- If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the enchantment school.

- When you cast an enchantment spell, you can expend 1 charge to impose disadvantage on the first saving throw one target makes against the spell.
