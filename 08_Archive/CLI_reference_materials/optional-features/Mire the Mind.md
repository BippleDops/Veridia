# Mire the Mind
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 111. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span>*  

**Prerequisite**: Level 5

You can cast [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/slow-xphb|slow]] once using a warlock spell slot. You can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

## Player-Facing Summary

Mire the mind is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of mire the mind as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around mire the mind.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties mire the mind to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at mire the mind to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to mire the mind active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
