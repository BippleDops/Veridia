# Dust of Dryness
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  

This small packet contains `1d6 + 4` pinches of dust. As a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust over water, turning up to a 15-foot [[Cube Area of Effect Xphb]] of water into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible. A creature can take a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so destroys the pellet and ends its magic.

As a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust on an Elemental within 5 feet of yourself that is composed mostly of water (such as a [[water-elemental-xmm (elemental)]] or a [[water-weird-xmm (elemental)]]). Such a creature exposed to a pinch of the dust makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking `10d6` Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
