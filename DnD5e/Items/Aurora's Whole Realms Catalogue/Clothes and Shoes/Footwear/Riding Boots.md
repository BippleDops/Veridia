## Description
The true horsemanâ€™s boot, these come in brown or black, and are constructed from stiffened leather. Standard accessories include a break away strap system for that short sword against your calf, and one dagger or stiletto sheath inside each cuff. A pair of these boots are 7 gp, but well worth the extra investment.
