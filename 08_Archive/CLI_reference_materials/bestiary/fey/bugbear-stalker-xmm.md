*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 62. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

Bugbear stalkers frequently take their victims hostage, relishing opportunities to imprison and terrorize other creatures.

## Bugbears

*Lurking Goblinoid Brutes*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Grassland, Planar (Feywild), Underdark  
- **Treasure.** Armaments, Individual  

Bugbears embody fear of the wilds and the menace of natural places. They're notoriously stealthy, and foes that venture into their territories often vanish without a trace.
