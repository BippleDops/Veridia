# Otto's Irresistible Dance
*6th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the target dances comically until the end of its next turn, during which it must spend all its movement to dance in place.

On a failed save, the target has the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] condition for the duration. While [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]], the target dances comically, must use all its movement to dance in place, and has [[disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls, and other creatures have [[advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on attack rolls against it. On each of its turns, the target can take an action to collect itself and repeat the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

**Classes**: [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]; [[list-spells-classes-wizard|Wizard]]
