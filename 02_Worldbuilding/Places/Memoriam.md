# Memoriam

*A vast underwater necropolis and memorial site that serves as the final resting place for the honored dead of Aquabyssos and a repository of ancient knowledge.*

## Physical Description & Atmosphere

Memoriam spans across a massive underwater plateau in the [[Twilight Depths]], where the eternal currents of the deep ocean have carved intricate patterns into the seafloor. The memorial site consists of thousands of intricately carved stone monuments, coral grave markers, and crystalline memory matrices that preserve the essence and memories of the departed.

At the center rises the **Eternal Spire**, a towering monument of pure [[Deepstone]] that extends nearly a mile into the water column. Its surface is inscribed with the names of every soul laid to rest here, the text glowing with a soft, reverent light that can be seen from great distances.

The atmosphere is one of profound reverence and melancholy beauty. Schools of bioluminescent fish move in solemn patterns through the memorial gardens, while the [[Keepers of Memory]] tend to the various monuments with quiet dedication. The water itself seems to carry whispers of the past, and sensitive individuals often report hearing fragments of conversations, songs, or final words of the deceased.

## History & Significance

Memoriam was established over two millennia ago following the catastrophic [[War of the Sunless Depths]], when the need for a proper resting place for the fallen became paramount. The site was chosen for its unique properties - the convergence of deep ocean currents creates a natural preservation field that protects both physical remains and spiritual essence.

The memorial expanded during the [[Great Plague of Ages Past]], serving not only as a burial ground but as a quarantine site for those who died from the ancient disease. This historical precedent has made Memoriam crucial in understanding and potentially combating [[The Depth Plague]].

Throughout its existence, Memoriam has served multiple roles:
- Sacred burial ground for nobility and heroes
- Repository of historical knowledge and genealogical records  
- Sanctuary for those seeking spiritual guidance from ancestors
- Research center for necromantic and divination magic
- Neutral ground where even enemies can commune with the dead
