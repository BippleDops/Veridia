--- # Crystal Resoce Transformation Path *Harmonizing with the crystalline frequencies of the deep* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview The Crystal Resoce transformation represents a gradual attunement to the living crystals that grow throughout Aquabyssos. Unlike the violent Crystal Plague, this path involves willing harmonization with crystalline structures, trading flesh for mineral perfection while maintaining consciousness and control. Those who follow this path become living tuning forks for magical energy, their bodies gradually transforming into resot crystal that amplifies and focuses arcane power. The transformation is both beautiful and terribleâ€”creating beings of stunning geometric perfection who have sacrificed their humanity for transcendent power. ## Stage I: Crystal Touched (1-10 TP) *Initial crystalline contamination* ### Acquisition Methods

- Prolonged exposure to crystal caves (1 week)
- Consuming powdered crystal (immediate)
- Being struck by crystal-based magic (cumulative)
- Meditation near resot crystals (gradual) **Reversal Difficulty**: Easy
- Remove from crystal exposure for 1 month
- Dispel Magic cast daily for 1 week
- Consume alchemical purging solution ## Stage II: Crystal Harmonized (11-25 TP) *Deep resoce with crystalline structures* ### Progression Triggers

- Absorb 10,000 gp worth of gems
- Survive being shattered and reformed
- Achieve perfect resoce with a ley line
- Bond with a crystal elemental **Reversal Difficulty**: Moderate
- Requires Greater Restoration
- Must shatter all crystal parts (painful)
- `dice: 2d6` weeks of recovery ## Stage III: Crystal Form (26-50 TP) *Body becomes more crystal than flesh* ### New Abilities

- **Crystal Shard**: Can launch crystal shards (`dice: 2d6` piercing, 30 ft range)
- **Prismatic Burst**: Once per day, explode in rainbow light (`dice: 3d8` radiant)
- **Resot Healing**: Heal other crystal beings by harmonizing **Reversal Difficulty**: Difficult
- Requires Wish or divine intervention
- Must destroy 75% of body
- Consciousness might not survive ## Stage IV: Crystal Sage (51-75 TP) *Transcendent crystalline being* ### Unique Powers

- **Crystal Garden**: Can grow crystal structures from nothing
- **Harmonic Devastation**: Shatter all glass/crystal in 100 feet
- **Prismatic Wall**: Create walls of solid light
- **Frequency Manipulation**: Control sound in 60-foot radius **Reversal Difficulty**: Near Impossible
- Original personality likely destroyed
- Would require reconstructing from memory
- Divine miracle necessary ## Stage V: Crystal Apotheosis (76-100 TP) *Become a living node of crystalline perfection* ### The Final Choice At 100 TP, the character faces the ultimate decision:

1. **Merge with the Crystal Overmind**: Become part of the universal crystal consciousness
2. **Shatter into Seeds**: Explode into thousands of crystals to spread across reality
3. **Become a Crystal Star**: Transform into a celestial body of pure crystal
4. **Create Crystal Paradise**: Transform a region into a crystalline utopia **Reversal**: Impossible

- The original being no longer exists
- Only echoes remain in the crystal song
- Destruction would require unmaking concepts ## See Also

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Crystal Resoc as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Crystal Resoc. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
