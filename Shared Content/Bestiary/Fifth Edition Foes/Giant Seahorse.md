## Description
Giant seahorses are larger versions of the common seahorse that spend their days swimming slowly while dining on crustaceans and other small, aquatic life. The average giant seahorse is about eight feet long and weighs 300 pounds.

Giant seahorses reproduce four times a year through internal fertilization. During reproduction, the female giant seahorse lays between 300 and 700 eggs in the male’s incubation pouch (which resembles the pouch of a kangaroo). After 20 days, the eggs hatch, and the young remain in the pouch until they are capable of swimming on their own (about ten days). Newborn giant seahorses are about 1-foot long and reach maturity in 8 months. Giant seahorses are monogamous and mate for life.

A giant seahorse’s body is covered in fine scales. It’s head has a long snout that gives it an eerie resemblance to a horse. Its back is lined with small dorsal fins. Giant seahorses range in color from yellow to dull green to brown. Their eyes are almost always brown; the rare seahorse with blue eyes is prized by mermen, tritons, and other underwater races.

Giant seahorses are not aggressive. They attack only if cornered or if a member of the herd is threatened. In combat, a giant seahorse slaps an opponent with its powerful tail or occasionally butts with its bony head. Most simply flee when confronted.

## Training a Giant Seahorse
A giant seahorse requires training before it can bear a rider, and even more training before it can serve as a mount in combat. Creatures who train giant seahorses (mermen and tritons, mainly) like to start with a seahorse that shows curiosity about other creatures rather than fear. Training a seahorse as an aquatic mount takes six weeks of work followed by a successful DC 20 Wis (Animal Handling) check. Riding a seahorse calls for an exotic saddle.

Seahorse eggs are worth 500 gp apiece on the animal market, while young are worth 800 gp each. Professional trainers charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a giant seahorse.
