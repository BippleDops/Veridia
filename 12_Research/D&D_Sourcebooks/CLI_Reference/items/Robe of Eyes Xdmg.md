# Robe of Eyes
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/robe-of-eyes.webp#right)

This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits:

- **All-Around Vision.** The robe gives you [[Advantage Xphb]] on Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.  
- **Special Senses.** You have [[senses#Darkvision|Darkvision]] and [[senses#Truesight|Truesight]], both with a range of 120 feet.

## Drawbacks

A [[Fount of Moonlight Xphb]] spell cast on the robe or a [[Light Xphb]] spell cast within 5 feet of the robe gives you the [[conditions#Blinded|Blinded]] condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for Light or DC 15 for Daylight), ending the condition on yourself on a success.
