## Speaking Style
*"The forge teaches patience - metal shaped too quickly breaks under pressure. So too with the soul."*

*"I have walked through fire, both literal and spiritual. What flames do you carry that you fear to face?"*

*"Strength without discipline is destruction. Discipline without compassion is cruelty. Balance all things."*

*"Brother, we are all scarred metal. The question is whether we let those scars make us brittle or stronger."*

- **Sacred Texts**: Advanced treatises on crystal-fire harmony
- **Healing Potion** (2): For emergencies and teaching first aid

## Teaching Philosophy
Marcus believes that true strength comes from discipline, not power. He teaches that every person contains an inner flame that can either create or destroy, depending on how it's channeled. His students learn:

- **Control before power**: Master basics before attempting advanced techniques
- **Compassion in combat**: Even enemies deserve the chance for redemption
- **Sacred duty**: Protecting others is more important than personal advancement
- **Balance in all things**: Extremism in any direction leads to corruption
