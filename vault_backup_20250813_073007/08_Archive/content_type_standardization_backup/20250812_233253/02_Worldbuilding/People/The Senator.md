# The Senator
*The People's Voice, The Progressive Champion, The Unwitting Pawn*

## Overview
Senator Cordelia Valerius is one of Aquabyssos' most beloved and respected parliamentary leaders, known for her passionate advocacy for citizen rights, progressive social policies, and unwavering moral stance against corruption. What neither she nor her constituents realize is that she has been partially shadow-replaced over the past two years, with key aspects of her personality and decision-making subtly altered to serve shadow interests. She genuinely believes she's fighting for justice while unknowingly advancing the shadow agenda through seemingly beneficial legislation.
