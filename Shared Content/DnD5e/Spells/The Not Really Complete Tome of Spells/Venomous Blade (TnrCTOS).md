# Venomous Blade (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a drop of poison)

**Duration**: Special


## Effects
You magically cover one bladed weapon or three projectile or thrown weapons with a deadly contact poison. This poison remains effective for three successful strikes on a blade, or for one use each on a missile.

Each blow inflicts an additional 2d6 poison damage, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a 3rd-level or higher spell slot, you may use the blade for one additional strike, or poison one additional missile, for each slot level above 2nd.
