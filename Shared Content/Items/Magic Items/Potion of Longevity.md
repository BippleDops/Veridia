# Potion of Longevity

## Overview
**Type**: Magic Item

**Group**: *Potions*

**Rarity**: *Very Rare*

## Description
When you drink this potion, your physical age is reduced by `dice: 1d6+6` (1d6+6) years, to a minimum of 13 years. Each time you subsequently drink a potion of longevity, there is 10 percent cumulative chance that you instead age by `dice: 1d6+6` (1d6+6)  years. Suspended in this amber liquid are a scorpion's tail, an adder's fang, a dead spider, and a tiny heart that, against all reason, is still beating. These ingredients vanish when the potion is opened.
