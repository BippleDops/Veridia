Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Deep Mining Operations as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Deep Mining Operations. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Secret Pact - Summon ancient evil ## Plot Hooks - A shipment has gone missing and truth emerges
