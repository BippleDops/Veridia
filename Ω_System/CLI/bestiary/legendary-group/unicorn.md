# Unicorn

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual_

Transformed by the creature's celestial presence, the domain of a unicorn might include any of the following magical effects:

- Open flames of a non magical nature are extinguished within the unicorn's domain. Torches and campfires refuse to burn, but closed lanterns are unaffected.  
- Creatures native to the unicorn's domain have an easier time hiding; they have advantage on all Dexterity ([Stealth](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide.  
- When a good-aligned creature casts a spell or uses a magical effect that causes another good-aligned creature to regain hit points, the target regains the maximum number of hit points possible for the spell or effect.  
- Curses affecting any good-aligned creature are suppressed.  

If the unicorn dies, these effects end immediately.
