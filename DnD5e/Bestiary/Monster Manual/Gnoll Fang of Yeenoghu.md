## Special Traits
***Rampage.*** When the gnoll reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, the gnoll can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The gnoll makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d6+3`) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (`dice: 2d6`) poison damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d8+3`) slashing damage.

## Description
Gnolls celebrate their victories by performing demonic rituals and making blood offerings to Yeenoghu.

Sometimes the demon lord rewards his worshipers by allowing one of them to be possessed by a demonic spirit. Marked as Yeenoghu's favorite, the lucky recipient becomes a fang of Yeenoghu, the chosen of the Gnoll Lord. In much the same way Yeenoghu created the first gnolls, a [[Hyena|hyena]] that feasts on a fang's slain foe undergoes a horrible transformation, becoming a full-grown adult gnoll. Depending on the number of [[Hyena|hyenas]] in a region, a fang of Yeenoghu can lead to a startling increase in the gnoll population. Finding and killing the fang is the only way to keep that population in check.
