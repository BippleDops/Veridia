## Description
If farmers have any true enemy, it is fire—which can steal not only one’s livelihood, but also one’s life. Though scythes can cut a firebreak to save a field, this billhook can remove thatch from a roof to save a home. A pole, once assembled, lets you raise this hook 15 feet to the crown of a roof to pull loose the thatch before the fire reaches it. The sharp and barbed tip makes this weapon also effective against vermin who make their homes in many thatched roofs.
