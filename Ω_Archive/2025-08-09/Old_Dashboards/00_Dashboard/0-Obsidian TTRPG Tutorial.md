# Obsidian TTRPG Vault Tutorial

This vault is designed as a foundation for people wanting some help on their Obsidian journey.

## Content

This vault does not contain content. It does however contain instructions to obtain the content. The notes contained often contain hidden comments. If you open the note in Source mode you will find the comments between the `%%` and `%%`.

## Templates

I use templates for more than just note templates. I create a lot of `note component` templates. By this I mean templates for things that go in a note. For example I don't know/remember how to make a [Callout Box](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts). Instead I press `Alt+T` and type `callout` and pick the one I like.

There are two different ways to trigger a Template.
- **Insert Default Template** - `Alt+T` - I primarily use these.
- **Insert Templater Template** - `Alt+E` - This is used to trigger advanced templates.

> [!NOTE] Note
> You don't need templates for Callouts anymore. Simply right click in a note and select `ÃŒnsert > Callout`. From there you can right click the callout title to change the type of callout.

## Common Questions

> [!question] How To Open Folders?
> This vault has Folder Notes installed. This allows a folder to be used as a note which is really useful for structuring your content. It does mean though that clicking on a folder that contains a folder note will open the note instead of expanding the folder. The trick is to click to the left of the folder instead.
> **Note:** *You can create a new folder note by Ctrl + Clicking a folder.*
