## Description
How fitting that the sweetest of nectars comes from insects with the most savage sting. But only bears wage war on natural hivesâ€” intelligent races raise bees like they do cattle. We offer a beehive shaped like a large egg with nesting eggs within. Each section is circumscribed around the center to allow the top to be removed for quick access. The hive (10 gp) comes with an [[Incense|incense]] can whose smoke helps makes the creatures docile. We also supply a hat with silk netting for an additional 4 gp.

## Additional Details
once occupied by bees, produces 10 lb of honey per summer month; Dex check needed to harvest without sting; if failed, loses 1 hp for every round within 100 yd
