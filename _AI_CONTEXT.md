# Essential Context for AI Assistants
*Critical information about campaign tone, themes, and conventions*

## üé≠ World Tone & Themes

### Dark Fantasy with Moral Ambiguity
This is not a heroic fantasy where good triumphs over evil. This is a world where:
- **No perfect solutions exist** - Every choice has terrible consequences
- **Heroes make impossible choices** - Save many or save few, never everyone
- **Victory has a price** - Success always demands sacrifice
- **Evil has reasons** - Villains believe they're saving the world
- **Good can be cruel** - The righteous cause immense suffering

### Body Horror and Transformation
Physical change as existential dread:
- **Crystal corruption** - Beautiful but horrifying transformation
- **Depth adaptation** - Losing humanity to survive
- **Shadow separation** - Your shadow acts against you
- **Memory dissolution** - Forgetting who you were
- **Identity death** - Becoming something else entirely

### Political Intrigue Over Direct Combat
Combat is a failure of negotiation:
- **Information is power** - Knowledge more valuable than gold
- **Everyone has leverage** - Even the weakest hold secrets
- **Alliances shift constantly** - Today's friend, tomorrow's enemy
- **Public face vs private agenda** - No one shows their true self
- **Reputation matters** - Actions have social consequences

## üéÆ Campaign Style

### Players Face Impossible Choices
Present dilemmas with no good answer:
- **Save the Queen or save the city** - Not both
- **Preserve humanity or gain power** - Transformation tempts
- **Truth that destroys or lies that save** - Information kills
- **Individual vs collective** - One life or many
- **Known evil vs unknown chaos** - Devil you know

### NPCs Have Independent Agendas
The world doesn't revolve around the party:
- **NPCs act offscreen** - Things happen without players
- **Time continues during rests** - The world doesn't pause
- **Relationships evolve** - NPCs' opinions change
- **Plans proceed regardless** - Villains don't wait
- **Help has a price** - NPCs want something in return

### Time Pressure Is Constant
The clock is always ticking:
- **Crystal Festival countdown** - 4 weeks and closing
- **Plague spreading** - New victims daily
- **Queen deteriorating** - Possession accelerating
- **Factions mobilizing** - War preparations advance
- **Dimensions converging** - Reality breaking down

### Consequences Cascade Across Sessions
Actions have long-term ramifications:
- **Session 1 choices affect Session 10** - No reset button
- **Dead NPCs stay dead** - Usually (undeath exists)
- **Destroyed locations remain destroyed** - Permanent change
- **Reputation follows the party** - Fame and infamy
- **Transformations are permanent** - No easy cures

## üéØ Important Conventions

### Death Is Not Always Permanent
But resurrection has complications:
- **Shadows can survive body death** - Aquabyssos specialty
- **Undeath is common** - But changes personality
- **Crystal preservation** - Frozen between life and death
- **Memory resurrection** - Rebuild from memories
- **Always a cost** - What returns is changed

### Reality Is Malleable
Especially in Aquabyssos:
- **Memory shapes reality** - Collective belief manifests
- **Time flows differently** - Depth affects chronology
- **Dimensions overlap** - Same space, different reality
- **Dreams have power** - Nightmares manifest physically
- **Identity is fluid** - You can become someone else

### Memory Can Be Weaponized
Information warfare at its peak:
- **Stolen memories** - Take someone's experiences
- **False memories** - Implant experiences
- **Memory bombs** - Traumatic reveals
- **Collective amnesia** - Erase events from history
- **Memory trading** - Experiences as currency

### Identity Is Fluid
What makes you "you"?:
- **Shadow selves** - Independent aspects
- **Body swapping** - Consciousness transfer
- **Reflection replacement** - Mirror versions
- **Possession** - Multiple souls per body
- **Transformation** - Become something else

## üåç Cross-World Mechanics

### How Travel Between Worlds Works
Not simple teleportation:
- **Dimensional frequency** - Must match vibration
- **Anchor points needed** - Specific locations only
- **Physical transformation** - Body adapts to new realm
- **Mental strain** - Sanity checks required
- **Time distortion** - Different flow rates

### What Changes When Moving Between Realms
Fundamental rules shift:
- **Aethermoor**: Surface logic, crystal corruption
- **Aquabyssos**: Underwater logic, pressure adaptation
- **Convergence zones**: Mixed rules, unstable
- **Magic functions differently** - Spells may fail/change
- **Physics varies** - Gravity, time, space flex

### Universal Constants Across Both Worlds
Some things never change:
- **The Seven Shards** - Exist in all realities
- **Primordial entities** - Beyond dimensional limits
- **Soul continuity** - Same soul, different aspects
- **Emotional resonance** - Feelings transcend realms
- **The Deep Mother** - Sleeps between all worlds

## üìù Writing Style Guidelines

### When Describing Scenes
- **Focus on sensory details** - What they smell, feel, hear
- **Emphasize the uncanny** - Something feels "wrong"
- **Layer multiple threats** - Physical, social, existential
- **Include background action** - World continues around them
- **End with questions** - Not statements

### When Roleplaying NPCs
- **Everyone has secrets** - Never reveal everything
- **Mix truth with lies** - Even allies mislead
- **Show stress and fear** - NPCs feel the pressure
- **Reference offscreen events** - "Did you hear about..."
- **Interrupt conversations** - Urgent events intrude

### When Presenting Choices
- **No option is clearly good** - All have downsides
- **Time pressure prevents analysis** - Decide now
- **Information is incomplete** - Never have all facts
- **Consequences aren't obvious** - Hide long-term effects
- **Someone always suffers** - Make it personal

## üö´ What to Avoid

### Don't Provide Perfect Solutions
- Never offer a way to save everyone
- Avoid deus ex machina rescues
- Don't let cleverness bypass consequences
- Resist player attempts to "game" the system
- No magic items that solve core problems

### Don't Make Morality Simple
- No purely evil villains (except primordials)
- No purely good heroes (including the party)
- Avoid black-and-white choices
- Don't reward "good" behavior consistently
- Question traditional alignment assumptions

### Don't Let Players Feel Safe
- Nowhere is truly secure
- No NPC is completely trustworthy
- Rest doesn't stop the world
- Success brings new problems
- Power has terrible costs

## üé≤ Mechanical Considerations

### Failure Should Be Interesting
- Failed rolls complicate, not stop
- "No, but..." or "Yes, and..."
- Failure reveals information
- Creates new problems to solve
- Advances the story differently

### Resources Should Feel Scarce
- Magic items are rare and dangerous
- Healing is limited and costly
- Information requires sacrifice
- Allies demand reciprocity
- Time is the ultimate resource

### Power Has Visible Costs
- Crystal corruption for magic abuse
- Depth adaptation for survival
- Shadow independence for power
- Memory loss for knowledge
- Humanity loss for strength

## üîÆ Future Plot Seeds

### Always Foreshadow
- Mention Eastern Kingdoms military movement
- Reference other sleeping primordials
- Hint at third world contact
- Suggest time loop possibilities
- Tease ancient pre-catastrophe secrets

### Leave Mysteries Unsolved
- Never explain everything
- Some questions have no answers
- Ancient history stays mysterious
- Primordial motivations unknowable
- Reality's nature stays uncertain

## üìä Session Zero Topics

### Critical Discussions
**Player Comfort Levels**:
- Body horror boundaries
- Transformation acceptance
- Political complexity comfort
- Moral ambiguity tolerance
- Character death possibility

**Expectations Setting**:
- This is not heroic fantasy
- Characters will change/suffer
- No perfect victories exist
- Difficult choices are mandatory

**Safety Tools**:
- Lines and veils established
- X-card or similar system
- Check-ins during intense scenes
