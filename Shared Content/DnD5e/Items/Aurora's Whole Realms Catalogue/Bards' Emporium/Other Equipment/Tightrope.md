## Description
All humans dream of flying, and perhaps those who walk the tightrope come as near to it as anyone. Our tightrope (6 gp) is a banded steel cable that comes with a thick [[Ring|ring]]. By tying one end of the cable to a tree or building and attaching the [[Ring|ring]] near the other end of the cable, the remaining line can be wrapped around another tree and cinched tightly. Thus, our tightrope can be quickly set up in most any location.

## Additional Details
requires Tightrope Walking proficiency; regular falling damage applies
