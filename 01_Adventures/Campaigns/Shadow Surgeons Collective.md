## Overview
The Shadow Surgeons Collective operates in the gray areas between medicine and crime, using shadow magic to perform impossible medical procedures. What began as legitimate trauma treatment using shadow-enhanced surgery has evolved into a sophisticated organization trafficking in stolen memories, shadow-transplanted organs, and psychological warfare conducted through umbral manipulation. They believe that shadows hold the essence of suffering and that by surgically removing these "shadow wounds," they can heal both body and mind - though their methods often create more darkness than they dispel.

### The Shadow Surgery Doctrine
The Collective operates under the belief that all pain, trauma, and disease cast "shadows" within the human body and mind - literal manifestations of suffering that can be surgically removed using shadow magic. Their core tenets include:

- **The Shadow Wound Theory**: Every injury, emotional or physical, creates a corresponding shadow that festers if left untreated
- **Umbral Healing**: True healing requires operating in the shadowfell simultaneously with the material plane
- **Pain as Poison**: Suffering is not character-building but a toxin that corrupts the soul
- **Shadow Transplantation**: Healthy shadows from willing donors can replace diseased ones
- **The Greater Darkness**: Sometimes creating small shadows prevents larger ones from forming

## History and Formation

> [!danger] DM Secret
> The Silhouette Surgeon Prime is actually three different people sharing a single identity through memory synchronization. They take turns being "Prime" and have divided their original personalities among themselves to better run the organization. None of them remembers being a complete individual, and discovering this truth could either destroy the Collective or make them even more dangerous as they seek to become whole again.
