The [[Order of the Drowned Star has developed a horrifying weapon called the "Grief Bomb" - a crystalline device that forces entire populations to experience profound, paralyzing sorrow. Intelligence suggests it's hidden somewhere in the [Abyssos Prime - Inverse Palace (D&D_Statblocks)]], designed to be detonated during a major political gathering to cripple [[Aquabyssos's leadership permanently. ## Background

[High Inquisitor Maltheos]] discovered plans for the Grief Bomb in captured [[Shadow Surgeons Collective documents. The weapon works by amplifying traumatic memories and projecting them into the minds of everyone within a 2-mile radius. Victims become catatonic with grief, reliving their worst losses on an endless loop. ### Phase 1: Gathering Intelligence (1 session)

**Location:** [Harbor District]] **Objective:** Learn about the weapon and its potential hiding places **Key Locations:**
- ****: Contains research on emotional manipulation magic
- **[[Shadow Market Canals|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Shadow Market Canals**: Black market dealers selling "extracted sorrows"
- **[Parliament of Echoes|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Parliament Of Echoes]]**: Infiltrate to access classified reports
- **[[The Deepmind|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Deepmind**: Understanding the psychological impact of memory weapons
- **[Temple District|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Temple District]]**: Religious perspectives on grief and healing **Clues to Find:**

1. **Crystalline Resoce Patterns**: The bomb uses modified [[Seven Shards fragments
2. **Memory Harvesting Equipment**: Strange surgical tools found in raids
3. **Timeline Anomalies**: Temporal distortions around the palace suggest active magic
4. **Emotional Residue**: Psychic investigators detect "grief shadows" in certain areas ### Phase 2: The Palace Infiltration (1-2 sessions)

**Location:** [Abyssos Prime - Inverse Palace (D&D_Statblocks)]] **Objective:** Navigate the twisted architecture to locate the bomb **Challenges:**
- **Inverted Gravity**: Rooms where "down" points in different directions
- **Memory Traps**: Corridors that force characters to relive painful memories
- **Emotion Guards**: Constructs that become stronger when characters feel despair
- **Temporal Loops**: Some rooms repeat the same tragic moment endlessly **Key Areas:**
- **[[Inverted Ballroom Wing - Party Quarters**: Social events provide cover for investigation
- **[garden]]**: Crystalline growths here resonate with the bomb
- **[[Throne Room - Heart of Palace (D&D_References)**: The ultimate target location for the weapon ### Phase 3: The Confrontation (1 session)

**Location:** [The Original Palace]] (accessed through reality tears) **Objective:** Stop [[Anti Priest us from activating the Grief Bomb ## The Grief Bomb

**Appearance:** A 3-foot crystalline sphere covered in carved faces showing expressions of loss **Activation:** Requires a ritual involving the sacrifice of cherished memories **Range:** 2-mile radius of psychic devastation **Duration:** Permanent until dispelled with extreme magical intervention ### Grief Bomb Effects

When activated, all creatures in range must make **DC 20** Wisdom saves or be affected by:
- **Paralyzing Grief**: Incapacitated, can only weep and mourn
- **Memory Amplification**: Traumatic memories feel fresh and overwhelming
- **Emotional Contagion**: The grief spreads to anyone who interacts with victims
- **Despair Aura**: Hope becomes literally impossible to feel ## Defusing the Bomb

**Requirements:**
1. **[Temporal Navigation]] expertise** to access the bomb's temporal core
2. **Memory healing magic** to repair fractured emotional channels
3. **Crystal singing techniques** learned from [[The Singing Trenches
4. **Pure joy essence** harvested from [Memory Farmers]] who cultivate happiness **Skill Challenges:**

--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------

12 (+1) | 15 (+2) | 16 (+3) | 18 (+4) | 24 (+7) | 20 (+5) **Saving Throws** Wis +12, Cha +10 **Skills** Deception +10, Insight +17, Intimidation +15, Religion +14 **Damage Resistances** Psychic, Necrotic **Damage Immunities** Charmed, Frightened **Condition Immunities** Charmed, Frightened **Senses** Truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 17 **Languages** Common, Abyssal, telepathy 120 ft. **Challenge Rating** 11 (7,200 XP) **Proficiency Bonus** +4 ### Special Abilities

**Grief Aura.** All creatures within 30 feet of us have disadvantage on saving throws against fear and charm effects. Additionally, any creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a **DC 19** Wisdom saving throw or be overwhelmed with sorrow, reducing their movement speed by half until the start of their next turn. **Sorrow Empowerment.** us gains power from others' suffering. For each creature within 60 feet that is frightened, charmed, or has been reduced to half hit points or fewer, us gains +1 to attack rolls, damage rolls, and spell save DCs (maximum +5). **Despair Shield.** While any creature within 60 feet is frightened or charmed, us takes half damage from all sources and has advantage on concentration saving throws. **Memory Sight.** us can see the most traumatic memories of any creature he can see, giving him insight into their greatest fears and losses. This grants him advantage on Insight checks and allows him to target specific emotional vulnerabilities. #### Actions

**Multiattack.** us makes two Sorrow Spike attacks or casts two spells of 3rd level or lower. **Sorrow Spike.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +11 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 18 (`dice: 2d10` + 7) psychic damage. The target must make a **DC 19** Wisdom saving throw. On failure, they are stunned until the end of their next turn as they relive their most traumatic memory in vivid detail. **Manifestation of Regret (Recharge 5-6).** us creates illusory manifestations of the party's greatest regrets and losses. Each creature within 60 feet must make a **DC 19** Wisdom saving throw. On failure: 27 (`dice: 6d8`) psychic damage and the creature is frightened for 1 minute (can repeat save at end of each turn). On success: Half damage and not frightened. **Activate Grief Bomb (1/Day).** If us is within 30 feet of the [[02_Worldbuilding, he can spend his action to begin activating it. This requires 3 consecutive rounds of concentration. If successful, the bomb detonates (see Grief Bomb effects). The activation can be interrupted by breaking his concentration or moving him more than 30 feet from the device. **Emotional Vampire (3/Day).** us drains the emotional energy from a creature within 60 feet. The target must make a **DC 19** Charisma saving throw. On failure, the target takes 22 (`dice: 4d10`) necrotic damage and us regains the same amount as hit points. The target's maximum hit points are reduced by half the damage taken. **Final Grief (When reduced to 0 hp).** us triggers a localized grief bomb explosion. All creatures within 30 feet must make a **DC 19** Wisdom saving throw or be affected by intense grief for 24 hours (as per the *confusion* spell, but the creature can only take the "do nothing but weep" action). #### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)

**Move.** us moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
**Sorrow Strike.** us makes one Sorrow Spike attack.
**Cast Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** us casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.
**Empathic Assault (Costs 3 Actions).** us targets one creature within 60 feet with concentrated emotional manipulation. The target must make a **DC 19** Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of their next turn and take 13 (`dice: 3d8`) psychic damage. #### Spellcasting

us is a 14th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save **DC 19**, +11 to hit). He knows the following spells: - **Cantrips (at will):** *guidance*, *resistance*, *thaumaturgy*, *toll the dead*
- **1st level (4 slots):** *bane*, *cause fear*, *inflict wounds* - **2nd level (3 slots):** *detect thoughts*, *hold person*, *suggestion*
- **3rd level (3 slots):** *bestow curse*, *fear*, *speak with dead*
- **4th level (3 slots):** *confusion*, *locate creature*, *polymorph*
- **5th level (3 slots):** *dominate person*, *modify memory*, *scrying*
- **6th level (1 slot):** *harm*, *mass suggestion*
- **7th level (1 slot):** *plane shift*, *reverse gravity* #### Equipment

- **Robes of Eternal Sorrow**: AS 17, grants immunity to fear and charm while attuned
- **Staff of Memory Drain**: +2 spellcasting focus that can store extracted memories
- **[02_Worldbuilding]] Activation Crystal**: Allows remote activation of the device
- **Vial of Concentrated Despair**: Can be thrown to create a 20-foot radius area of magical despair
- **Memory Extraction Tools**: Surgical implements for harvesting traumatic experiences **Tactics:** us focuses on emotional manipulation and psychological warfare rather than direct damage.
