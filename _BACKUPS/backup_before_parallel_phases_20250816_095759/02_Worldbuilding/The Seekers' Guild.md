The Seekers' Guild organizes expeditions to dangerous locations, coordinates treasure hunting operations, and maintains databases of archaeological discoveries. They provide equipment, funding, and logistical support for adventuring parties exploring ancient ruins and dangerous territories. ## Player-Facing Summary The Seekers' Guild is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Seekers' Guild as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Seekers' Guild. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[Campaign_Relationship_Matrix]]
