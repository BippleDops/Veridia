**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a vial of holy water blessed by a senior priest of your faith)

## Effects
You cast this spell and your body shudders and glows with holy (or unholy) radiance as you become a vessel for your god’s power.

While this spell is in effect, you may increase your Strength, Dexterity, *or* Charisma by 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This may increase your attribute above 20. You also gain 15 temporary hit points and +1 to your AC.

When the spell ends and your god’s pres-ence leaves, you gain 3 levels of exhaustion.
