# Dagger of Guitar Solos

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Dagger

**Rarity:** unknown (magic)

**Weight**: 1 lbs.

**Cost:** 75000 cp

**Damage:** 1d4 piercing

## Description

This drow-made dagger is decorated with silver web filigree. It magically plays a fragment of a guitar solo when struck or used to strike a foe.

**Finesse**. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**Light.** A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.

**Thrown.** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.
