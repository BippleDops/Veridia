## Description
The task of butchering is as distasteful as it is necessary. We offer tools to help speed the work, and minimize the pain for the animal. Our butchering tools include a 20 lb [[Metal|metal]] [[Mallet|mallet]] (8 gp) for dispatching the beast with optimal speed. We also offer a set of 8 hooks (5 gp) for hanging the creature, and a foldable long-razor (7 gp) for draining blood. The other end of the long-razor contains a 6-inch foldable gut-hook that can cut through most any hide without knicking the viscera. Finally, we offer an 8-inch full-bellied skinning knife (5 gp) for the tough but delicate work of skinning a beast.
