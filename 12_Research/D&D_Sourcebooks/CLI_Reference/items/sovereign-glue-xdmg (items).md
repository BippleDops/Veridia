--- # Sovereign Glue

*Wondrous item, legendary* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/sovereign-glue.webp#right) This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with [[oil-of-slipperiness-xdmg (items)]]. When found, a container contains`1d6 + 1`ounces. One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. Applying an ounce of Sovereign Glue takes a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action, and the applied glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of Universal Solvent or [[Oil of Etherealness Xdmg]], or with a [[wish-xphb (spells)]] spell. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 305.
