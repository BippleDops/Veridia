# Extreme Heat
*Environmental Hazard*  

When the temperature is 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, a creature exposed to the extreme heat and without access to drinkable water must succeed on a Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain 1 [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] level. The DC is 5 for the first hour and increases by 1 for each additional hour. Creatures wearing Medium or Heavy armor have [[Advantage Xphb]] on the save. Creatures that have [[boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats)]] or [[immunity-xphb (variant-rules)]] to Fire damage automatically succeed on the save.
