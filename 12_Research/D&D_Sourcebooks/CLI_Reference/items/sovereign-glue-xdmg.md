# Sovereign Glue
*Wondrous item, legendary*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/sovereign-glue.webp#right)


This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/oil-of-slipperiness-xdmg|Oil of Slipperiness]]. When found, a container contains `1d6 + 1` ounces.

One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. Applying an ounce of Sovereign Glue takes a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action, and the applied glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of Universal Solvent or [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/oil-of-etherealness-xdmg|Oil of Etherealness]], or with a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish-xphb|Wish]] spell.
