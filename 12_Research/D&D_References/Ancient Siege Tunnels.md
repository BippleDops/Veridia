# Ancient Siege Tunnels
*The Underground Arteries of Ancient Warfare*

## Overview

Beneath the major cities of [[Aethermoor|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] lies a vast network of ancient siege tunnels, testament to the brutal military engineering of the [[Continental War|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/Continental War]]. These massive underground passages once carried armies, siege engines, and supplies directly beneath enemy fortifications, allowing for devastating surprise attacks that changed the course of history.

Built primarily during the Third Continental War by the allied forces of what would become [[Port Meridian|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]], [[Crystalhaven|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven]], and [[Ironhold|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Ironhold]], these tunnels represent some of the most ambitious military engineering projects ever undertaken. Though many sections have collapsed or been deliberately sealed, enough remain active to serve modern purposes - both legitimate and otherwise.

## Historical Context

### The Great Siege Campaign
The tunnel network was conceived during the siege of the ancient fortress-city of Drakmoor, when conventional siege tactics proved inadequate against the city's crystal-enhanced defenses. [[Lord Commander Gareth Steelborn|02 Worldbuilding/People/Lord Commander Gareth Steelborn]]'s engineering corps, working with dwarven miners from [[Ironhold|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Ironhold]] and crystal-mages from [[Crystalhaven|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven]], spent three years excavating the first major tunnel complex.

The success of the Drakmoor operation led to an arms race of underground warfare, with cities across [[Aethermoor|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] both digging new offensive tunnels and counter-mining defensive networks. By the war's end, over 200 miles of tunnels crisscrossed the continent.

### Construction Methods
The ancient engineers employed three distinct tunnel types:

**Crystal-Carved Passages**: [[Crystalhaven|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven]] mages used focused energy beams to melt through solid rock
**Dwarven-Dug Networks**: [[Ironhold|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Ironhold]] miners created structurally superior passages using traditional methods
**Hybrid Constructions**: Combined magical reinforcement with conventional excavation

## Current Tunnel Network

### Major Active Sections

**The Port Meridian Approach**
- 15-mile tunnel connecting to [[Port Meridian - Harbor District|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian Harbor District]]
- Originally designed to bypass coastal defenses
- Now used by [[Thieves Guild|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/Thieves Guild]] and smuggling operations
- Multiple branching passages lead to strategic points throughout the city

**The Crystalhaven Underlayers**
- Complex web of tunnels beneath [[Crystal Gardens|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Crystal Gardens]]
- Many passages still contain active crystal formations
- Used by the [[Merchant's Covenant|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/Merchant's Covenant]] for secure transport
- Connects to the ancient [[Royal Vault|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Royal Vault]] systems

**The Ironhold Deep Roads**
- Most structurally sound section of the entire network
- Reinforced with traditional dwarven engineering techniques
- Actively maintained by [[Ironhold|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Ironhold]] military forces
- Contains hidden weapon caches and emergency supplies

**The Sylvanheart Rootways**
- Unique hybrid tunnels that incorporated living tree roots
- Self-maintaining through magical symbiosis
- Guarded by [[Sylvanheart|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Sylvanheart]] druids and rangers
- Provides covert access to multiple forest strongholds

## Game Mechanics (D&D 5e)

### Tunnel Navigation
**Intelligence (Investigation) DC 16**: Navigate without getting lost
**Wisdom (Survival) DC 14**: Find safe camping spots and avoid unstable areas
**Strength (Athletics) DC 18**: Traverse collapsed sections

### Environmental Hazards
**Unstable Sections**: Dexterity save DC 15 or trigger partial collapse (2d10 bludgeoning damage)
**Crystal Resonance**: Constitution save DC 16 in magical sections or be stunned for 1 round
**Stagnant Air**: Constitution save DC 12 every hour or gain one level of exhaustion
**Flooding**: Seasonal water levels can trap unwary explorers

### Tunnel Features
- **Echo Chambers**: Sound travels unusually far, allowing eavesdropping but also alerting distant guards
- **Crystal Lights**: Some passages contain permanent magical illumination
- **Secret Passages**: Hidden doors and concealed entrances (DC 20 Investigation to find)
- **Ancient Traps**: Magical and mechanical defenses still function in some areas

## Notable Locations Within

- Guarded by ancient [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Crystal Guard Elite|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Crystal Guard Elite]]
- Repository of military intelligence from the Continental Wars

### The Bone Gardens
*Mass burial chamber for tunnel warfare casualties*
- Restless spirits of ancient soldiers
- Undead guardians protecting buried treasures
- Connection point for multiple tunnel branches
- Source of necromantic energy affecting nearby passages

### The Flooding Gates
*Ancient lock system controlling underground rivers*
- Can flood or drain large sections of tunnels
- Controlled from hidden mechanisms
- Strategic chokepoints for tunnel control
- Connected to [[Port Meridian|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]] sewage systems

### The Arsenal Vaults
*Hidden weapon storage chambers*
- Ancient siege engines stored in preservation chambers
