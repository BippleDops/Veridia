# Abyssos Prime Upper Districts

Grand coral palaces rise from cultivated reef platforms, connected by graceful current-bridges that allow citizens to swim effortlessly between buildings. The architecture here blends the organic curves of sea life with the geometric precision of crystal-enhanced construction.
