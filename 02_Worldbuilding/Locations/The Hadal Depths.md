## Overview
The Hadal Depths represent the absolute bottom of [[Aquabyssos, where water becomes something else entirely and the laws of physics surrender to older truths. Here, at depths exceeding 20,000 feet, the [Deep Mother]] slumbers in her eternal dream, her massive form comprising entire mountain ranges and trenches. This is where existence becomes negotiable, where pressure transforms matter into thought, and where even [[Aboleth Prime Yoth]] fears to venture.
