# Ecosystem Simulation Engine

Simulates food chains, migrations, predator-prey, weather, symbiosis, and extinction/evolution impacting play.

## Food Chains by Zone
- Surface, Twilight, Pressure, Crush, Abyss, Hadal; Sky: Low, Mid, High, Stratos, Orbital
- Each chain provides encounter baselines and resource yields

## Seasonal Migration (50+ species scaffold)
- Define routes on [[Transportation_Infrastructure|Transportation Infrastructure]] networks
- Events: Stampedes, feeding frenzies, spawning grounds

## Predator–Prey Mechanics
- Predation Pressure Score modifies encounter frequency and aggression
- Overhunting collapse → faction/economic consequences (see [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/03_Mechanics/Complete Faction Warfare System]])

## Dynamic Weather Systems
- Use [[Pressure & Weather Events]] to influence behavior and travel DCs

## Symbiosis Networks
- Leverage or disrupt to gain boons or trigger ecological backlash

## Extinction/Evolution Triggers
- Thresholds: Overuse, merger shifts, Deep Mother pulses
- Evolution grants new traits; extinction creates voids filled by horrors

Integration: Affects trade goods, travel safety, and faction stability. Hooks into [[Journey_Event_Compiler|Journey Event Compiler]].

## Player-Facing Summary

Ecosystem Simulation Engine is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Ecosystem Simulation Engine as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Ecosystem Simulation Engine.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Ecosystem Simulation Engine to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at Ecosystem Simulation Engine to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to Ecosystem Simulation Engine active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
