# The Parliament of Nobody
*The Silent Democracy, The Forgotten Assembly, Voices of the Unheard*

## Overview
The Parliament of Nobody represents the ultimate expression of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]'s shadow-touched nature - a governing body where identity itself becomes fluid and representatives speak for those who have been erased, forgotten, or never existed. This phantom legislature meets in the spaces between spaces, making decisions that affect the living world while remaining completely removed from conventional power structures. They are the voice of the voiceless, the representation of the unrepresented, and the democracy of the discarded.

## History

### Foundation in Absence (350 Years Ago)
**The Great Forgetting**
- Formed when [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]] first experimented with memory erasure
- Original members were citizens whose existence was accidentally deleted
- Created as a failsafe to represent those lost to shadow corruption
- Established the principle that "non-existence does not negate citizenship"
- Built their first chamber in a pocket of forgotten space

### The Shadow Constitution (300 Years Ago)
**Rights of the Non-Existent**
- Drafted the [[Charter of Null Rights]] governing those erased from reality
- Established voting procedures for incorporeal citizens
- Created the position of Speaker of Silence to interface with physical world
- Developed the [[Memory Court]] system for adjudicating erasure cases
- Began secret negotiations with [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Parliament of Echoes]]

### Modern Invisibility (Last 150 Years)
**The Persistent Opposition**
- Operates as shadow counterpart to official [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Parliament of Echoes]]
- Represents interests officially ignored by Aquabyssos government
- Maintains complex relationship with [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Shadow Duchess Nyx]]
- Influences policy through supernatural lobbying and reality manipulation
- Coordinates with surface world [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Shadow Conspiracy]]
