    "description": "Emperor Thalassius the Wise has ruled Aquabyssos for over three thousand years, transforming from benevolent king to undead sovereign through a pact with the [[Deep Mother]] herself. Unlike the twisted liches of the surface world, Thalassius maintained his sanity and noble bearing through the transformation, though his flesh has long since given way to translucent, jellyfish-like tissue stretched over ancient bones that gleam with deep-sea phosphorescence.\n\nStanding seven feet tall even in his hunched, eternal posture, Thalassius wears the corroded crown of the first emperor, now fused to his skull through millennia of pressure and magic. His eyes are twin abyssal pearls that glow with an eerie blue-green light, seeing through time itself. Barnacles and coral growths decorate his form like jewelry, and schools of bioluminescent fish swim through his partially translucent body, living symbols of his unity with the ocean depths.\n\nThe emperor rarely leaves the Sunken Throne, a massive chamber at the heart of [[Abyssos Prime   Inverse Palace]], where the water itself bows to his will. Here, surrounded by the fossilized remains of his original court, he contemplates the eternal balance between the depths and the surface, between [[Aquabyssos]] and [[Aethermoor]], between life and undeath.",
