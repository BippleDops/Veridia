# Branching Campaign Paths

20+ routes, cascading consequences, alternate timelines, failure-forward, emergent villains, dynamic prophecy.

## Route Seeds
- Unite the Worlds • Seal Forever • Surrender to the Deep • Ascend to Stars • Memory Utopia • Parasite Dominion • Crystal Theocracy • Pirate Confederacy • Anchor Empire • Dream Sovereignty

## Consequence Cascades
- Each major choice updates Reality Integrity, Faction Pillars, and Sanity Tone

## Failure-Forward
- Failures unlock new arcs rather than dead ends

## Emergent Villains
- Generated from NPC matrix and faction shifts

## Prophecy System
- Mutable prophecies validated by actions; Deep Mother dreams as oracles
