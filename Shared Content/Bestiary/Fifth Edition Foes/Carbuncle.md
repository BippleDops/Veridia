**Discord:** As an attack, a carbuncle can telepathically sow discord in one creature within 30 feet. An affected creature must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or fall into loud bickering and arguing with those around him or her. Meaningful communication is impossible. If creatures of different alignments are affected and bickering, each has a 30% chance that they feel compelled to attack the person they are bickering with who is the most different in alignment. Bickering lasts `dice: 5d4` rounds. Fighting (if it occurs) begins `dice: 1d4` rounds into the bickering and lasts `dice: 2d4` rounds.

## Description
Deep in the tangled underbrush of forests and in the remote regions of dismal swamps and bogs lives a strange creature called the carbuncle. It is a shy creature that seeks to avoid encounters. Should it seek interaction, a carbuncle often begins by proudly announcing the value of the gem in its forehead just to watch the reaction the information arouses.

Despite its shy nature, the carbuncle has a mischievous side as well. It sometimes joins travelers so it can play pranks on them and observe the reactions of the unfortunate victims of its curiosity. After joining with a party, a carbuncle eventually seeks to breed hostility and suspicion between party members. They have been known to telepathically contact nearby monsters and draw them to the party, so that it can watch the battle and read the thoughts of the party under attack before slipping away.

A carbuncle can be coerced to surrender the gem in its forehead with a successful DC 20 Cha (Deception) check. If the attempt fails, the carbuncle sees through the deception and flees. If the carbuncle relinquishes its gem, it grows another one within one month. When a carbuncle is slain, its forehead gem crumbles to dust.

Though fascinated by combat, carbuncles are nearly helpless in melee. They enjoy setting up encounters using their powers and watching the brutal scenes unfold, but they surrender immediately if attacked themselves. In a lethal situation, a carbuncle first tries to bargain for safety with its gem. If that fails, it can will itself to die rather than suffer torment (and rather than giving up its gem to someone it suspects will only kill it anyway).
