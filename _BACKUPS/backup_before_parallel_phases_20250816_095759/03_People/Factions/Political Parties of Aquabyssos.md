## Overview
The Parliament of Echoes operates through a complex multi-party system that has evolved from pre-Drowning political structures. Each party represents different visions for Aquabyssos's future, but all are influenced by the unique challenges of underwater civilization, shadow infiltration, and the ongoing succession crisis.
