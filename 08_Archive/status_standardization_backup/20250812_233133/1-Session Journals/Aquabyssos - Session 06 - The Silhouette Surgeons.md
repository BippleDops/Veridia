# Session 6: The Silhouette Surgeons
## The Nightmare Hospital

> *"We don't perform surgery. We perform identity reassignment."*

## üé¨ Strong Start
The party infiltrates the Surgical Sanctum to find hundreds of bodies suspended in tanks, each being slowly separated from their shadows. One tank contains someone identical to a party member. The Surgeon Prime appears: "Ah, you've found your prototypes. Don't worry‚Äîwe'll reunite you with your true selves soon enough."

## üé≠ Scenes

### Scene 1: The Prototype Ward
**Location**: Sublevel 3 - Duplication Chambers  
**Situation**: Discovery of duplicate party members  
**Conflict**: Duplicates awaken and believe they're the originals  
**Discoveries**:
- Every person in Aquabyssos has a "prototype" made
- Prototypes are shadow-human hybrids
- They have all the original's memories up to creation point
- The duplicates genuinely believe the party are imposters

**Roleplay Crisis**:
- Duplicates know things only PCs would know
- They beg for help, claiming to be trapped
- One duplicate warns about "the real surgeon"
- Marina finds THREE versions of herself

### Scene 2: The Operating Theater
**Location**: Central Surgical Amphitheater  
**Situation**: Witness mass shadow transplant surgery  
**Conflict**: Interrupt procedure without killing patients  
**Discoveries**:
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Silhouette Surgeon Prime]] is actually multiple shadows in one body
- Surgeries are creating agents for continental infiltration
- [[Jasper "Three-Eyes" Flint]] is here‚Äîas a willing surgeon
- The procedures are reversible for exactly 3 hours

**Skill Challenge - Stop the Surgery**:
- **Medicine DC 16**: Safely disconnect patients
- **Sleight of Hand DC 15**: Sabotage equipment
- **Deception DC 17**: Pose as surgical staff
- **Failure**: Patients die or transform immediately

### Scene 3: The Identity Laboratory
**Location**: Research Wing - Consciousness Studies  
**Situation**: Marina confronts her shadow with party present  
**Conflict**: Determine who is the "real" Marina  
**Discoveries**:
- Both Marinas have complete memories
- Shadow Marina has scars the original doesn't
- Original Marina bleeds shadow instead of blood
- They've been switching places repeatedly for years

**The Marina Test**:
- Party must determine who to support
- Each Marina provides evidence
- Wrong choice has campaign consequences
- Truth: They're both "real" in different ways

### Scene 4: The Surgeon's Gambit
**Location**: The Prime Surgeon's Private Lab  
**Situation**: Surgeon offers to make party immune to harvest  
**Conflict**: Procedure requires sacrificing their shadows  
**Discoveries**:
- Surgeon was first successful human-shadow fusion
- The harvest is actually a mass evolution event
- Shadows aren't evil‚Äîthey're trying to survive
- The Deep Mother created shadows as backup humanity

**The Ultimate Choice**:
- **Option A**: Accept fusion (become shadow hybrids)
- **Option B**: Destroy the facility (kill thousands)
- **Option C**: Negotiate coexistence terms
- **Option D**: Steal the research and flee

## üó°Ô∏è Combat Encounters

### Prototype Party Members
- **Stats**: Mirror PC stats but with shadow abilities
- **Shadow Step**: Bonus action teleport 30 ft
- **Identity Crisis**: Can confuse who's who (WIS DC 15)
- **Emotional Plea**: Disadvantage on attacks against them

### Surgical Staff (6)
- **AS** 14, **HP** 38 each
- **Surgical Tools**: 1d6+2 piercing
- **Anesthetic Gas**: CON DC 14 or paralyzed 1 minute
- **Pack Tactics**: Advantage when adjacent

### The Silhouette Surgeon Prime (Phase 2)
- **AS** 18, **HP** 120
- **Legendary Resistance** (3/day)
- **Lair Actions**: Surgical equipment attacks
- **Shadow Multiplication**: Splits into 3 shadows at half HP
- **Identity Theft**: Can copy PC appearance and abilities

## üé≤ Environmental Hazards

### Surgical Sanctum Effects
- **Anesthetic Fog**: CON saves or unconscious
- **Identity Confusion**: WIS saves or forget who you are
- **Shadow Bleed**: Shadows randomly swap between beings
- **Surgical Precision Field**: Crits on 19-20

### The Choice Chamber
Special mechanics for Marina confrontation:
- Zone of Truth effect (no lies possible)
- Memories manifest as visible projections
- Emotional damage for wrong accusations
- Time pressure: 10 rounds before security arrives

## üí∞ Treasure & Rewards
- Surgical Codex (shadow separation techniques)
- 1,200 [[Sorrow Pearls]]
- Shadow Fusion Elixir (3 doses)
- Identity Anchor (prevents shadow swap)
- Map to [[Crystallium]] resonance facility
- Surgeon's Master Key (access all Tenebrarum facilities)

## üîç Secrets & Clues
1. The Surgeon Prime is composed of 12 different shadows
2. [[Jasper "Three-Eyes" Flint]] volunteered to help harvest
3. Every major NPC has a prototype prepared
4. The surgical facilities extend across all continents
5. Shadow evolution is inevitable, not stoppable
6. The [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Parliament of Echoes]] approved the surgeries
7. [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]] has a prototype in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]
8. The Memory Tides are carrying surgical instructions
9. Children adapt to shadow fusion better than adults
10. The real threat isn't shadows‚Äîit's what they're fleeing from

## üîó Campaign Implications

### If Party Accepts Fusion
- Gain shadow abilities
- Become targets of purist factions
- Can communicate with shadows directly
- Lose some humanity (roleplay consequences)

### If Marina's Shadow is Chosen
- Real Marina becomes antagonist
- Shadow Marina provides inside information
- Access to shadow resistance network
- Changes in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] connections

### If Facility is Destroyed
- Thousands die (alignment shift)
- Shadow faction becomes hostile
- Lose access to shadow immunity
- Purist factions support party

## üé™ Cliffhanger Ending
Regardless of choices made, as the party escapes the facility, every shadow in Tenebrarum suddenly points toward [[Crystallium]]. The Surgeon Prime's head (or remains) speaks: "You fools. The resonance has already begun. In three hours, every shadow in Aquabyssos will hear the call. You can't stop the harvest‚Äîyou can only choose whether to guide it or be consumed by it."

Marina (whichever one remains) reveals a final secret: "There's something you need to know about [[Crystallium]]. The entire continent is a transmission tower. And it's not calling to our shadows‚Äîit's calling to something else's. We're not the harvest. We're the bait."

Through the window, the party sees the ocean literally cracking like glass, revealing something massive moving beneath reality itself.
