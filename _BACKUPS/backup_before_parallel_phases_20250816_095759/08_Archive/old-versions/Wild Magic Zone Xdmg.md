--- # Wild Magic Zone

*Environmental Hazard* A past magical disaster or uncontrolled surge of power in a particular place can cause the fabric of magic to unravel, creating a wild magic zone. In such an area, which is typically no more than 300 feet in diameter, magic behaves unpredictably. Whenever a creature expends a spell slot to cast a spell in a wild magic zone, roll`d20`. If you roll a 20 on the die, roll on the [[Wild Magic Surge Xphb table in the "Player's Handbook" to create a magical effect. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 69* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Wild magic zone xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
