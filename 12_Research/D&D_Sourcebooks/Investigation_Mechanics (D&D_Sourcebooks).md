--- # Shadow Conspiracy: Investigation Mechanics

*Complete System for Uncovering the Conspiracy* > [!info] Investigation Framework

> This investigation system combines:
> - Evidence collection and verification
> - NPC interrogation and trust building
> - Shadow detection techniques
> - Timeline pressure and consequences
> - Multiple solution paths ### Evidence Points Tracking The party needs **10 Evidence Points** to publicly expose the conspiracy and gain governmental support.```meta-bind

INPUT[progress Bar(min Value(0), max Value(10)):evidence-points]

LABEL[Evidence Points Collected]```### Evidence Verification Not all evidence is genuine. The conspiracy plants false leads.```dice-roller

dice: 1d20

Evidence Verification Check
1-5: False evidence (lose 1 point if accepted)
6-10: Partial truth (half value)
11-15: Genuine (full value)
16-20: Exceptional quality (+1 bonus point) ### Evidence Chain Requirements Some evidence requires prior discoveries:```mermaid

graph TD A[Voting Anomalies] --> B[Parliament Investigation] B --> C[Shadow Chamber Discovery] C --> D[Full Member List] E[Medical Anomalies] --> F[Surgery Facility] F --> G[Patient Records] G --> H[Victim Identities] I[Ficial Irregularities] --> J[Money Trail] J --> K[Conspiracy Funding] K --> L[Leadership Identity] #### Medical Examination

DC 15 Medicine check reveals:
- Surgical scars at skull base
- Unusual neural activity patterns
- Dual pulse rhythms
- Memory gaps in recent events #### Spell Effectiveness

| Spell | Effect on Shadow-Touched | DC to Resist |
|-------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Detect Evil and Good | Shows as aberration | Auto-success |
| Detect Thoughts | Reveals dual consciousness | DC 18 Wisdom |
| Zone of Truth | Causes system conflict | DC 15 Constitution |
| True Seeing | Shows shadow overlay | Auto-success |
| Identify | Reveals shadow surgery | DC 20 Investigation | #### Custom Detection Ritual

**Shadow Resoce Test** (10 minutes, requires shadow detection kit)
- All shadow-touched within 30 feet must make DC 15 Charisma save
- On failure, shadow aura becomes visible for 1 hour
- On success, they're aware of the detection attempt #### Social Tests

**Memory Verification**: Ask about shared past experiences
**Emotional Response**: Shadow-touched have limited emotional range
**Personal Habits**: Original personality quirks are absent
**Decision Patterns**: Always choose options benefiting conspiracy ### Shadow Detection Kit

*Rare adventuring gear, 500 gp* **Contents**:
- Specialized mirror (shows true reflection)
- Temperature-sensitive crystals
- Memory verification questions
- Behavioral pattern guide
- Evidence collection tools **Use**: Advantage on Investigation checks related to shadow detection ### Consciousness Scanner

*Very rare wondrous item* **Properties**:
- 3 charges, regains 1d3 at dawn
- **Scan (1 charge)**: Detect shadow-touched within 30 feet
- **Deep Scan (2 charges)**: Reveal specific shadow modifications
- **Purge (3 charges)**: Attempt to remove shadow control (DC 18 Wisdom save) ### Memory Archive Crystal

*Rare wondrous item* **Properties**:
- Stores up to 10 memories for comparison
- Compare memories between individuals
- Detect altered or implanted memories
- Preserve evidence of consciousness manipulation ### Trust Building Mechanics INPUT[slider(min Value(-10), max Value(10)):npc-trust]

LABEL[NPC Trust Level] #### Soft Approach (Persuasion)

- Build rapport over multiple conversations
- Share information to gain trust
- Appeal to moral conscience
- Offer protection or rewards dice: 1d20+CHA

Soft Interrogation

DC = 15 - (Trust Level) #### Hard Approach (Intimidation)

- Immediate results but damages trust
- May trigger shadow defensive protocols
- Can cause witnesses to flee
- Sometimes necessary for time pressure dice: 1d20+STR/CHA

Hard Interrogation

DC = 20 - (Fear Level) #### Analytical Approach (Investigation)

- Catch inconsistencies in stories
- Cross-reference with evidence
- Build logical case
- Expose lies through facts dice: 1d20+INT

Analytical Interrogation

DC = 18 - (Evidence Points/2) ### Information Extraction Table`dice: 1d12`| d12 | Information Gained | Trust Required |
