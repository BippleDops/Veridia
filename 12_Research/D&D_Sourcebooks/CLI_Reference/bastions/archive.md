## Research: Helpful Lore

When you issue the "Research" order to this facility, you commission the facility's hireling to search the Archive for helpful lore. The work takes 7 days. The hireling gains knowledge as if they had cast the [[legend-lore-xphb|Legend Lore]] spell, then shares this knowledge with you the next time you speak with them.

## Reference Book

Your Archive contains one copy of a rare and valuable reference book, which gives you a benefit while you and the book are in your Bastion. You can choose one of the following options (your DM might make more options available):

- **Bigby's Handy Arcana Codex.** You have Advantage on any Intelligence ([[skills#Arcana|Arcana]]) check you make when you take the [[actions#Study|Study]] action to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, and planes of existence.  
- **The Chronepsis Chronicles.** You have Advantage on any Intelligence ([[skills#History|History]]) check you make when you take the Study action to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, wars, and lost civilizations.  
- **Investigations of the Inquisitive.** You have Advantage on any Intelligence ([[skills#Investigation|Investigation]]) check you make when you take the Study action to make deductions based on clues or evidence or to recall lore about traps, ciphers, riddles, and gadgetry.  
- **Material Musings on the Nature of the World.** You have Advantage on any Intelligence ([[skills#Nature|Nature]]) check you make when you take the Study action to recall lore about terrain, plants, animals, and the weather.  
- **The Old Faith and Other Religions.** You have Advantage on any Intelligence ([[skills#Religion|Religion]]) check you make when you take the Study action to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.  

## Enlarging the Facility

You can enlarge your Archive to a Vast facility by spending 2,000 GP. If you do so, you gain two additional reference books chosen from the list above.

## Player-Facing Summary

Archive is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of archive as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around archive.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
