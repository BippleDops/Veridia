# Sickening Radiance
*4th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Dim, greenish light spreads within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The light spreads around corners, and it lasts until the spell ends.

When a creature moves into the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take `4d10` radiant damage, and it suffers one level of [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Exhaustion|exhaustion]] and emits a dim, greenish light in a 5-foot radius. This light makes it impossible for the creature to benefit from being [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Invisible|invisible]]. The light and any levels of [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Exhaustion|exhaustion]] caused by this spell go away when the spell ends.
