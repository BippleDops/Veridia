--- # Contingency

*6th-level, Abjuration* - **Casting time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gem-encrusted statuette of yourself worth 1,500+ GP)
- **Duration:** 10 days Choose a spell of level 5 or lower that you can cast, that has a casting time of an action, and that can target you. You cast that spellâ€”called the contingent spellâ€”as part of casting Contingency, expending spell slots for both, but the contingent spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it takes effect when a certain trigger occurs. You describe that trigger when you cast the two spells. For example, a Contingency cast with [[Water Breathing Xphb]] might stipulate that Water Breathing comes into effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid. The contingent spell takes effect immediately after the trigger occurs for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then Contingency ends. The contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can normally target others. You can use only one Contingency spell at a time. If you cast this spell again, the effect of another Contingency spell on you ends. Also, Contingency ends on you if its material component is ever not on your person. **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 256.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of contingency xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around contingency xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A letter reveals ancient history about this place
