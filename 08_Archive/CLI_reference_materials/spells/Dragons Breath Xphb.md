# Dragon's Breath
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a hot pepper)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch one willing creature, and choose Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison. Until the spell ends, the target can take a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to exhale a 15-foot [Cone](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb.md). Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `3d6` damage of the chosen type on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d6` for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes**: [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard (College of Lore)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Sorcerer (Draconic Sorcery)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-draconic-sorcery-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
