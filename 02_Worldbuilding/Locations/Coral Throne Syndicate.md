## Physical Description & Atmosphere

The Coral Throne Syndicate operates from a sprawling underwater complex built within a massive natural coral formation in the [[Crimson Reef]]. The structure appears to be a legitimate coral research facility from the outside, complete with cultivation pools and marine biology equipment - the perfect front for their illegal operations.

The true headquarters lies deeper within the reef, accessible only through hidden passages known to syndicate members. Bioluminescent coral provides ambient lighting while maintaining the facility's secretive atmosphere. The centerpiece is the titular Coral Throne - a magnificent seat carved from a single massive [[Blood Coral]] specimen, worth more than most kingdoms' treasuries.

Armed guards patrol the facility's corridors, all bearing the syndicate's mark: a stylized coral crown tattoo visible only under specific magical light frequencies. The atmosphere is one of barely contained violence masked by the veneer of legitimate business.

## History & Significance

Founded thirty years ago by the enigmatic [[Coral Empress Scarletina]], the syndicate began as a small-time smuggling operation moving rare coral specimens to collectors in the surface world. As demand grew, so did their ambition and brutality.

The organization gained true power during the [[Plague Crisis]] when they cornered the market on healing coral and other medicinal sea plants. Their willingness to exploit desperate communities during the [[Depth Plague]] outbreaks cemented their reputation as utterly ruthless.

The syndicate's influence now extends throughout [[Aquabyssos]], with operations in every major settlement. They maintain uneasy truces with legitimate authorities through a combination of bribery, blackmail, and strategic elimination of threats.
