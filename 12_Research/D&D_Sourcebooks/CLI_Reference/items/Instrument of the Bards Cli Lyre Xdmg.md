# Instrument of the Bards, Cli Lyre
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/cli-lyre.webp#right)

An Instrument of the Bards is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `2d4` Psychic damage.

You can play the Cli [[Lyre Xphb]] to cast one of the following spells: [[fly-xphb (spells)]], [[see-invisibility-xphb (spells)]], [[levitate-xphb (spells)]], [[Protection From Evil and Good Xphb]], [[stone-shape-xphb (spells)]], [[wall-of-fire-xphb (spells)]], and [[Wind Wall Xphb]]. Once the Cli [[Lyre Xphb]] has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
