## Description
Found in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be [[Dust of Disappearance|dust of disappearance]], and an **[[Identify|Identify]]** spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15 [[Constitution|Constitution]] saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is [[Incapacitated|incapacitated]] and [[9 - The Environment|suffocating]]. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The **[[Lesser Restoration|lesser restoration]]** spell can also end the effect on a creature.
