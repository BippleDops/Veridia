## Overview
### Night-Slug Burglar
![[skflt4y3.2ph.png|Night-Slug Burglar|300]]
[[skflt4y3.2ph.png|open outside]]

*The creature is roughly the size of a halfling. Its skin is a blotchy gray color with a few sporadic tufts of muddy-brown hair. The scraps of ragged clothes it wears are covered in filth, clearly not having been washed in weeks — if ever. Its arms are thin and elongated, hanging almost limp.*

**Alignment**: Neutral

**Armor Class**: 14

**Hit Points**: 11 (`dice: 2d6 + 4`)

**Speed**: 25 ft., crawl 20 ft.

**Senses**: Darkvision 60 ft.

## Special Traits
**Compression:** The night-slug can move through spaces one size category smaller than itself without squeezing, and it can squeeze through openings two size categories smaller.

**Slime Coat:** Other creatures have tactical disadvantage when trying to grapple a night-slug, and the night-slug has tactical advantage on attempts to escape from grapples. Survival checks to follow a night-slug’s trail across any type of terrain are made with tactical advantage.

**Sly Crawler:** Crawling doesn’t slow down a night-slug, even in difficult terrain. A crawling night-slug doesn’t trigger opportunity attacks for movement.

**Sneak Atttack:** A night-slug burglar’s dagger attack does an extra `dice: 1d6` piercing damage if the night-slug has tactical advantage on the attack or if another night-slug is within 5 feet of the target and able to attack.

**Thief:** The night-slug burglar has proficiency with thief’s tools and is never without them.

## Actions
**Melee Attack—Dagger:** +6 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d4 + 4` piercing damage.

**Ranged Attack—Dagger:** +6 to hit (range 20 ft./60 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d4 + 4` piercing damage.

## Description
**Environment**: Urban

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, or gang (3–6)

None are as naturally capable of the fine art of breaking and entering as the night-slug. Fortunately for society, few are also as cowardly. Night-slugs maintain their existence simply by avoiding notice. They often reside in small crawlspaces or even the hollows between the outer masonry and inner plaster and lathe of a house. Those who are not lucky enough to acquire such grand accommodations typically live in places that allow them to avoid notice — the city dump, a gable hanging over a small alleyway, and so forth.

Night-slugs are capable of maneuvering their bodies through seemingly impossible spaces. Their ligaments and tendons are exceptionally elastic, allowing a night-slug to elongate its arms and legs, and in the process pulling what muscle it has closer to its frame. In addition, night-slugs have a “collapsible” skeleton; its bones are composed primarily of cartilage, allowing the creature to squeeze into incredibly small areas.

A typical night-slug stands around 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs 40 pounds.

Night-Slug Society Night-slugs are scavengers living on the fringes of other societies. They prefer densely populated urban areas for the increased number of hiding places and resources from which to scrounge their needs. Most night-slugs are loners because of the limited resources available to them; mated couples rarely stay together beyond the birth of a brood of whimps (as their young are called), and mothers generally abandon their young as soon as they reach maturity after 3 years.

While most humanoids despise night-slugs and find their presence loathsome, few actually fear the creatures. More than one urban goodwife has walked into a room of her house at night to find a night-slug crouched in the corner chewing on a lace table runner and staining the rug with its noxious skin secretions. While the typical reaction certainly includes a scream, rather than flight it just as often concludes with her grabbing a broom and chasing the creature until it manages to squeeze back through a crack in the baseboards to the safety of the inner walls. In some cities plagued by these creatures, there is an entire industry for exterminators hired to enter homes and buildings to clear out night-slug infestations.

Unlike their skulk cousins, who possess a more violent bent, night-slugs are inherently cowardly and rarely a threat to even those who would otherwise find themselves at their mercy. There are examples, however, of individuals who have overcome this innate fearfulness and gone on to become highly proficient thieves and even assassins, in some cases.
