## Description
Any horseman will tell you that the difference between a good bit and bridle and a poor one is a stiff neck, an aching back, and a bad temper. Our horse bridles work well both for long journeys and for high-speed chases. This bridle has double checks, a quirt-length end, a padded crown piece and doubled chafe. Without bit: 13 sp; with bit: 15 sp; blinder bridle and bit: 2 gp.
