# Horseshoes of a Zephyr

## Overview
**Type**: Magic Item

**Group**: *Wondrous item*

**Rarity**: *Very Rare*


## Description
These iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores [[13 - Movement and Position|difficult terrain]]. In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering [[Exhaustion|exhaustion]] from a forced march.
