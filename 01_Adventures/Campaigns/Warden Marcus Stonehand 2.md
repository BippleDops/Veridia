# Warden Marcus Stonehand

*"Justice without mercy is tyranny, mercy without justice is chaos. In these depths, I maintain the balance that keeps civilization from drowning in its own darkness."*

## Overview

Warden Marcus Stonehand oversees Aquabyssos's primary detention facility, known as the Pressure Depths, where the city's most dangerous criminals are held in specially designed underwater cells. A former military officer who transitioned to corrections work after a career-ending injury, Marcus has spent fifteen years developing innovative approaches to underwater incarceration and prisoner rehabilitation.

Stonehand earned his nickname both for his unyielding adherence to protocol and for his prosthetic left hand, replaced with an enchanted stone construct after losing it in a prison riot early in his tenure. His facility has become a model for other underwater realms, combining security with humane treatment and successful rehabilitation programs.

As political tensions rise in Aquabyssos, Marcus faces increasing pressure from various factions wanting access to prisoners or demanding special treatment for their captured members.

## Appearance

Marcus is a weathered human in his late forties, with graying hair kept in a military-style cut and alert brown eyes that constantly assess situations for potential security threats. His left hand is a masterwork of stone and metal craftsmanship, articulated with magical mechanisms that make it as functional as flesh.

He wears a modified warden's uniform designed for underwater environments, with reinforced materials and pressure-resistant components. His bearing reflects his military background - straight posture, precise movements, and an authoritative presence that commands respect from both staff and prisoners.

## Personality
- Absolutely committed to fair treatment of all prisoners regardless of their crimes or connections
- Believes strongly in the possibility of rehabilitation and redemption
- Maintains strict discipline while showing genuine care for those under his authority
- Refuses to be influenced by political pressure or factional interests

## Background

Marcus served as a military police officer for twelve years before transferring to civilian corrections work. His military experience with discipline and order made him a natural fit for warden duties, while his personal code of honor ensured fair treatment for all prisoners.

The loss of his left hand during his second year as warden - sacrificed to save a guard during a prison riot - became a defining moment. His decision to continue his duties with a prosthetic demonstrated his dedication and earned the loyalty of his staff.

Under his leadership, the Pressure Depths has achieved the lowest recidivism rate of any correctional facility in the underwater realms, thanks to Marcus's innovative rehabilitation programs.

## Current Activities

Marcus is dealing with increased pressure from various factions wanting special treatment for their imprisoned members or access to prisoners for interrogation. He's maintaining his strict neutrality while preparing for the possibility that political conflicts might affect prison security.

He's also investigating reports of attempts to communicate with high-security prisoners and evidence that some inmates may have connections to the broader conspiracy affecting the city.

- **City Justice System**: Professional relationships with judges and law enforcement
- **All Factions**: Maintains strict neutrality despite pressure from all sides
- **Former Military Contacts**: Network of veterans who can provide support if needed
- **Rehabilitation Specialists**: Works with various experts to improve prisoner programs

- Maintains detailed intelligence on prison gangs and their connections to city factions

3. The party needs to interview a dangerous prisoner, requiring negotiation with Marcus about security protocols.

## DM Notes
Warden Stonehand represents the principled civil servant who maintains institutional integrity despite political pressure. Use him to explore themes of justice, rehabilitation, and moral consistency. His prison can serve as a source of information, a secure meeting place, or the setting for rescue/extraction missions.
