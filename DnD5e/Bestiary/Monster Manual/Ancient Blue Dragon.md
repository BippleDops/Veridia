## Special Traits
***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (`dice: 2d10+9`) piercing damage plus 11 (`dice: 2d10`) lightning damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (`dice: 2d6+9`) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (`dice: 2d8+9`) bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales lightning in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw, taking 88 (`dice: 16d10`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Legendary Actions
The Ancient Blue Dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Ancient Blue Dragonregains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 ft. of the dragon must succeed on a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (`dice: 2d6+9`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
