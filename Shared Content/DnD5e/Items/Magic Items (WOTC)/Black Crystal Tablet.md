# Black Crystal Tablet

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** legendary

**Attunement**: *requires attunement* by a creature that has proficiency in the [[Arcana]] skill

## Description

Any creature that attunes to the tablet must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw at the end of its next long rest. On a failed save, the creature becomes afflicted with a random form of long-term madness (see "[[FoundryImport/Variant & Optional Rules/Madness|Madness]]" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master'sGuide).

As an action, a creature attuned to the Black Crystal Tablet can use it to cast [[eyebite]]  or [[gate]]  (the portal created by this spell links to the Far Realm only). After the tablet is used to cast a spell, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
