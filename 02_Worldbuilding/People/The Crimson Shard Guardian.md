# The Crimson Shard Guardian
*Bound Elemental, Herald of the Blood Plague*

## Overview
Once a pure water elemental summoned to cleanse the harbor, this entity has been corrupted by proximity to the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards|Crimson Shard]] for over a century. Now a twisted guardian of blood and disease, it dwells in the sunken merchant vessel *Fortune's Folly* at the bottom of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]] harbor, spreading crystal plague through the water.

## Description
- **Appearance**: Massive form of churning crimson water mixed with crystalline growths
- **Size**: 20 feet tall when fully manifested
- **Aura**: Waters within 100 feet turn reddish and feel feverish
- **Voice**: Gurgling whispers in Aquan and Primordial, speaks of "the red tide's blessing"

## Background
### The Binding
- Summoned 150 years ago by the Harbor Guild to clean pollution
- The sunken ship *Fortune's Folly* contained the hidden Crimson Shard
- Elemental became bound to the Shard during cleansing attempt
- Transformation took decades, now fully corrupted

### Current Role
- Unknowing guardian of the Crimson Shard
- Source of the crystal plague affecting Port Meridian
- Creates infected water that spreads disease
- Attacks anyone who approaches the wreck

## Abilities & Powers
- **Crystal Plague Generation**: Infects water with disease-causing crystals
- **Blood Water Control**: Commands corrupted water within harbor
- **Disease Immunity**: Cannot be affected by its own corruption
- **Shard Resonance**: Grows stronger when near other Shard fragments
- **Elemental Resilience**: Difficult to permanently destroy

## The Crimson Shard's Influence

### Physical Integration
The Crimson Shard has become physically integrated with both the Guardian and the sunken vessel *Fortune's Folly*. The fragment, roughly the size of a human fist, pulses with a malevolent crimson light that can be seen from the harbor surface on dark nights. Crystalline growths spread from the Shard like a cancer, covering the ship's hull in razor-sharp crimson formations that cut through water and flesh with equal ease.

The Guardian cannot exist more than a mile from the Shard - the artifact has become its anchor to this plane of existence. When the Guardian manifests fully, crimson veins of corrupted water flow directly from the Shard to its core, creating a visible tether of plague and power. This connection pulses with each heartbeat of the Shard, spreading corruption further into the harbor with every surge.

### Plague Mechanics
The crystal plague operates on multiple levels simultaneously:
- **Physical**: Crimson crystals grow from infected tissue, causing excruciating pain
- **Magical**: Drains magical energy from victims, feeding it back to the Shard
- **Spiritual**: Creates a psychic link between victims and the Guardian
- **Environmental**: Transforms water into a vector for further infection

Infected individuals experience progressive symptoms:
1. **Stage 1** (Days 1-3): Fever, muscle aches, small crystal formations under skin
2. **Stage 2** (Days 4-7): Crystal growths breach skin, causing bleeding and infection
3. **Stage 3** (Week 2): Major organ dysfunction as crystals invade internal systems
4. **Stage 4** (Week 3): Complete crystallization of extremities, loss of motor function
5. **Terminal Stage**: Full transformation into crystal plague carrier, controlled by Guardian

### Harbor Ecosystem Collapse
The corruption has created a dead zone expanding outward from the sunken ship:
- **Inner Zone** (0-100 yards): No natural life survives, water is thick with plague
- **Middle Zone** (100-300 yards): Mutated creatures, aggressive and diseased
- **Outer Zone** (300-500 yards): Fish flee, early signs of infection appearing
- **Warning Zone** (500+ yards): Animals sense danger, unusual behavior patterns

The harbor's economic value has plummeted as fishing becomes impossible and ships report mysterious damage to their hulls after docking. The corruption seeps into the city's water table through underground channels, threatening to transform Port Meridian into a plague city.

## Relationships

### Allies (Twisted)
- **Plague Spawn**: Lesser elementals created from infected harbor water, absolutely loyal
- **The Corrupted Schools**: Fish transformed into surveillance network throughout harbor
- **Crystal Plague Victims**: Terminal stage patients become Guardian's unwilling servants
- **Shadow Traders**: Black market dealers who profit from plague-derived substances

### Enemies
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/High Priestess Celeste Dawnbringer]]**: Actively researching purification methods
- **[[The Harbor Guild]]**: Desperate to eliminate the threat to their livelihood
- **[[The Purist Coalition]]**: See the Guardian as ultimate example of corruption
- **Marine Druids Circle**: Work to heal the dying harbor ecosystem

### Complicated
- **[[Harbor Master Luna Freedrift]]**: Knows the truth but fears citywide panic
- **[[The Dockworkers Union]]**: Some infected members hide symptoms to keep working
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]]**: Mysterious connection to Guardian's binding
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]]**: City leadership divided on how to address crisis
- **Criminal Syndicates**: Use plague threat for extortion but fear its spread


## Combat Tactics
- Fights defensively around the sunken ship
- Creates waves of diseased water to repel intruders
- Summons smaller plague elementals from infected harbor water
- Retreats deeper into ship when seriously wounded
- Becomes more aggressive if Shard is directly threatened

## Expanded Lair: The Sunken Fortune's Folly

### Ship Layout
**Upper Deck** (Partially Collapsed)
- Crystallized rigging creates maze of razor-sharp obstacles
- Captain's cabin contains pre-corruption records and personal effects
- Crow's nest serves as Guardian's observation post
- Plague crystals grow thickest here, closest to surface

**Main Deck**
- Cargo holds transformed into plague incubation chambers
- Crew quarters contain remains of original sailors
- Ship's wheel fused with crystal, still emanates navigation magic
- Hidden smuggling compartments with additional treasures

**Lower Deck** 
- Flooded chambers where plague elementals spawn
- Ship's shrine to sea gods corrupted into Shard altar
- Ballast area contains Guardian's captured victims
- Emergency supplies cache (potions, scrolls) preserved in crystal

**The Broken Figurehead** (Shard Location)
- Ornate mermaid carving split open to reveal Crimson Shard
- Crimson veins spread throughout ship from this point
- Touching figurehead directly causes immediate Stage 3 infection
- Can only be safely approached with proper magical protection

### Environmental Storytelling
- Scattered diary pages reveal crew's gradual realization of cargo's nature
- Crystallized corpses frozen in moments of terror or transformation
- Messages scratched into wood warning about "the red death"
- Personal effects suggesting wealthy merchant trying to smuggle Shard

## Connected Elements
- Central to [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]] Crimson Shard plotline
- Links to [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]] health crisis
- Connection to elemental plane corruption themes
- Part of larger Shard guardian network

On failure, they take 27 (6d8) necrotic damage and are infected with crystal plague. On success, they take half damage and aren't infected.

**Summon Plague Elementals (1/Day).** The Guardian spawns 1d4 Small plague water elementals (AC 14, 26 HP, +7 to hit, 1d6+4 acid damage plus crystal plague infection) that last for 10 minutes.

**Crimson Binding (1/Day).** The Guardian attempts to drag a creature into the harbor depths. One creature within 60 feet must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw.
