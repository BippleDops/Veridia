This is where I create notes that I don't have time to sort properly, or that I don't particularly care about. 
- Notes for testing things. 
- Notes for me to write quick notes that I intend to throw away later. 
- Notes where I can write the name of things I want to link to. 

I clean these up periodically. 

```statblock
monster: Goblin
```

```encounter
name: Example
creatures:
 - 3: Goblin, 5, 15, 2, 25 # 1 goblin with HP: 7, AC: 15, MOD: 2 worth 25 XP will be added.
```
