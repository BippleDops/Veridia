# Downtime Activity: Work
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 134* 

When all else fails, an adventurer can turn to an honest trade to earn a living. This activity represents a character's attempt to find temporary work, the quality and wages of which are difficult to predict.

## Resources

Performing a job requires one workweek of effort.

## Resolution

To determine how much money a character earns, the character makes an ability check: Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]), Dexterity ([[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]), Intelligence using a set of tools, Charisma ([[skills#Performance|Performance]]), or Charisma using a [[musical-instrument-xphb|musical instrument]]. Consult the Wages table to see how much money is generated according to the total of the check.

## Complications

Ordinary work is rarely filled with significant complications. Still, the Work Complications table can add some difficulties to a worker's life. Each workweek of activity brings a 10 percent chance that a character encounters a complication.
