--- # Friends

*cantrip, Enchantment* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** S, M (some makeup)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute You magically emanate a sense of friendship toward one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed condition for the duration. The target succeeds automatically if it isn't a Humanoid, if you're fighting it, or if you have cast this spell on it within the past 24 hours. The spell ends early if the target takes damage or if you make an attack roll, deal damage, or force anyone to make a saving throw. When the spell ends, the target knows it was [conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] by you. **Classes**: [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 277* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Friends xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of friends xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around friends xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Secret Pact - Summon ancient evil ## Plot Hooks - The authorities needs help finding before the new moon
