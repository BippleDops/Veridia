# Trap #27 - "I'm Sure You'll Get The Point!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The doors behind the stucco are, once cleared, revealed to be the same as the doors on the right, the .. [[Trap #4 - _Ye Olde Digit Dicer._|Ye Olde Digit Dicer]]" lock type. They consist of two large 10 foot by 10 foot panels, 10 feet tall. The locking mechanism will seem familiar, however these have a twist The party will discover to its chagrin that the door cannot be opened by a simple magic spell. In fact they cannot be opened by a complex magic spell either. They are two layers deep. The first was the decorative fresco coat that had to be chipped off before the party could even get at them. The second coat is a false stone veneer which is set in place over the real doors themselves. This stone veneer can be disolved by magic, and the real doors will be revealed. But we should deal with those who don't have high level wizards hanging on their coat tails.
> 
> If the delvers treat this door as if it were just the ordinary "stick something in in the right pattern" three-hole lock they are in for a surprise. By now they will have learned, if they have encountered this type of lock before, that using your own digits to trip the lock is detrimental to ones continued well being. Some form of device is likely to be employed in the holes in lieu of a digit. This will be fine as the trap works in a new and startling way.
> 
> Once the appropriate digit sized device is inserted in the door the trap is triggered. Out of all three finger holes will shoot 2 and 1/2 foot long steel darts. These darts are propelled by powerful springs, and as a result they will splinter any wooden or fleshy objects used. If the digit used is annored the point on the dart is such that it will penetrate any but the finest or magically protected armor.
> 
> As you can see this variation will cause some surprise to delvers who expect one thing and are served up yet another.
> 
> Once the delvers figure that the s􀄄one facade is not the real door either the party's rage will blast away the rock or the beefier warrior types will manually remove the stone. Revealed will be the faces of two massive bronze doors of exactly the same dimensions. They are works of the bronze casters art.
> 
> They depict the climactic scene of Evinrood's battle with the deamon lord. There are vile faced terrors swanning all about a central figure on the right who is marshaling them to the attack. On the left is the stumpy figure of Evinrood surrounded by ranks of earth, air, fire, and especially water elementals. Their vaguely humanoid faces are intent on the fight. All the monstrous faces are turned to face the observer, not the respective foe, only the wizard's faces are turned toward each other. On the left hand door there are three empty holes just like there were on the stone facia. (There may be a few of the delvers who do not realize that these are the holes out of which the darts fired. Don't clue them in, let them timidly probe them for awhile. It will serve to heighten their apprehension.)
> 
> The bronze is hardened to a surprising degree so the doors are not subject to any but the most powerful physical attack. The doors radiate the presence of a magical spell. As there is no other observable way to open the doors it is clear that they are magically locked and will require a mage to open them.
> 
> The spell required to unlock the doors is not a difficult one. Almost any intermediate level spell of opening will suffice to set off the trap, and open the doors.
> 
> The baleful malice-filled eyes, sunk like dark holes in the monstrous d􀄅amonic and elemental faces were just that, holes. From the eyes of every monster face shoot the 2 and 1/ 2 foot darts the party will have encountered from the three hole lock attempt in the stone facade. There are dozens of the darts and they cover the entire face of both doors. If the party is before the doors when the spell is cast there is a 40% chance (IA) of any one of them catching a dart. ff the character misses, the number by which he misses will determine the number of darts he receives. They will each do `dice: 1D6+3` in damage, and will be stopped only by magical armor, dwarven steel armor, or regular armor of extreme thickness.
> 
> Incidentally, if there are any of the tomb traipsers left at this point, the doors open by themselves and swing inward. They are three feet thick (so that the darts can be loaded into the works.) and counterweighted to swing freely. (Lest the party thinks of purloining the doors, \[Don 't laugh ifs happened before.) they are hollow, and their actual value (2,000 g.p.) is in the art work and in the trap mechanism within.)
> 
> The party will be free to continue on down the corridor thus revealed.
> 
> The door is a two skull trap, clever but the darts are a little wimpy to be rated three.
