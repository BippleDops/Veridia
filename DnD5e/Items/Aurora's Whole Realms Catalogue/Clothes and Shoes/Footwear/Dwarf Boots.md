### Dwarf Boots (Pic)

## Description
Crafted by the mining dwarves who wear them, these boots are extremely rugged. They have a steelreinforced toe and heel, as well as steel plating in the shin guard. They go to mid-shin. You can purchase these in human and dwarven sizes. At only 45 gp a pair, these boots are a “steel!”

## Additional Details
using these boots in unarmed combat, a kick will do `dice: 1d2` damage. However, the greater weight of these force a character to subtract 2 from any movement speed greater than walking (i.e., base move is 12, jog is 22, not 24).
