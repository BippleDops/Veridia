## Overview

The Whispering Peaks rise from the northern waters of [[Aquabyssos]] like the spines of some ancient, slumbering leviathan. These jagged mountains breach the surface in defiance of [[The Great Drowning]], their peaks shrouded in perpetual mist that carries the voices of countless souls who perished during the cataclysm. The winds here don't merely blow - they speak, carrying fragments of final words, dying prayers, and unfinished promises across the treacherous slopes.

This haunted archipelago serves as both sanctuary and prison for the [[Order of Azure Flame]], warrior-monks who have dedicated themselves to shepherding the restless dead and guarding against the whispers that threaten to drive visitors to madness.

### The Great Drowning Truth
The Order possesses evidence that the Great Drowning was not a natural disaster but a deliberate act of divine punishment. The spirits carry testimony that could expose those responsible.

### The Azure Flame's Origin
The eternal flame is actually powered by the concentrated regrets and unfulfilled promises of the living. Each person who visits and feels genuine remorse strengthens it.

### The Resurrection Ritual
Hidden in the deepest section of the Sunken Library is a complete ritual for reversing the Great Drowning, but it requires the willing sacrifice of everyone who has adapted to underwater life.

### The Spirit Army
The Order is secretly building an army of willing spirits who could be called upon to defend the living world against threats from [[The Hadal Depths]].
