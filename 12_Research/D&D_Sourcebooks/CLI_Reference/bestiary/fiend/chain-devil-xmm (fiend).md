Many serve powerful devils, wrenching secrets from imprisoned souls using deadly, animate chains. Left to their own devices, chain devils encourage ruthless individuals to pursue forbidden magic, leading their pupils down paths to the Nine Hells. Along with psychological threats and physical harm, a chain devil uses its unnerving gaze to make its victims perceive their worst fear rather than the monster. Roll on or choose a result from the Chain Devil Masks table to inspire a chain devil's fearful appearance. **Chain Devil Masks**`dice: [](chain-devil-xmm.md#^chain-devil-masks)`| dice: 1d4 | To a Viewer, the Chain Devil Looks Like... |
