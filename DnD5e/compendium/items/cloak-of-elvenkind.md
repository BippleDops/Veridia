# Cloak of Elvenkind
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Requires Attunement](/rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement)
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide, as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
