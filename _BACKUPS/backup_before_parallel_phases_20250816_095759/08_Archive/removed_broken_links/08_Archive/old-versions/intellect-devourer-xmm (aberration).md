These quadrupedal brains seek to ambush sapient beings, then drain their thoughts until they're mindless. Then, if their victims are Humanoids, they enter the creatures' skulls. With access to the victims' knowledge and control of their bodies, intellect devourers use their perfect disguises to pass as the people they've replaced and further mind flayer plots. > [!quote] A quote from Johana Grethe, Account of the Stormport Shock > > I know Durgan, and that wasn't Durgan. It was like something was wearing Durgan... Like some sort of suit... A Durgan suit.```statblock
