--- # Order of the Sunken Crown *"In the depths where light fails, we carry the burden of lost majesty."* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

The Order of the Sunken Crown is a secretive organization dedicated to preserving the memory and recovering the artifacts of an ancient underwater kingdom that was destroyed in a cataclysmic event predating the founding of Aquabyssos. Members believe they are guardians of a rightful claim to underwater rulership and work to gather evidence of their kingdom's former glory. ## Historical Background

Founded by survivors and descendants of the lost kingdom, the Order has operated in secret for centuries, slowly gathering artifacts and knowledge while avoiding persecution by Aquabyssos authorities who view them as potential threats. ## Current State

The Order has gained new relevance as dimensional instabilities reveal previously hidden ruins and artifacts from their lost kingdom. Some members advocate for open declaration of their claims, while others prefer continued secrecy. ### Duration

Lifetime membership with generational inheritance of obligations. ## Adventure Hooks

1. **Crown Fragment**: Discovery of artifact that proves Order's claims
2. **Infiltration Mission**: Government seeks to expose Order activities
3. **Succession Crisis**: Order must choose new leadership during political upheaval ## Campaign Use

Provides political intrigue, ancient mysteries, and moral complexity around legitimate authority and lost heritage. ## Player-Facing Summary Order of the Sunken Crown is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Order of the Sunken Crown as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Order of the Sunken Crown. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Hidden Prophecy of Shadows ## Plot Hooks - A map reveals a betrayal about the government
