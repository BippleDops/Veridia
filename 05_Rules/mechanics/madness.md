--- # Madness

*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 258. Available in the SRD* In a typical campaign, characters aren't driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Going Mad Various magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as [[Contact Other Plane Xphb and [Symbol Xphb]], can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects in the "Player's Handbook". Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them. Resisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw. If your game includes the [[new-ability-scores-honor-and-sanity (variant-rules) (see chapter 9, "Dungeon Master's Workshop"), a creature makes a Sanity saving throw instead. ## Madness Effects Madness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness. A character afflicted with **short-term madness** is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness table for`d10`minutes. A character afflicted with **long-term madness** is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness table for``dice: 1d10` Ã— 10`hours. A character afflicted with **indefinite madness** gains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured. ## Curing Madness A [Calm Emotions Xphb]] spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a [[Lesser Restoration Xphb spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, [Remove Curse Xphb]] or [[dispel-evil-and-good-xphb (spells) might also prove effective. A [greater-restoration-xphb (spells)]] spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinite madness. ## Player-Facing Summary Madness is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of madness as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around madness. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is hunting an heir for revenge
