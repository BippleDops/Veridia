# Bandit Camp

## Overview

The prosperous trade routes connecting the Windlass Islands have fallen victim to an increasingly bold group of brigands known as the Windlass Raiders. What began as isolated attacks on merchant vessels has escalated into a coordinated campaign that threatens to cripple commerce throughout the region. The raiders operate from a hidden base somewhere in the maze of rocky coves and abandoned islands that dot the outer Windlass chain, striking merchant ships with precision that suggests inside knowledge of shipping schedules and cargo manifests.

Merchant Lord Cassius Goldtide of the powerful Merchant's Consortium has posted a substantial bounty for the elimination of the bandit threat. However, local fishermen whisper different stories—tales of desperate families driven to piracy by crushing debts and impossible trade restrictions imposed by the very merchants now demanding protection. The raiders are led by Captain "Redbeard" Torrino, a former merchant marine who allegedly turned to piracy after his family's fishing business was destroyed by unfair trade practices.

The truth behind the Windlass Raiders reveals a complex web of economic exploitation, social injustice, and survival desperation. The party must navigate not only the physical challenge of locating and confronting the well-fortified bandit camp, but also the moral complexity of determining whether the raiders are simple criminals or victims of a broken system fighting back. Their choices will determine not just the fate of the bandits, but the future of trade relations and social justice throughout the Windlass Islands.
