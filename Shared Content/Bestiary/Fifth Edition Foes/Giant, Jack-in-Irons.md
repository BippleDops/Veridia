## Special Traits
**Pound:** A jack-in-irons that grapples an opponent of Medium size or smaller can smash the opponent into the ground or any other nearby solid object as an attack. This attack hits automatically and does 15 (`dice: 2d8+6`) bludgeoning damage and the creature must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the start of the giant's next turn.

**Shake the Earth:** As an action, a jack-inirons can stomp its foot on the ground, causing powerful vibrations to radiate out around the giant. Any creature within 10 feet of the jack-in-irons must make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A jack-inirons giant makes two melee attacks in any combination of club, chain, fist, and pound, or it makes two ranged attacks, or it shakes the earth (see above).

**Club:** *Melee Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 22 (`dice: 3d10+6`) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 17 Strength saving throw or be incapacitated until the start of the giant's next turn.

**Chain:*** Melee Attack*: +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (`dice: 2d10+6`) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled and restrained until the start of the giant's next turn.

**Fist:** *Melee Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (`dice: 2d8+6`) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be knocked prone.

## Description
A jack-in irons giant steal chains from gates, portcullises, and wherever else it can get them, and fastens them all around its body, with a special emphasis on the wrists, forearms, shins, throats, and shoulders. They collect the heads of their victims as trophies and fashion them into grisly belts and necklaces.

Most jack-in-irons giants dwell in ruined towers overlooking remote stretches of roads. From this base, they watch for lone travelers, pilgrims, and even guarded caravans to ambush and sack. Armored knights are their favored prey. They have been known to take prisoners and hold them for high ransom, but bargaining with a jack-in-irons is always a tricky undertaking; as often as not, they become bored or angry during the process and simply kill their captives, regardless of whether they’ve been promised or even paid a ransom for them.

Orcs and goblins sometimes follow a jack-in-irons as their king or leader because of its size, strength, and bottomless capacity for wickedness. Such a company almost never includes more than one jack-in-irons, however, because none will submit to the command of another.

A jack-in-irons stands about 18 feet tall. It prefers to dress in dark colors such as black or brown and always drapes itself in chains. Its hair is dark and matted, and many male jacks-in-irons sport thick, bushy beards. Its eyes are purplish-black with light green irises.

A jack-in-irons is not a clever opponent. They rely almost exclusively on brute strength until they run out of enemies. Most fight only to the death, because they believe themselves invincible—as indeed they are, until someone defeats and kills them.
