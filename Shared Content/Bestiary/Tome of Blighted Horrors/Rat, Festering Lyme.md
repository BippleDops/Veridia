# Rat, Festering Lyme
## Overview
### Rat, Festering Lyme
![[td04vrls.2oo.png|Rat, Festering Lyme|300]]
[[td04vrls.2oo.png|open outside]]

*This revolting, diseased-looking rat is the size of a small dog. It is covered in lice that visibly swarm in its filthy, matted fur.*

**Alignment**: Unaligned

**Initiative**: +2

**Armor Class**: 9 (`dice: 2d6 + 2`)

**Speed**: 30 ft.

**Challenge**: CR 1/4

**Experience**: 50 XP

## Other Details
**Ability Scores**: Str 8 (-1), Dex 14 (+2), Con 12 (+1), Int 2 -4), Wis 10 (+1), Cha 4 (-3)

**Damage Resistances**: Acid damage

**Damage Immunities**: Disease

**Senses**: Darkvision 60 ft.

**Languages**: None

**Size**: Small

**Type**: Monstrosity

## Special Traits
**Delusional Infestation:** A creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of a festering Lyme rat and can see it must make a successful DC 11 Wis saving throw or have tactical disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its turn, as it imagines thousands of bugs crawling over it. A successful save leaves a creature immune to Delusional Infestation for 24 hours.

**Filth Fever:** A creature with filth fever becomes sick `dice: 1d4` days after being infected. At that time, the creature gains 1 level of exhaustion. It also regains only half the usual number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from resting. Once symptoms appear, the infected creature must make a DC 11 Con saving throw after every long rest. If it fails, the creature gains 1 level of exhaustion; if it succeeds, the creature loses 1 level of exhaustion. The disease is cured when the creature has no exhaustion.

**Pack Attack:** The festering Lyme rat has tactical advantage on its attack roll if the target is within 5 feet of another Lyme rat or giant rat that’s able to attack.

## Actions
**Melee Attack—Bite:** +4 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d4 + 2` piercing damage, and the creature must make a successful DC 11 Con saving throw or be infected with filth fever (see below).

## Description
**Environment**: Urban (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary or pack (2–20)

Festering Lyme rats inhabit the sewers, canals, and subterranean waterways of the blighted city of Castorhage. Similar in appearance to giant rats, the Lyme rat, possibly through the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]]’s proximity to Between, can affect those who see it with a momentary delusion of parasitic infestation.
