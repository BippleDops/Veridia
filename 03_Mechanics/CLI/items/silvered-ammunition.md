# Silvered Ammunition
*Ammunition, minor*  



Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver ammunition, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their ammunition in silver. You can silver ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the ammunition without making it less effective.

## Player-Facing Summary

Silvered ammunition is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of silvered ammunition as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around silvered ammunition.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties silvered ammunition to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at silvered ammunition to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to silvered ammunition active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
