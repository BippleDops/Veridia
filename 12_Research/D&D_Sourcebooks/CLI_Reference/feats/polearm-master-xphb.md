# Polearm Master
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 206*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th; Strength 13 or higher or 4th; Dexterity 13 or higher

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Dexterity or Strength by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Pole Strike.** Immediately after you take the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Attack|Attack]] action and attack with a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/quarterstaff-xphb|Quarterstaff]], a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/spear-xphb|Spear]], or a weapon that has the Heavy and Reach properties, you can use a Bonus Action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon. The weapon deals Bludgeoning damage, and the weapon's damage die for this attack is a `d4`.

**Reactive Strike.** While you're holding a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/quarterstaff-xphb|Quarterstaff]], a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/spear-xphb|Spear]], or a weapon that has the Heavy and Reach properties, you can take a Reaction to make one melee attack against a creature that enters the reach you have with that weapon.
