## Description
We here at Aurora’s cater to the noble who has a passel of knights in shining armor, but no way to [[Dress|dress]] them up. We gladly offer our tabards to make your men-at-arms look their finest. Through special order only, we will produce any number of tabards with your royal crest, the insignia of the city, or any other special symbol you might have in mind. Our rates are competitive, and our service is fast and reliable.


| **Quantity:** | **Cost per tabard:** |
|---|---|
| up to 20 | 6 sp |
| 20 to 50 | 5 sp |
| 50 to 200 | 4 sp |
| 200 or more | 3 sp |

As always, we use the finest dyes from Baldur’s Gate to insure colorfastness, and linen imported from Daerlun. You are guaranteed the standard colors (white, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, brown, and black), and, because these are ordered in quantity, we will blend colors for you, as well. Our many satisfied customers include Waterdeep, Elturel, and Selgaunt.
