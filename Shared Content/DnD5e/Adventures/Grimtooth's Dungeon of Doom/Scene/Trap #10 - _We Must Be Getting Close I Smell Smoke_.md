# Trap #10 - "We Must Be Getting Close I Smell Smoke"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> Opening the door to the right will lead the delvers into a short stairway leading up. It is 20 feet long, 10 feet wide, and an average of 10 feel in height. At the far end is a door. In stead of the usual three finger hole door this one is made of cast bronze.
> 
> Located in the center of the door is a large wheel. It will seem that to open the door you will need to turn the wheel. If some hapless delver does this the trap will will begin to operate.
> 
> In a cistern above the "door" is located a pool of lead kept molten by the "kid brother" to the [[Elemental, Fire (D&D 5e SRD)|fire elemental]] in the room below. His only task is to keep the "hot side hot.." The door itself is filled with hollow tubes, and while it is quite solid, and thick (5 inches) there are enough of these tubes to carry a substantial amount of this molten lead through the door. This is exactly what will occur when the wheel is turned. The wheel turning will also result in a panel al the base of the door opening to aUow the tubes within the door to drain out onto the stairs!
> 
> The fun is really under way now. The party on the stairs is being treated to a wonderful hot foot. The lead that reaches the [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|water]] in the lower room will start to create a sauna effect in the stairwell. The first boob that tries to tum the wheel will find out that the entire door is red hot including the wheel, making it crippling to try to turn it off without insulation.
> 
> This is a one skull trap, no [[17 - Damage and Healing (D&D 5e SRD)|death]] but much dishonor. The beauty of this trap is that the wheel is like a combination [[Lock (D&D 5e SRD)|lock]], you have to turn it in a direction that will activate the trap, then tum the trap off, (at risk of if not life then at least limb.) and then tum it in the "on" direction again to open the door. The second time you turn it "on" it will open.
