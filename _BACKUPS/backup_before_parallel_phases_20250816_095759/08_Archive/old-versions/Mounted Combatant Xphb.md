--- # Mounted Combatant

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 205* **Prerequisite**: 4th You gain the following benefits. **Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom by 1, to a maximum of 20. **Mounted Strike.** While "mounted", you have Advantage on attack rolls against any unmounted creature within 5 feet of your mount that is at least one size smaller than the mount. **Leap Aside.** If your mount is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw and only half damage if it fails. For your mount to gain this benefit, you must be riding it, and neither of you can have the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated condition. **Veer.** While "mounted", you can force an attack that hits your mount to hit you instead if you don't have the [conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] condition. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Mounted combatant xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
