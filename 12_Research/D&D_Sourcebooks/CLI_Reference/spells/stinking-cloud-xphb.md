# Stinking Cloud
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a rotten egg)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 20-foot-radius [[sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]] of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud is [[heavily-obscured-xphb|Heavily Obscured]]. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a strong wind (such as the one created by [[gust-of-wind-xphb|Gust of Wind]]) disperses it.

Each creature that starts its turn in the [[sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]] must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition until the end of the current turn. While [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] in this way, the creature can't take an action or a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]].
