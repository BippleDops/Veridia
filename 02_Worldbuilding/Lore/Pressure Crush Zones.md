# Pressure Crush Zones

*"Where the deep grows deeper still, and even water becomes a weapon."*

## Overview
Pressure Crush Zones are areas of extreme water pressure that exist at the deepest reaches of Aquabyssos, where even magically protected individuals risk catastrophic injury or death. These zones form naturally around abyssal trenches and artificial deep excavations, creating barriers that limit exploration and serve as natural defensive positions.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
Occur at extreme depths where:
- Water pressure exceeds standard magical protection
- Dimensional instabilities amplify pressure effects
- Multiple pressure sources converge
- Natural or magical barriers fail

### Effects
- **Instant Crushing**: Unprotected individuals suffer immediate fatal damage
- **Equipment Failure**: Even magical items may be destroyed
- **Magical Disruption**: Spells become unreliable or fail
- **Navigation Hazard**: Zones create no-passage areas

### Duration
Permanent environmental features requiring specialized equipment to traverse.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Zone Mapping**: Chart safe passages through crush zone areas
2. **Rescue Mission**: Someone trapped in expanding crush zone
3. **Zone Weaponization**: Military applications of artificial crush zones

## Campaign Use
Provides natural barriers and extreme environmental challenges for deep-sea exploration adventures.
