# Shadow Surgeons Collective

**Type:** Criminal/Medical Organization  
**Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral (officially), Chaotic Evil (in practice)  
**Size:** ~300 active members  
**Territory:** [[Shadow Market Canals]], hidden facilities throughout [[Aquabyssos]]  
**Leadership:** The Silhouette Surgeon Prime (identity unknown)  
**Goals:** Perfect memory manipulation, elimination of trauma and suffering

## Overview
The Shadow Surgeons Collective operates in the gray areas between medicine and crime, using shadow magic to perform impossible medical procedures. What began as legitimate trauma treatment using shadow-enhanced surgery has evolved into a sophisticated organization trafficking in stolen memories, shadow-transplanted organs, and psychological warfare conducted through umbral manipulation. They believe that shadows hold the essence of suffering and that by surgically removing these "shadow wounds," they can heal both body and mind - though their methods often create more darkness than they dispel.

## Philosophy and Methods

### The Shadow Surgery Doctrine
The Collective operates under the belief that all pain, trauma, and disease cast "shadows" within the human body and mind - literal manifestations of suffering that can be surgically removed using shadow magic. Their core tenets include:

- **The Shadow Wound Theory**: Every injury, emotional or physical, creates a corresponding shadow that festers if left untreated
- **Umbral Healing**: True healing requires operating in the shadowfell simultaneously with the material plane
- **Pain as Poison**: Suffering is not character-building but a toxin that corrupts the soul
- **Shadow Transplantation**: Healthy shadows from willing donors can replace diseased ones
- **The Greater Darkness**: Sometimes creating small shadows prevents larger ones from forming

### Shadow-Enhanced Medical Procedures
- **Umbral Anesthesia**: Patients' consciousness is shifted into their own shadow, making them completely numb to pain
- **Shadow Organ Transplants**: Replacing failing organs with shadow-enhanced versions that adapt to the recipient
- **Memory Shadow Extraction**: Traumatic memories manifest as shadow parasites that can be surgically removed
- **Empathic Shadow Surgery**: Surgeons share the patient's shadow-pain to better understand the condition
- **Temporal Shadow Healing**: Operating on the patient's past-shadow to prevent future complications

## History and Formation
**Founded:** 20 years after the Great Drowning  
**Origin:** Dr. Marina Voidwright's research into healing trauma survivors

## DM Notes

### Using the Shadow Surgeons

- **Investigation Focus**: Crimes leave subtle clues requiring careful detection
- **Personal Stakes**: Make memory theft feel like a violation of character identity

### Balancing the Threat
- Memory modification should have limitations and side effects
- Provide ways for characters to detect and resist mental manipulation
- Show both positive and negative applications of memory surgery
- Give players agency in how to deal with this ethically complex organization

> [!danger] DM Secret
> The Silhouette Surgeon Prime is actually three different people sharing a single identity through memory synchronization. They take turns being "Prime" and have divided their original personalities among themselves to better run the organization. None of them remembers being a complete individual, and discovering this truth could either destroy the Collective or make them even more dangerous as they seek to become whole again.
