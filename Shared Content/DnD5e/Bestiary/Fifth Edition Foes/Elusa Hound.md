## Special Traits
**Arcane Sight:** Elusa hounds detect magical auras as if they are under a permanent detect magic spell with a radius of 120 feet. This has the added benefit that an elusa hound can instantly identify any spellcaster within range.

**Aura Tracking:** Once an elusa hound has seen the magical aura of a living creature with its arcane sight ability, or has seen the magical residue of a spell or effect created by a particular spellcaster or other creature, it gets tactical advantage on Survival checks to follow that spellcaster's trail. The trail must be no more than three hours old for the elusa hound to get this bonus.

**Stand Guard:** When an elusa hound knocks a target prone, it can choose to grapple the target automatically. The target can't stand up unless it first escapes the grapple. While the hound has a target grappled, it can bite only that creature.

## Actions
**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature,. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d8+2`) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate forests and plains

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, or pack (4â€“7)

## Description
Elusa hounds are kept and trained by many different types of creatures, but always for the same purpose: tracking (and sometimes killing) magicwielders. These creatures can detect the emanations given off by arcane and divine spellcasters, and they follow this trail like bloodhounds following a scent.

The origin of elusa hounds has mystified even the most learned of sages. They seem to be born of magic, but no spellcaster in his or her right mind would ever create such a beast.

Renegade bands enthralled with the idea of ridding the world of spellcasters sometimes employ elusa hounds. Civilized towns and cities likewise use them in places where magic is forbidden or is policed by the local government, or where rogue magic-users often cause trouble. In other instances, they are used by spellcasters to ferret out rivals or to track down stolen magic items.

When given instructions to track and kill their target, a pack of elusa hounds uses tactics similar to other canines: they circle the prey and attack simultaneously from all sides. These beasts can be trained to pin or hold a foe rather than kill it. This tactic is often employed by handlers when they wish to capture and interrogate a renegade spellcaster. When using these tactics, the elusa hound attempts to trip its foe and then pins it with a bite.

Elusa hounds radiate a moderate aura of divination magic if examined with a *detect magic* spell or similar effect.
