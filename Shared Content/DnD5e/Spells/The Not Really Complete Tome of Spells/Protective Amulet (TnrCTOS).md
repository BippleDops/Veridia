# Protective Amulet (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *1st-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 hour

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (an item of jewelry that costs 50 gp per level of the spell it is de-signed to protect against)


## Effects
You enchant an amulet with the ability to protect the wearer from a specific spell that you know how to cast and that allows for a saving throw.

When the wearer is attacked by that spell and fails the saving throw, the amulet ab-sorbs the magic and shatters, protecting the wearer.
