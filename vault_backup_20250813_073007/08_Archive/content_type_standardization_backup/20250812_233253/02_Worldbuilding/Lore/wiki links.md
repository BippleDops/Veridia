# Wiki Links

*"Knowledge connects like current flows - follow the links to find truth."*

## Overview
Wiki Links represent the interconnected knowledge system used throughout both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor to cross-reference information, track relationships between concepts, and maintain the complex web of connections that define the campaign world. This system allows for rapid information retrieval and helps identify patterns across seemingly unrelated events and locations.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
- Consistent linking conventions
- Regular link maintenance and updates
- Cross-realm information verification
- Access control for sensitive information

### Effects
- **Information Navigation**: Rapid access to related concepts
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies connections between events
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Maintains institutional memory
- **Research Efficiency**: Accelerates investigation processes

### Duration
Ongoing system requiring regular maintenance and updates.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Broken Links**: Information network disrupted by sabotage
2. **Hidden Connections**: Characters discover unexpected relationships
3. **Information War**: Competing factions manipulate knowledge networks

## Campaign Use
Provides framework for managing complex world information and creating investigation-based adventures.

## Player-Facing Summary

Wiki links is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of wiki links as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around wiki links.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
