## Description
No manor house or castle would be complete without a harpsichord. This large and versatile instrument, when played by one or two keyboardists, produces a cheerful jangling that will fill any room. But, when notes come few and slow it creates a sober and pensive effect. All our harpsichords come from a gnomish master in Selgaunt, and all must be special ordered. Prices are highly individualized, according to materials required.
