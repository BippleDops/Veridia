--- # Weird Tank

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/weird-tank.webp#right) A weird tank is a ten-gallon tank of blown glass and sculpted bronze with a backpack-like carrying harness fashioned from tough leather. A [[water-weird-xmm (elemental) is contained within the tank. While wearing the tank, you can use an action to open it, allowing the [water-weird-xmm (elemental)]] to emerge. The [[water-weird-xmm (elemental) acts immediately after you in the initiative order, and it is bound to the tank. You can command the [water-weird-xmm (elemental)]] telepathically (no action required) while you wear the tank. You can close the tank as an action only if you have first commanded the [[water-weird-xmm (elemental) to retract into it or if the [water-weird-xmm (elemental)]] is dead. If the [[water-weird-xmm (elemental) is killed, the tank loses its magical containment property until it spends at least 24 hours inside an elemental water node. When the tank is recharged, a new [water-weird-xmm (elemental)]] forms inside it. The tank has AC 15, 50 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing the tank to 0 hit points destroys it and the [[water-weird-xmm (elemental)]] contained within it. *Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 223* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Weird tank pota is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of weird tank pota as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around weird tank pota. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Shadow Covenant - Achieve immortality ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
