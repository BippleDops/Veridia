## Description
Strapping blades to one’s feet and then propelling one’s self at high speeds across a thin and profoundly slick field of ice that overlies a bottomless and near-frozen lake sounds like a bad idea to me. Nevertheless, skating is all the rage in the north. We offer strap-on skates (3 gp) that can turn any stiff-soled footwear into instant skates. We also offer skates in the typical shoe sizes: gnome for 7 gp, halfling for 8 gp, elf for 9 gp, and human for 10 gp.

## Additional Details
(new) Skating proficiency takes 1 slot in general group—(Dex/0); nonproficient move at ¼ speed
