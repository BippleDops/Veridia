--- # Compulsion

*4th-level, Enchantment* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute Each creature of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed condition until the spell ends. For the duration, you can take a [Action Xphb]] to designate a direction that is horizontal to you. Each [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed target must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that direction on its next turn, taking the safest route. After moving in this way, a target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success. **Classes**: [classes]]; [[classes *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 252.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of compulsion xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around compulsion xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Related Notes - [Similar Topic 1]]
