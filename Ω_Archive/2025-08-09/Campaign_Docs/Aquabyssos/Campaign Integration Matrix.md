## üìù DM Integration Tools

### The Connection Tracker

Track these between campaigns:
- [ ] Shared NPC status/location
- [ ] Faction reputation changes
- [ ] Major event ripples
- [ ] Timeline/reality alterations
- [ ] Character crossovers
- [ ] Thematic resonances

### Campaign Influence Points

Actions in one campaign earn points affecting others:

**Major Decision** (10 points):
- Changes fundamental reality aspect
- Affects all campaigns

**Significant Action** (5 points):
- Kills/saves major NPC
- Alters important location
- Influences 2-3 campaigns

**Minor Ripple** (1 point):
- Small change noticed
- Affects 1 other campaign

**At 25 points**: Reality convergence event

---

## üåä The Ultimate Convergence

### When All Campaigns Merge

**The Five-Path Apocalypse**:
1. **Political**: Shadows vote reality out of existence
2. **Recursive**: Infinite collapse to singular point
3. **Divine**: Gods wake and reshape everything
4. **Memorial**: Everyone forgets everything
5. **Awakening**: The Mother's dream ends

### The Synthesis Ending

If parties from all campaigns work together:
- Parliament provides governance structure
- Recursion provides infinite resources
- Leviathan provides divine power
- Memory Wars provides historical control
- Depth Mother provides reality framework

**Result**: New stable reality incorporating all elements

### The Cascade Failure

If campaigns work against each other:
- Reality tears apart at contradictions
- Each campaign's reality splits off
- Multiverse of incompatible truths
- Players choose which reality to inhabit

## üéØ Quick Integration Reference

### Universal Constants

- Memory has power and value
- Reality is more fluid than it appears
- The depths change everyone
- No solution is perfect

### Universal Questions
- What makes someone real?
- Can consciousness be copied?
- Is transformation death?
- Does truth matter if no one remembers?
- What price is too high for survival?

### Universal Threats
- Complete shadow replacement
- Total memory erasure
- Reality collapse
- Divine awakening
- The Mother waking

*"Run one campaign, tell one story. Run all campaigns, tell the truth."*
‚Äî The Integration Codex

## Using This Matrix

1. **Start with one campaign**
2. **Plant seeds for others**
3. **Let players discover connections**
4. **React to their theories**
5. **Weave their ideas into truth**
6. **Build toward convergence**
7. **Let them choose the ending**

The beauty of Aquabyssos is that all campaigns are true simultaneously. They're different perspectives on the same cosmic horror‚Äîthat reality itself might be drowning in something's dream.

**The depths await. How deep will you go?**
