# The Second Rising

## Quest Overview

The Oracle bloodline has spoken again after centuries of silence. The prophecy states that Aquathys must make a choice within the month: Rise to the surface and face an unknown fate, sink deeper to escape a growing threat, or find a third path that no one has yet imagined. The entire underwater civilization hangs in the balance.

## The Prophecy

*"When pearl meets iron in the market of sky,*
*When crimson blood taints the deepest tide,*
*When warriors question and prophets cry,*
*The sunken empire must choose its side.*

*Three paths diverge in the pressured dark:*
*The Rising burns but frees the soul,*
*The Sinking saves but leaves no mark,*
*The Third transforms and makes us whole.*

*Seek ye the Heart that sank us down,*
*Find ye the Verses hidden deep,*
*Unite the Five or watch them drown,*
*Wake the Truth that ancient sleeps."*

## Part 1: The Prophecy Investigation

### The Pearl and Iron
[[01_Campaigns/NPCs/Gareth_Ironforge]] and [[Master Smith Coral-Hammer]] have been working on a project that unexpectedly fulfills this line. Their pressure-forged weapons are creating a resonance that's awakening something ancient.

### The Crimson Taint
[[01_Campaigns/NPCs/The_Crimson_Pearl]]'s vampire nature is spreading - she's accidentally created three new sea-vampire spawn who are contaminating the deepest trenches with undead energy.

### The Questioning and Crying
- [[Commander Varek Irontrident]] has discovered evidence the original threat was fabricated
- [[Prophet Miralyn Surfacer]] leads growing protests for return

## Part 2: The Hidden Verses

### First Verse Location
**[[The Sunken Library of Thalassius]]**
- Guarded by knowledge elementals
- Contains Emperor's personal account
- Reveals the Void Plague might have been stopped differently

### Second Verse Location
**[[Depths of Whispers]]**
- Held by [[Aboleth Prime Yoth'zagoth]]
- Requires negotiation or combat
- Shows the Aboleths caused the original threat

### Third Verse Location
**[[01_Campaigns/Locations/Market_District]] - Secret Vault**
- [[01_Campaigns/NPCs/Gareth_Ironforge]]'s ancestor hid it
- Links surface and depth permanently
- Contains the transformation ritual

## Part 3: The Heart of Oceanus

The artifact that sank Aquathys was broken into five pieces:

### Heart Fragments

1. **The Core** - [[High Tidecaller Nerissa]] wears it
2. **The Pulse** - Hidden in [[The Maw of Darkness]]
3. **The Flow** - [[01_Campaigns/NPCs/The_Crimson_Pearl]]'s pearl collection
4. **The Pressure** - [[Commander Varek Irontrident]]'s trident
5. **The Memory** - Inside [[Prophet Miralyn Surfacer]]

## Part 4: The Five Factions

Each faction leader must be dealt with:

### Diplomatic Path
- Convince each leader of the best choice
- Requires different approach for each
- Skill challenges and roleplay heavy

### Combat Path
- Defeat leaders who won't cooperate
- Changes political landscape dramatically
- Makes final choice harder

### Manipulation Path
- Pit factions against each other
- Use [[01_Campaigns/NPCs/The_Crimson_Pearl]]'s network
- Morally questionable but effective

## Part 5: The Truth

### The Real History
- The Void Plague was real but created by Aboleths
- Emperor knew but chose sinking to break their power
- Surface world survived through other means
- Aboleths want to keep Aquathys submerged

### Current Threat
- Aboleths are losing control
- Something darker stirs beneath them
- Surface nations plan to invade
- The transformation option could save both worlds

## Part 6: The Choice

### Option 1: Rise Completely
**Consequences:**
- Aquathys returns to surface
- Massive casualties from pressure change
- War with surface nations likely
- Aboleths lose all power
- [[01_Campaigns/Locations/Pearl_Harbor_City]] becomes capital

### Option 2: Sink Deeper
**Consequences:**
- Escape to underwater plane
- Complete isolation from surface
- Aboleth control strengthens
- Safety but stagnation
- [[The Maw of Darkness]] becomes gateway

### Option 3: The Transformation
**Consequences:**
- Aquathys exists in both realms
- Citizens can shift between forms
- Permanent link to [[01_Campaigns/Locations/Market_District]]
- New hybrid civilization
- Party becomes legends
