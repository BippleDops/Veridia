# Timeline Tracker Base

*"Time flows like current - track its passage or be swept away."*

## Overview
Timeline Tracker Base provides the foundational framework for maintaining chronological consistency across the complex inter-realm campaign. This system tracks parallel time streams, dimensional synchronization, and the temporal effects of magical phenomena that can alter the flow of time differently in various locations.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
- Regular chronological updates
- Dimensional time differential calculations
- Event sequence documentation
- Temporal anomaly monitoring

### Effects
- **Chronological Consistency**: Maintains timeline accuracy
- **Event Correlation**: Links cause and effect across time
- **Temporal Anomaly Detection**: Identifies time distortions
- **Campaign Continuity**: Preserves narrative coherence

### Duration
Ongoing campaign tool requiring constant maintenance.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Time Paradox**: Characters must resolve temporal inconsistency
2. **Timeline Investigation**: Research historical events with contradictory records
3. **Temporal Anchor**: Establish fixed points to prevent timeline drift

## Campaign Use
Essential tool for managing complex narrative threads and temporal elements in multi-realm adventures.
