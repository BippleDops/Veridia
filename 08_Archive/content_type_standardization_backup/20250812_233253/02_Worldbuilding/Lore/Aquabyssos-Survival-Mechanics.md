# Aquabyssos Survival & Adaptation Mechanics

## Core Pressure System

### Depth Zones
The underwater realm is divided into distinct pressure zones, each with increasing dangers and requirements:

| Depth | Zone Name | Pressure DC | Effects | Adaptation Required |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| 0-500 ft | Sunlight Zone | DC 10 | Disadvantage on Perception | None |
| 500-1000 ft | Twilight Zone | DC 12 | Exhaustion risk, darkvision required | Level 1 |
| 1000-3000 ft | Midnight Zone | DC 15 | Exhaustion, crushing pressure | Level 2 |
| 3000-6000 ft | Abyssal Zone | DC 18 | Rapid exhaustion, madness risk | Level 3 |
| 6000-10000 ft | Hadal Zone | DC 20 | Extreme pressure, reality distortion | Level 4 |
| 10000+ ft | The Void Depths | DC 25 | Existential damage, identity loss | Level 5 |

### Pressure Saves
**Frequency**: Every hour at depth (every 10 minutes during strenuous activity)
**Save**: Constitution
**Failure Effects**:
- **1st Failure**: 1 level of exhaustion
- **2nd Failure**: 1d6 bludgeoning damage + 1 exhaustion
- **3rd Failure**: 2d6 bludgeoning damage + unconscious
- **4th Failure**: Death (pressure implosion)

**Critical Failure (Natural 1)**: Immediate progression to next failure stage
**Critical Success (Natural 20)**: Immune to pressure for next 4 hours

## Depth Adaptation System

### Adaptation Points
Characters accumulate adaptation points through exposure to depths. These represent physical and mental changes as the body adjusts to underwater existence.

**Gaining Adaptation Points**:
- 1 point per day at 500-1000 ft
- 2 points per day at 1000-3000 ft
- 3 points per day at 3000-6000 ft
- 5 points per day at 6000+ ft

- No additional effects

#### Murky Water
- Vision reduced to 10 ft
- Disadvantage on Perception
- Half swimming speed

#### Liquid Air (Transition Zones)

- CON save DC 18 or lose 1 HD permanently
- Cannot be healed while submerged
- Causes madness on prolonged exposure

### Breathing Complications

**Surface Dweller in Water**:
- Can hold breath 1 + CON modifier minutes
- After that, CON save DC 10 (+1 per round)
- Failure = 0 HP and dying

**Adapted Being in Air**:
- Reverse drowning rules apply
- Time based on adaptation level
- Painful transformation back possible

**Hybrid Breathing**:
- Can switch between air/water
- Requires 1 round to adapt lungs
- Causes fatigue if done repeatedly

## Corruption & Transformation

### Crystal Corruption (Aethermoor Crossover)
When crystal plague meets depth adaptation:

| Corruption + Adaptation | Result |
|------------------------|---------|
| Both Low (1-25) | Choose which progresses |
| Both Medium (26-50) | Both progress at half rate |
| Both High (51-75) | Unstable hybrid form |
| Both Extreme (76+) | Becomes unique entity |

### Shadow Integration
Underwater shadows behave differently:

**Shadow Independence Stages**:
1. **Depth 0-1000 ft**: Shadows behave normally
2. **Depth 1000-3000 ft**: Shadows lag behind movement
3. **Depth 3000-6000 ft**: Shadows act independently at times
4. **Depth 6000+ ft**: Shadow may separate completely

**Shadow Separation Save**:
- Charisma save DC = 10 + (depth in thousands of feet)
- Failure = Shadow acts independently for 1 hour
- Critical Failure = Shadow attempts replacement

**Frequency**: 1-2 per week in deep zones
**Effects**:

### Memory Tides
**Frequency**: Twice yearly, predictable
**Effects**:

## Madness & Sanity

### Depth Madness
Prolonged exposure to depths causes specific insanities:

|-------|--------------|---------|
| 1000-3000 ft | Pressure Euphoria | Disadvantage on Wisdom, advantage on Constitution |
| 3000-6000 ft | The Calling | Hear whispers, must make WIS saves to resist swimming deeper |
| 6000-10000 ft | Identity Dissolution | Forget name, class features intermittent |
| 10000+ ft | Void Communion | Speak to nothingness, gain forbidden knowledge |

### Madness Saves
**Triggers**:

## Designer Notes
These mechanics create pressure (pun intended) for players to make difficult choices about adaptation. The system rewards gradual acclimation while punishing rapid changes. The social mechanics ensure that becoming adapted has roleplay consequences beyond just statistics.

The interplay between crystal corruption and depth adaptation creates unique character development paths. Players must balance the benefits of adaptation against the loss of their surface identity.

Remember: The mechanics serve the horror of transformation. Use them to enhance the narrative of losing humanity to the depths, not as a punishment system.
