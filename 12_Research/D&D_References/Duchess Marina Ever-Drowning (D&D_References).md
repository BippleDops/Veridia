The last surviving member of the Selenthian Dynasty, Marina has died by drowning 777 times, each death making her more powerful and less human. She controls the memory trade in Aquabyssos, literally buying and selling experiences, identities, and histories. Her merchant empire spans both underwater and surface operations through countless agents who don't know they work for her. ## Abilities & Stats

Notable memories in her vault:
- The last sunset before the first drowning
- A god's first doubt
- The moment the Crown of Stars was conceived
- Every mother's final goodbye to drowned children
- The taste of air to the newly transformed ## Plot Hooks

1. Hiring party to retrieve specific surface noble's memory
2. Needs protection during her 900th drowning ritual
3. Offers valuable information in exchange for childhood memories
4. Someone is stealing from her memory vaults ## Court Etiquette


Visitors must observe:
- Never acknowledge the drowning
- Address her by pre-drowning titles
- Bring memories as tribute
- Dance at least once (while drowning)
- Never mention the number 1000 ## DM Notes

Marina represents the desperate clinging to humanity while embracing monstrous transformation. She's a tragic figure who uses commerce and etiquette to maintain sanity. Her memory manipulation makes her incredibly dangerous for information-based campaigns. She should feel like a decadent noble playing elaborate games while drowning eternally. Her connection to surface operations makes her a perfect bridge between Aquabyssos and Aethermoor plots. The countdown to her 1000th drowning creates timeline pressure. ## Player-Facing Summary Duchess Marina Ever Drowning is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Duchess Marina Ever Drowning as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Duchess Marina Ever Drowning. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[Quest - The Crown Reborn]]
