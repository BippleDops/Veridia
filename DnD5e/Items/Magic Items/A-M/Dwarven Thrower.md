## Description
You gain a +3 bonus to [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] and damage rolls made with this [[Magic Weapon|magic weapon]]. It has the Thrown property with a normalrange of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra `dice: 1d8` (1d8) damage or, if the target is a giant, `dice: 2d8` (2d8) damage. Immediately after the attack, the weapon flies back to your hand.

**Thrown.** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
