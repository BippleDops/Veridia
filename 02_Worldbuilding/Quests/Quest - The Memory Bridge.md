# Quest - The Memory Bridge
*Connecting Minds Across Realms*

## Overview
A groundbreaking experiment to create a "memory bridge" between [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] has reached a critical juncture. By combining crystal-enhanced communication technology with Aquabyssos memory-sharing techniques, researchers hope to enable people from both realms to share experiences and understanding directly. However, the project faces sabotage, political opposition, and unexpected side effects that threaten to create dangerous psychic contamination.

## Background
### The Memory Bridge Project
- Joint research initiative between [[The Liminal Trading Company]] and [[The Shadow-Crystal Synthesis]]
- Goal: Create permanent psychic connection allowing cross-realm empathy and understanding
- Method: Crystal amplification of memory-sharing techniques from [[Memory Meadows]]
- Hope: Reduce inter-realm tensions through shared experience and mutual understanding
- Problem: Multiple factions oppose the project for different reasons

### Current Situation
