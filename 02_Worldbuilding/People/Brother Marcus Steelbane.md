Born **Marcus Ironwright** in the Forge District, he was destined to follow his father's trade until a terrible accident at age 19. A crystal-enhanced furnace exploded, leaving him scarred and his father dead. In his grief and pain, Marcus was drawn to the [[02 Worldbuilding/Groups/Order of the Crystal Flame|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/Order Of The Crystal Flame]], where he found peace and purpose. He took the name "Steelbane" to honor his past while embracing his new calling as a warrior against corruption.

*"Strength without discipline is destruction. Discipline without compassion is cruelty. Balance all things."*

*"Brother, we are all scarred metal. The question is whether we let those scars make us brittle or stronger."*
