# The Tidal Council

*"As the tides turn, so must governance adapt to changing currents." - Tidemaster Elena*

## Overview
The Tidal Council serves as Aquabyssos's environmental and maritime regulatory body, managing the complex interactions between the city's needs and the ocean's natural cycles. They coordinate tidal predictions, water current management, and environmental protection while balancing competing interests.

**Navigation Safety:** Managing shipping lanes and hazard warnings
**Environmental Protection:** Preserving marine ecosystems
**Resource Allocation:** Distributing water-based resources fairly
**Emergency Response:** Coordinating disaster relief during tidal events
**Harbor Management:** Overseeing port operations and dock maintenance

## Council Structure
**Tidemaster:** Chief coordinator (currently Elena Deepcurrent)
**Current Readers:** Specialists monitoring water flow patterns
**Marine Biologists:** Experts on ecosystem health and creature behavior
**Harbor Representatives:** Delegates from major port districts
**Environmental Advocates:** Members protecting natural resources
**Emergency Coordinators:** Disaster response specialists

## Current Challenges
- Increasing unpredictability in traditional tidal patterns
- Pollution affecting marine life and water quality

- Questions about scientific accuracy of some predictions
- Political appointments allegedly compromising expertise

## Adventure Hooks
1. Council requests investigation into mysterious tidal anomalies
2. Environmental disaster requires emergency response coordination
3. Political intrigue surrounding controversial development project
4. Ancient maritime curse affecting tidal patterns needs resolution
5. Smuggling operation exploiting tidal prediction information
6. Diplomatic mission to negotiate international water usage agreements

## Resources
**Research Facilities:** Advanced laboratories for marine studies
**Observation Network:** Monitoring stations throughout region
**Emergency Fleet:** Specialized vessels for disaster response
**Information Archives:** Comprehensive historical records
**Scientific Equipment:** Advanced tools for environmental measurement

## DM Notes
The Tidal Council provides excellent opportunities for environmental adventures, political intrigue, and maritime challenges. Use them as quest givers for ocean-based missions or obstacles when party actions conflict with environmental regulations.
