# Death Pact (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *9th-level*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

## Effects
You make a pact with your deity or pa-tron to protect the life on a single target of your choice. This pact ensures that the target will survive an untimely death. You must cast this spell in an area which has been sanc-tified to your deity, and you must perma-nently sacrifice 10 hit points.

Should that target die due to combat, spell, or accident, the target’s remains are instantly transported back to the sanctuary where you cast this spell and the creature will be brought back to life, whole and intact—any missing limbs will be restored and all conditions and enchantments will be re-moved. Furthermore, all but 10 of the crea-ture’s hit points will be restored; those hit points will be permanently lost as a sacrifice.
