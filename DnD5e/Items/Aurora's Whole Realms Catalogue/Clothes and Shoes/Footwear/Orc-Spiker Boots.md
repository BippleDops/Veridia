## Description
These interesting boots have been asked for lately, and now, here they are. You get your basic high or low hard boot, but with a socket at the toe, for attachments. These cost 5 gp a pair, whether you opt for high or low, and weâ€™ll throw in a pair of basic piercing stiletto attachments, free. All other attachments cost 3 gp/pair, and include most of the same blades one can find on pole arms.

## Additional Details
Damage done by these weapons is 1 less than for the normal weapon type damage, but always at least 1 point.
