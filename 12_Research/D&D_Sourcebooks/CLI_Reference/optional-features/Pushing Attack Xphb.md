--- # Pushing Attack

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 95* When you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon or an [[Unarmed Strike Xphb]], you can expend one Superiority Die to attempt to drive the target back. Add the Superiority Die to the attack's damage roll. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet directly away from you.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of pushing attack xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around pushing attack xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
