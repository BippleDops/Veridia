# Beast Master Krell Chainbreaker

*"Every creature has a price, and I know how to make them pay it."*

## Overview
Krell Chainbreaker is a notorious beast master who operates in the outer districts of Aquabyssos, capturing and training dangerous sea creatures for various illegal purposes. His brutal methods and lack of regard for creature welfare have made him feared throughout the criminal underworld.

Once a legitimate marine biologist, Krell's descent into criminality began after losing his research position due to unethical experimentation. Now he uses his expertise to create living weapons and exotic pets for wealthy clients.

## Background
Formerly Dr. Krell Marineson, he was expelled from the Aquabyssos Research Institute for conducting illegal experiments on sentient sea life. His obsession with creature control led him to develop brutal training methods that break creatures' wills entirely.

Now he operates from hidden facilities in abandoned kelp farms, where the screams of tortured creatures echo through the water. His client list includes assassins, gladiator promoters, and wealthy collectors who want "unique" pets.

## Current Activities
