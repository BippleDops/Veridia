## Description

Morteus Grieveheart appears as a figure carved from living sorrow. His deep merfolk heritage shows in his elongated form and pale, almost translucent skin that seems to absorb light rather than reflect it. Standing 6'2" with an ethereal, gaunt frame, he moves with the slow, measured pace of one who has witnessed countless deaths.

His most striking features are his eyes—completely black voids that seem to contain the collected tears of every soul he has "comforted" in their final moments. His hair flows like dark water, occasionally revealing glimpses of the many mourning symbols braided within. Intricate tattoos of funeral rites spiral across his arms and chest, each one representing a different culture's approach to death and grief.

Morteus dwells in the Grief Gardens, a haunted grove where the water itself seems to weep. Here, surrounded by monuments to the dead and tended by his undead servants, he offers his services to those seeking to commune with lost loved ones—for a price that extends far beyond mere coin.

## Equipment

- **Staff of the Grave** (necromantic focus that can trap souls temporarily)
- **Robes of the Grave** (+3 AC, resistance to necrotic damage, command undead)
- **Amulet of Sorrow** (stores emotional pain to fuel spells)
- **Ring of Death Ward** (automatic *death ward* when reduced to 0 hp, 1/day)
- **Tome of Funeral Rites** (contains rituals from 100 different cultures)
- **Vial of Tears** (component pouch containing essences of grief)

## Relationships

**Allies:**
- **[[The Parasite Priests]]** - His order of death-worshippers who serve the cycle of entropy
- **[[Shadow Parliament]]** - They appreciate his ability to silence opposition permanently
- **[[The Biomancers]]** - Trade information about life and death magic
- **Widow's Circle** - A secret society of grieving nobles who seek his services

**Enemies:**
- **[[High Priestess Scylla Deepdream]]** - Views his practices as perversions of natural death
- **[[The Waking Prophets]]** - His undead interfere with their communion with the living
- **The Resurrection Cult** - Fanatics who believe death should always be reversed
- **Life Domain Clerics** - See him as an abomination to be destroyed

**Complicated:**
- **[[Emperor Thalassius the Wise]]** - Officially condemns him but secretly uses his services
- **[[Prince Caspian Duskwater]]** - Morteus knows dark secrets about the prince's family
- **[[Memory Merchant Valeria Siltweave]]** - They compete for contracts involving the recently deceased

## Quest Hooks

1. **The Forbidden Resurrection** - A noble family hires the party to convince Morteus to raise their heir, but he refuses, claiming the soul "belongs to something else now." Investigation reveals the heir made a pact with fiends before death.

2. **The Grief Plague** - Morteus's experiments with concentrated sorrow have created a supernatural plague that makes people die of sadness. He needs help containing it before it spreads beyond Aquabyssos.

3. **The Soul Garden** - Morteus offers to trade information about a villain's weakness in exchange for the party helping him "harvest" souls from a recent battlefield for his research.

4. **The Last Confession** - A dying emperor's final words were spoken only to Morteus. Multiple factions seek the party's help in extracting this information, while Morteus claims professional confidentiality.

5. **The Mourning War** - Two noble houses are using Morteus's services to weaponize their ancestral ghosts against each other. The party must stop the escalating supernatural conflict before it tears Aquabyssos apart.

## Secrets

- **The First Death**: Morteus was once a healer who accidentally caused a patient's death. His grief was so profound it attracted the attention of death entities who offered him power.
- **The Soul Tax**: Every resurrection he performs costs him a piece of his own soul. He's dangerously close to becoming undead himself.
- **The Emperor's Secret**: He knows that [[Emperor Thalassius the Wise]] died three years ago and has been maintaining an elaborate illusion to hide this fact.
- **The Grief Engine**: Deep beneath his gardens lies a massive necromantic device that converts sorrow into raw magical energy, powered by the tears of the bereaved.
- **The Final Service**: He has prepared his own funeral rites and knows exactly when and how he will die—information he guards more carefully than any other secret.

## Motivations

**Primary**: Understand and master the relationship between grief and death
**Secondary**: Provide "comfort" to the bereaved while advancing his necromantic research
**Hidden**: Prevent his own prophesied transformation into a lich by finding a worthy successor

## Roleplaying Notes

**Personality**: Speaks in measured, funeral tones with genuine compassion for the grieving, but views death as a fascinating subject to study rather than a tragedy.

**Ideals**: "Death is not the end—it is merely a transition. Those who understand this truth can find peace, even in the depths of sorrow."

**Bonds**: "Every soul that passes through my care teaches me something new about the nature of mortality and the afterlife."

**Flaws**: "I have become so fascinated by death that I sometimes forget the value of life. My pursuit of necromantic knowledge may damn not just myself, but all who trust me."

**Voice**: Speaks in a soft, hypnotic whisper that somehow carries clearly underwater. His words are carefully chosen and often sound like funeral orations or religious benedictions.

**Speaking Patterns**: 
- "In death, all things find their true purpose..."
- "The living fear what they do not understand..."
- "Grief is but love with nowhere to go..."
- "Let me ease your suffering—there are ways to speak with the departed..."

**Mannerisms**: Always maintains perfect posture, as if conducting a funeral service. His hands move in subtle blessing gestures when he speaks. He has a habit of touching mourning jewelry worn by others, claiming he can sense the grief contained within. Water around him becomes still and dark, reflecting his emotional state.
