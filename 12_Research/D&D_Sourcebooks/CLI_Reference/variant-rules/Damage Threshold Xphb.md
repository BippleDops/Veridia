# Damage Threshold
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 364. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A creature or an object that has a damage threshold has [[immunity-xphb (variant-rules)]] to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes that entire instance of damage. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the damage threshold is superficial and doesn't reduce [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]]. For example, if an object has a damage threshold of 10, the object takes no damage if 9 damage is dealt to it, since that damage fails to exceed the threshold. If the same object is dealt 11 damage, it takes all of that damage.
