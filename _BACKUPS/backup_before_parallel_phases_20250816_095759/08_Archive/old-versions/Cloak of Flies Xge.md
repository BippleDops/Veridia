--- # Cloak of Flies

*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 56* **Prerequisite**: Level 5 As a bonus action, you can surround yourself with a magical aura that looks like buzzing flies. The aura extends 5 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover. It lasts until you're [[conditions#Incapacitated|incapacitated or you dismiss it as a bonus action. The aura grants you advantage on Charisma ([skills#Intimidation|Intimidation]]) checks but disadvantage on all other Charisma checks. Any other creature that starts its turn in the aura takes poison damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 0 damage). Once you use this invocation, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Cloak of flies xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
