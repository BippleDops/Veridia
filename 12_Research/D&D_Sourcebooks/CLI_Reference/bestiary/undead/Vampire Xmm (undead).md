*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 317. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* Vampires are terrifying hunters and manipulators. They use their powers to shape-shift and bend other creatures' wills as they terrorize and feed on populations over generations. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Vampires *Blood-Sucking Lords of the Night* - **Habitat.** Underdark, Urban - **Treasure.** Any Vampires disguise their accursed, immortal natures, passing as mortals to feed on the blood of the living.

Undead vampires lie dormant during the day, retreating to resting places hidden from foes and the sun's searing rays. Roll on or choose a result from the Vampire Resting Places table to inspire a vampire's grim sanctuary. **Vampire Resting Places**`dice: [](vampire-xmm.md#^vampire-resting-places)`| dice: 1d6 | The Vampire's Resting Place Is... |

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of vampire xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around vampire xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The First Prophecy of Shadows ## Plot Hooks - A corpse reveals ancient history about this place
