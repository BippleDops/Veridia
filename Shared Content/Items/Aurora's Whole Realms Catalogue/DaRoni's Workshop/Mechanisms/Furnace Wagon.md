## Description
A man sees an ox and knows it has greater strength than he, but lesser wisdom. He uses wisdom to put his burden on the ox. Even more powerful than the ox is the elementsearth, air, fire, and water. The elements support the ox and the man. Man is far wiser than the elements. So I try to make a wagon to put the burden of man on the elements. 

My furnace wagon (150 gp) has a hot fire on it stoked by coal and a man. The fires heat pushes the air through the shaft and turns the fan blades. The fans are geared low so they turn many times to move the wheel a little. Works very well down hills.
