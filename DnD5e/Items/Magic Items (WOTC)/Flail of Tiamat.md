**Rarity:** legendary

**Attunement**: *requires attunement*

**Damage:** 1d8 bludgeoning

## Description

This magic flail is made in the image of Tiamat, with five jagged heads shaped like the heads of five different chromatic dragons. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this flail. When you hit with an attack roll using it, the target takes an extra `dice: 5d4` damage of your choice of one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.

While holding the flail, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause the heads to breathe multicolored flames in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes `dice: 14d6` damage of one of the following damage types (your choice): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage. Once this action is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
