## Overview
The Purist Coalition Thugs represent the militant arm of [[Aethermoor's anti-crystal corruption movement, believing that the widespread use of [Aether Crystals|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aether Crystals]] is slowly poisoning both the land and its people. What began as a legitimate philosophical movement questioning magical dependence has evolved into a violent extremist organization that uses terrorism, sabotage, and assassination to "purify" the kingdom from crystal influence. They see themselves as freedom fighters saving civilization from magical addiction, but their methods often harm innocent civilians caught between ideology and pragmatism.

### The Great Awakening (75 Years Ago)
**Recognition of the Threat**
- Founded by [[Brother Marcus Steelbane, a former crystal miner who witnessed corruption firsthand
- Initial movement focused on education about crystal addiction dangers
- Documented cases of crystal sickness and magical dependency syndrome
- Established support groups for those seeking to reduce magical reliance
- Published "The Natural Path" manifesto outlining philosophy

### The Radicalization (50 Years Ago)
**From Philosophy to Violence**
- Frustrated by government inaction on crystal regulation
- Witnessed [The Silverscale Consortium|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/The Silverscale Consortium]] suppression of anti-crystal research
- First violent incident: bombing of crystal refinery killing 12 workers
- Split from mainstream anti-crystal movement
- Adopted cell-based organization structure for security

### The Underground War (25 Years Ago)
**Peak Militant Activity**
- Coordinated attacks across multiple crystal facilities
- Assassinated three prominent crystal researchers
- Developed "Crystal Bane" alchemical compounds to neutralize magical effects
- Infiltrated government positions to access crystal distribution networks
- Created martyr culture around "pure sacrifice" for the cause

### Modern Extremism (Last 10 Years)
**Evolution and Desperation**
- Increasingly isolated from mainstream society
- Adopted more extreme interpretations of original philosophy
- Began targeting civilians using crystal-enhanced items
- Formed alliances with other anti-establishment groups
- Planning major operation to "awaken" the kingdom to crystal dangers

### Leadership Council
**The Pure Circle**
- **Supreme Purifier**: [[Purifier Marcus Steelbane - Founding leader and ideological guide
- **War Chief**: [Commander Elena Crystalbreaker]] - Military operations coordinator
- **Truth Speaker**: [[Prophet Sarah Naturalborn - Propaganda and recruitment
- **Shadow Hand**: [Agent Viktor Cleanslate]] - Intelligence and infiltration
- **Resource Keeper**: [[Quartermaster David Simpleton - Logistics and supply management
- **Cell Coordinator**: [Network Master Thomas Nobody]] - Operational security

#### Strike Teams
**Direct Action Units**
- **Crystal Breakers**: Specialized in destroying magical infrastructure
- **Purifier Squads**: Assassination teams targeting "corruption enablers"
- **Sabotage Cells**: Infrastructure disruption and economic warfare
- **Cleansing Units**: Forced "treatment" of crystal-dependent individuals
- **Martyr Brigade**: Suicide attackers for high-impact operations

#### Support Network
**Infrastructure and Resources**
- **Safe House Network**: Hidden locations for operatives and planning
- **Supply Chain**: Weapons, alchemical compounds, and equipment procurement
- **Intelligence Division**: Information gathering and target identification
- **Recruitment Wing**: New member identification and indoctrination
- **Medical Corps**: Treatment for crystal addiction and combat injuries

#### Public Face
**Propaganda and Legitimacy**
- **Education Committee**: Spreading awareness of crystal dangers
- **Legal Defense Fund**: Supporting arrested coalition members
- **Family Services**: Caring for dependents of imprisoned or killed operatives
- **Research Division**: Documenting evidence of crystal harm
- **Political Wing**: Attempting to work within system (minimal influence)

### Active Campaigns

2. **Operation Awakening**: Mass education campaign about crystal dangers
3. **The Pure Hunt**: Targeted assassination of key crystal industry figures
4. **Supply Chain Disruption**: Attacks on crystal transportation and storage
5. **Recruitment Drive**: Expanding membership among crystal addiction victims

### Core Principles
1. **Natural Purity**: Human society should function without magical enhancement
2. **Crystal Corruption**: Magic use inevitably leads to physical and spiritual decay
3. **Economic Exploitation**: Crystal industry deliberately creates addiction for profit
4. **Government Complicity**: Authorities are either corrupted or intimidated into compliance
5. **Necessary Violence**: Peaceful resistance has failed, justifying extreme measures

### The Pure Philosophy
**Fundamental Tenets**
- Magic is unnatural and corrupts everything it touches
- Crystal dependence is slavery disguised as convenience
- Only by purging magical influence can humanity reach true potential
- Individual sacrifice is justified to save civilization
- The corrupt system cannot be reformed, only replaced

### Extremist Interpretations
**Dangerous Beliefs**
- Anyone profiting from crystal trade deserves death
- Crystal users are willing slaves who must be "liberated"
- Collateral damage is acceptable if it serves the greater good
- Compromise with magical society is betrayal of pure principles
- The end of magical civilization justifies any means

### Investigation & Infiltration
1. **The Mole Hunt**: Party must identify coalition infiltrator in government
2. **Safe House Raid**: Track down and capture coalition cell before major attack
3. **The Double Agent**: Coalition member wants to defect with crucial information
4. **Propaganda Investigation**: Discover who's funding coalition recruitment materials
5. **The Missing Shipment**: Crystal cargo disappears, coalition suspected

### Moral Dilemmas
1. **The True Believer**: Coalition member genuinely believes they're saving lives
2. **Collateral Damage**: Prevent coalition attack that would harm innocent civilians
3. **The Crystal Addict**: Help someone caught between coalition and dependency
4. **Sympathizer's Dilemma**: NPC ally has connections to coalition ideology
5. **The Lesser Evil**: Coalition might be right about specific crystal dangers

### Action & Combat
1. **Facility Defense**: Protect crystal installation from coalition attack
2. **The Assassination Plot**: Stop coalition hit squad targeting key figure
3. **Hostage Situation**: Negotiate with coalition terrorists holding civilians
4. **The Bombing Plot**: Discover and disarm coalition explosives before detonation
