# Abyssos Prime - The Drowned Throne
## Former Capital of the Surface World

> *"Where water flows upward and shadows rule the light"*

## Overview

Abyssos Prime, once the glorious capital of Thalassopolis, now exists as a haunted metropolis of coral-covered spires and bioluminescent decay. The city exists in multiple phases of reality simultaneouslyâ€”visitors might walk through a grand ballroom only to find themselves in its ruined future or glorious past.

### Key Statistics
- **Depth Range:** 1,000-3,000 feet below surface
- **Population:** ~2 million transformed souls
- **Government:** The Eternal Senate (undead parliament)
- **Pressure Zone:** Crush Zone (DC 14-16)
- **Time Distortion:** 0.85x (slower than surface)

## Districts & Sub-Locations

### The Inverse Palace
**[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Inverse Palace|Full Details]]**
The seat of the Scattered Emperor, where gravity works backward and water flows upward. The palace exists in a constant state of drowning, frozen at the moment of catastrophe.

**Key Features:**
- Throne of Bubbles - Emperor's court
- Gallery of Frozen Waves - Time-locked tsunamis
- Inverted Ballroom - Ceiling dancers
- Seven Scattered Chambers - Emperor's split personality rooms

### Parliament of Echoes
**[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Parliament of Echoes|Full Details]]**
Where ghost senators debate laws that apply to no one, divided into factions that no longer remember their original purposes.

- The Returners (surface reclaimers)
- The Deepeners (depth supremacists)
- The Forgotten (amnesiacs)

### The Screaming Gardens
**[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Screaming Gardens|Full Details]]**
Crystallized forests grown from the screams of drowning children. When the current flows through them, they play haunting melodies that warn of danger.
