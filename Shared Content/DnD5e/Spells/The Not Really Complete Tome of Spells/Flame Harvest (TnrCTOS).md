# Flame Harvest (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 hour

**Range**: Self (90-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 month


## Effects
You walk around a copse of trees, a field, or another flammable area for an hour, lay-ing a magical trap. Afterwards, you set a specific condition that will spring the trap.

When these conditions are met, the area will burst into flames. All creatures within the area who were unaware of the trap take 10d8 fire damage. Creatures who were aware of the trap (which is only detectable through magic) may make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d8 fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.

After the initial blast, the fire will burn normally, inflicting 1d8 fire damage to any creature that ends its turn in the area, until it burns itself out.
