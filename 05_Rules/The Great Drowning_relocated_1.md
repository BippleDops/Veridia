## Overview

The Great Drowning marks both a physical location and a temporal scar in the fabric of Aquabyssosâ€”the epicenter where the ancient city of Thalassopolis was consumed by an uncontrolled planar breach 847 years ago. Now a massive whirlpool spanning three miles in diameter, it serves as both a memorial to the 300,000 souls lost and a persistent reminder of the dangers of unchecked magical experimentation.

The site pulses with residual planar energy, creating unpredictable currents that can transport unwary travelers through space and [[Time]]. The Abyssal Senate maintains a permanent garrison here, both to prevent access to the depths where Thalassopolis's ruins lie and to monitor the strange phenomena that continue to manifest.

### The Maelstrom

The Great Drowning appears as a colossal whirlpool that defies natural physics:
- **Diameter**: 3.2 miles at the surface, narrowing to 500 feet at the Event Horizon (1,000 feet down)
- **Depth**: Unknownâ€”expeditions have descended 5 miles without reaching bottom
- **Current Speed**: Varies from 5-50 knots in unpredictable patterns
- **Water Temperature**: Fluctuates between near-freezing and boiling without warning

### The Memory Rings

Concentric zones of crystallized water orbit the maelstrom at various depths:
- **First Ring** (100-200 feet): Contains echoes of the final day
- **Second Ring** (300-500 feet): Preserves fragments of daily life
- **Third Ring** (700-900 feet): Holds the screams of [[The Drowning]]
- **Fourth Ring** (1,200+ feet): Unknown contentsâ€”all who enter never return

### The Temporal Distortion Field

Time flows differently near the Great Drowning:
- **Outer Edge**: 1 hour = 61 minutes external time
- **Middle Zone**: 1 hour = 2 hours external time  
- **Inner Spiral**: 1 hour = 1 day external time
- **Event Horizon**: Time becomes non-linear

### The Thalassopolis Experiment (Year 2177)

The mage-council of Thalassopolis attempted to create a permanent portal to the Elemental Plane of Water to solve the city's expansion needs. Led by Archmagus Nereon the Profound, thirteen archmages combined their power in a ritual that had taken decades to prepare.

### The Breach (Day of Sorrow)

On the 13th day of the Tide Month, the ritual went catastrophically wrong:
1. **Hour 1**: Portal opened successfully, celebration began
2. **Hour 3**: Portal began expanding beyond containment circles
3. **Hour 5**: First buildings pulled into the vortex
4. **Hour 7**: Evacuation orders givenâ€”too late for inner districts
5. **Hour 13**: City's reality anchors failed
6. **Hour 19**: Thalassopolis completely submerged
7. **Hour 24**: Planar breach stabilized into current maelstrom

### The Depth Guard

**Commander**: Captain Theron Voidwatcher
- **Force Size**: 200 elite soldiers
- **Rotation**: 3-month tours (longer causes madness)
- **Equipment**: Pressure-resistant armor, reality anchors
- **Mission**: Prevent access, monitor phenomena, rescue the lost

**Depth Guard Veteran** (CR 7)
*Medium humanoid (any race), lawful neutral*

**Armor Class** 17 (pressure armor)
**Hit Points** 78 (12d8 + 24)
**Speed** 30 ft., swim 30 ft.

STR 16 (+3), DEX 14 (+2), CON 14 (+2), INT 12 (+1), WIS 15 (+2), CHA 11 (+0)

**Saving Throws** Str +6, Con +5, Wis +5
**Skills** Athletics +6, Perception +5, Survival +5
**Damage Resistances** psychic
**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 15
**Languages** Common, Aquan, Deep Speech
**Challenge** 7 (2,900 XP)

**Depth Training.** The guard has advantage on saving throws against madness and temporal effects.

**Reality Anchor.** The guard cannot be teleported or plane shifted against their will.

**Actions**
**Multiattack.** The guard makes three trident attacks.

**Pressure Trident.** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 ([[2d6]] + 3) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) force damage.

**Depth Charge (Recharge 5-6).** The guard throws an explosive that detonates in water. Each creature within 20 feet must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 28 ([[8d6]]) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

### The Echo Shepherds

Mysterious beings that emerged from the maelstrom, appearing as translucent humanoids:
- Guide lost souls through the memory rings
- Speak only in quotes from the dead
- Cannot be harmed by physical means
- Disappear if brought more than a mile from the site

### The Remts

Survivors of Thalassopolis transformed by the planar energies:
- No longer fully humanâ€”part water elemental
- Retain fragments of their former memories
- Cannot leave the area without dissolving
- Trade information for offerings thrown into the maelstrom

**Remt of Thalassopolis** (CR 5)
*Medium elemental, neutral*

**Armor Class** 14 (natural armor)
**Hit Points** 68 (8d8 + 32)
**Speed** 20 ft., swim 60 ft.

STR 14 (+2), DEX 16 (+3), CON 18 (+4), INT 11 (+0), WIS 13 (+1), CHA 15 (+2)

**Damage Resistances** acid, fire; bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks
**Damage Immunities** poison
**Condition Immunities** [[Exhaustion]], grappled, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, unconscious
**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11
**Languages** Aquan, Common (fragmented)
**Challenge** 5 (1,800 XP)

**Fragmented Memory.** The remt has [[Disadvantage]] on Intelligence checks but advantage on saving throws against being charmed.

**Water Form.** The remt can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

**Actions**
**Multiattack.** The remt makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.

**Memory Flood (Recharge 5-6).** The remt forces a target within 30 feet to experience fragments of Thalassopolis's destruction. The target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute as they experience the memories. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### The Archive Stones

Thirteen massive obsidian pillars that orbit the maelstrom:
- Each contains the final thoughts of one of the thirteen archmages
- Reading them requires a DC 20 Arcana check
- Success grants insight but forces a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15) or gain a form of indefinite madness
- Destroying one might weaken the maelstromâ€”or make it worse

### The Tide Calendar

A temporal anomaly where past, present, and future overlap:
- Visitors might encounter their future selves
- Messages can be left for the past
- Deaths here echo through time
- Used by [[Oracle]]s to glimpse possible futures

### [[The Sorrow Gardens]]

Crystallized tears of the victims form underwater gardens:
- Each crystal contains a victim's last memory
- Touching one allows experiencing that memory
- Some crystals grant knowledge or skills temporarily
- Others inflict curses or madness

## [[Random Encounter|[[Random Encounter]]s]] (d20)

| Roll | Encounter |
|------|-----------|
| 1-2 | Depth Guard patrol investigating disturbance |
| 3-4 | Echo Shepherd leading phantom procession |
| 5-6 | Remt seeking news of descendants |
| 7-8 | Time loopâ€”party encounters themselves from 1 hour ago |
| 9-10 | Memory crystal storm (1d6 psychic damage per round) |
| 11-12 | Planar rift opens briefly to Elemental Plane of Water |
| 13-14 | Ghost ship from Thalassopolis emerges, crew unaware they're dead |
| 15-16 | [[Temporal Echo]] of the original catastrophe (illusion) |
| 17-18 | [[Deep Mother Cult]]ists attempting ritual |
| 19 | Future version of party member warning of danger |
| 20 | Archive Stone activates spontaneously |

### The Thirteenth Hour

[[The Party]] must enter the maelstrom during a specific temporal alignment to retrieve an artifact from Thalassopolis before the city's destruction. They have exactly 13 hours of subjective time, but each hour deeper they go, the harder it becomes to return.

### The Last Archmage

Intelligence suggests one of the thirteen archmages survived, transformed into something else entirely. They hide in the deepest parts of the ruins, and might hold the key to either closing the breach forever or controlling it.

### Memory Thieves

Someone is harvesting the [[Memory Crystals]] from the Sorrow Gardens and selling them on the black market. The Depth Guard needs investigators who can navigate both the physical dangers and the political implications.

### The Other Side

A message in a bottle emerges from the maelstrom claiming to be from survivors who passed through to another realm. It includes instructions for a ritual to open a stable gateway, but requires components that are themselves dangerous to obtain.

### Temporal [[Assassin]]ation

The party discovers [[Evidence]] of someone using the Tide Calendar to send assassins into the past to eliminate key figures. They must navigate the temporal streams to prevent changes to historyâ€”or decide if some changes might be for the better.

### [[Memory Pearls]]

Crystallized memories that can be consumed to gain temporary benefits:
- **Common** (100 gp): Gain proficiency in one skill for 24 hours
- **Uncommon** (500 gp): Gain expertise in one skill for 24 hours
- **Rare** (2,500 gp): Gain a feat for 24 hours
- **Very Rare** (10,000 gp): Gain a class feature for 24 hours
- **Legendary** (50,000 gp): Gain complete memories of another person permanently

### Temporal Anchors

Devices that protect against time distortion:
- **Minor** (750 gp): Advantage on saves vs temporal effects
- **Major** (7,500 gp): Immunity to time-based attacks
- **Supreme** (75,000 gp): Control personal [[Timeline]]

### Depth Caller's Conch

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This spiral shell constantly drips with water that never runs dry. While attuned:
- You can breathe underwater and have swim speed equal to walking speed
- Once per day, can summon 1d4 Remts of Thalassopolis for 1 hour
- Can hear whispers from the Great Drowning regardless of distance
- Cursed: Must make DC 15 Wisdom save each dawn or be compelled to visit the Great Drowning

### [[Key Locations]]
1. Main entrance/approach
2. Central gathering area
3. Important buildings/features
4. Defensive positions (if applicable)
5. Hidden or secret areas

### Campaign Integration

The Great Drowning serves as:
- A cautionary tale about magical hubris
- A source of temporal plot devices
- A prison for things that should stay buried
- A gateway to other planes or times
- [[The Deep Mother]]'s potential emergence point
