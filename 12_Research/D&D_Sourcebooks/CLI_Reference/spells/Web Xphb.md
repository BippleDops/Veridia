# Web
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point within range. The webs fill a 20-foot [[cube-area-of-effect-xphb|Cube]] there for the duration. The webs are [[difficult-terrain-xphb|Difficult Terrain]], and the area within them is [[lightly-obscured-xphb|Lightly Obscured]].

If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

The first time a creature enters the webs on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition while in the webs or until it breaks free.

A creature [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] by the webs can take an action to make a Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]].

The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot [[cube-area-of-effect-xphb|Cube]] of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing `2d4` Fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

## Player-Facing Summary

Web xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
