# Hometowns
*Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy, p. 8* 

The following four cities and towns can be used for the starting point of a campaign. These cities and towns also work well as locations for adventures or another place to spend all the gold that player characters will likely accumulate. These locations also work well as the lair for the campaign villain.

## Athkatla

- **Population.** 122,000 (90% humans, 8% halflings, 2% other)
- **Government.** Oligarchy, led by the Council of Six
- **Defense.** Amn army
- **Commerce.** Ale, armor, grain, horses, iron, jewelry, weapons
- **Organizations.** Cowled Wizards, Emerald Cabal, Shadow Thieves
- **Religions.** Waukeen (dominant), Helm, Sune, Milil, Selûne, Lathander, Cyric

Athkatla, the City of Coin, is one of the wealthiest cities in all of Faerûn. The capital of the mercantile nation of Amn, nearly every aspect of life in Athkatla revolves money and commerce. Its wealth and affluence are so well known that legends in foreign lands contend the city's streets are literally paved with gold... though if this were true, some enterprising citizens would long ago have found some way to extract the treasures from the cobblestones.

The City of Coin never sleeps—it is constantly abuzz with the haggling and machinations of ruthlessly competitive merchants, peddlers, hustlers, con artists and criminals... though in Amn the lines between these groups is often blurred. In Athkatla, money is power, and there is a stark contrast between those who possess it and those who do not. The influential organizations that run the city's economy—such as the oppressive Cowled Wizards, the enigmatic Shadow Thieves, or the obscenely wealthy mercantile houses—act with unfettered impunity, answering only to themselves. Those who fall on the lower rungs of the social ladder—like the poor who dwell in the slums of the River District—have no recourse to the authorities or the law. For them, life in the City of Coin is a daily struggle to survive where danger lurks around every corner.

Officially, Athkatla is ruled by the Council of Six. Although council positions were once held anonymously, the current council members rule openly, relying on their sponsors to protect them against threats and retaliation from potential rivals. The current council consists of the leader of House Selemchant, backed by the Cowled Wizards; the matriarch of House Dannihyr, supported by the Shadow Thieves; and the rulers of the independent mercantile families of House Alibakkar, House Ophal, House Nashivaar, and House Havarian—the most recent addition to the Council.

### Culture

Status in Athkatla is measured almost exclusively by material wealth. As such, it is common practice for those in power to display their affluence through lavish parties and expensive gifts to allies and supporters. Bribery is commonplace, and widely accepted as the proper way to grease the wheels in business and politics.

The constant effort to demonstrate extravagance surpassing one's peers has led to a culture of Athkatla's citizens embracing decadence and overindulgence, particularly among the elites of the gem district. During nights of revelry it is common practice to eat and drink to the point of bursting, then to forcefully empty the stomach through the practice of "straking"... leaving behind a vomitus mess for their servants or slaves to clean up.

Not surprisingly, fashion in Athkatla also reflects this obsession with material wealth. Women typically wear elaborate turbans made from rare silks, inlaid with gems and embroidered with gold or platinum stitching. Men favor expensive vests and cloaks sewn from valuable furs imported from the distant North, sacrificing personal comfort in the blazing heat in order to show off their means. Ornate jewelry is common among both sexes, with an affinity for custom pieces showcasing rare gems, especially black pearls.

The various ranks of societal status are correlated with precious metals: ranging from the "ore" of the dregs of society to the "mithral" elites at the top.

- **Ore.** The lowest rank. Used to mean filthy or criminal, and strongly insulting.
- **Bronze.** The working class. Can also be used to mean a low-rank imposter.
- **Copper.** Acceptable working class.
- **Steel.** Best of the working class, or military.
- **Silver.** A rising merchant or one with much potential.
- **Gold.** One whose wealth was inherited, or one who was wealthy without business sense.
- **Platinum.** The head of a mercantile house.
- **Adamantine.** The highest self-made rank.
- **Mithral.** Perfection. The highest possible rank.

A common insult is to refer to someone as a low-ranking metal, particularly if it is immediately below their actual station. Referring to someone or something as one of the higher ranks is seen as a compliment... or flattery.

In practice, the richer inhabitants have authority over the less wealthy. However, a recent public show of wealth such as a large purchase, high bid, or particularly extravagant party could temporarily raise an individual's status above those who possess greater total wealth.

Because the societal emphasis is so heavily dependent on measurable material wealth, there is little regard given to racial stereotypes. As long as a potential customer or business partner adheres to the basic societal rules—and has the money to back their position—it does not matter who they are or where they are from.

### History

One of the first major settlements in the region, the city was originally founded circa 100 DR by Calishite immigrants loyal to the Shoon Imperium. The region was first known as the Emirate of Amin, but when the Shoon Empire fell in 460 DR, Amn became an independent nation... though the city of Esmeltaran was its first capital, despite Athkatla being the oldest and largest city.

The next seven centuries were a period of prosperity and peace, driven largely by trade with the distant lands to the North. The rapid rise of the merchant traders led to a culture that valued economic success over all else. The obsession with profit and material wealth eventually became the defining characteristic of Athkatla and its citizens.

In 1238 DR a series of trade wars began as various factions tried to exert control over the city. In 1333 all trade in or out of Amn was halted. Realizing such trade interruptions were harmful to not just the merchant houses, but the entire nation, a young Athkatla merchant named Thayze Selemchant persuaded the leaders of five other influential houses in the city to join together and form a new government to "guide" commerce... and the nation as a whole.

Under the newly formed Council of Six, trade resumed, and profits flowed once more. The Council decreed that Athkatla, home of their Houses, would be the new capital of Amn. Given their economic influence across all levels of society, there were none who dared oppose them. Under the Council, Athkatla flourished, becoming the busiest trade port on the Sword Coast.

### Laws

Law in Athkatla is based on the Golden Rule—those who have the gold make the rules. Actions that would be considered illegal or immoral in other lands are tolerated, providing the offenders are rich enough to pay the pre-determined fines. Lewd and licentious behavior are rampant in the city, slavery is common, and even the thieves within the city are permitted to operate provided they follow the terms of written contracts.

The only real crime in Athkatla—other than being poor—is the use of arcane magic within the city limits. In the 13th Century DR, King Dhanar granted the Cowled Wizards complete oversight over spellcasters. As a result, only a handful of sorcerers are licensed to practice in Athkatla, all exclusively under contract with the various High Houses of Amn. Enforcement of this ban on arcane magic is under the purview of the Cowled Wizards, who administer brutal punishment on any who flout this law. Many of the High Houses now resent this arrangement, as they feel the Cowled Wizards are little more than agents working on behalf of House Selemchant, but the dissenters lack the influence and resources to effectively oppose the status quo.

### Cowled Wizards

A secretive cabal formed in the 13th century DR, they were originally the guardians of arcane knowledge and lore. However, years of monitoring—and controlling—foreign mages visiting the city gradually transformed the organization into a brutal autocratic force with the sole goal of suppressing potential rivals to their station.

Violators of the city wide restrictions on magic face censure, banishment or even death. While the stated goal of the organization is to protect the security of the city and guard against the potential devastation a rogue mage might cause, many individual members of the Cowled Wizards use their position for personal profit and gain. Often this involves cutting secret deals with various parties that are not officially sanctioned by their organization. Despite this, there is little recourse for those who feel they have been treated unjustly by any of the Cowled Wizards, as accusations against them often result in severe retaliation.

The members of the Cowled Wizards act in anonymity, often working publicly as merchants, librarians, apothecaries or other similar professions. The identity of any individual Cowled Wizard is known to their immediate family and—at most—a small circle of other members they work within the organization.

The Cowled Wizards meet in secret in the hidden chambers beneath the city, located under Jane Lane. Wearing masks and the garb of the School of Wonder—an academy destroyed in a series of anti-arcane riots long ago—they are able to hide their identities even from each other as they share information and coordinate their activities.

### Shadow Thieves

One of the most powerful thieves' guilds in western Faerûn is headquartered in Athkatla. Originally operating out of Waterdeep, they were forced to flee the city when the Masked Lady, Lhestyn Arunsun, came to power in 1298 DR and waged a campaign to purge them from her city.

However, their exile from Waterdeep proved to be a boon rather than a bane. In Athkatla, they found a society that allowed them to prosper and thrive, and by the early 14th century they controlled many of the criminal operations up and down the Sword Coast.

The Shadow Thieves are guided by two foundational tenets, written by the first Grandmaster following their exile from Waterdeep.

- "The Shadow Thieves will never again be brought so low and disgraced as they were in their exile."
- "They will take their vengeance upon the city of Waterdeep."

Even though they are an open secret within Athkatla, the Shadow Thieves still prefer to operate discreetly. The Shadow Council that controls the guild understands that secrecy and subtlety are their greatest weapons, and this belief has trickled down through the ranks to every officer, agent and member. The full extent of their convoluted, ambitious machinations are known only to the handful of figures in the upper most echelon, though there are many rumors as to what conspiracies they are involved in. Many of these rumors are, in fact, false narratives planted by the Shadow Thieves themselves to obscure their true goals.

The Shadow Thieves provide many illicit services that the citizens of Athkatla use on a regular basis. Protection rackets are understood as a cost of doing business, and political leaders rely on the Shadow Thieves for protection... and often hire them to spy on or steal from their rivals. Similarly, the merchants of the city rely on the Shadow Thieves to coordinate the sale and distribution of black market goods to smugglers, pirates and various other underworld figures in numerous cities up and down the Sword Coast.

The Guild is known for being as ruthless as they are secretive. Violence is always an option, and in addition to theft and burglary they are also adept in assassination and kidnapping... though prisoners are only taken if they can be ransomed for substantial profit.

The Guild is controlled by an 8-person Shadow Council operating in Athkatla, which is overseen by an individual known as the Grandmaster of Shadows. There are allegations that the Shadow Thieves have some type of alliance/agreement with the Council of Six allowing them to operate with impunity within the city. In truth, the Grandmaster is always a member of the powerful Dannihyr House—a permanent member of the Council of Six. Because of this, the Shadow Thieves have a powerful voice in the politics of the city... though what would happen if the needs of House Dannihyr came into conflict with those of the guild is something that can only be speculated on.

Though the Shadow Thieves have many despised rivals, like the Xanathar Thieves Guild in Waterdeep and the Rundden in Calimshan, their true enemies will forever be the Lords of Waterdeep. Even after more than a century, the Shadow Thieves still harbor a desire for vengeance against the heirs of those who first cast them out of their ancestral home.

#### Shop of the Bizarre

The most powerful items in Athkatla can be found in a shop run by the enigmatic and ruthless neogi. These spider-like monsters are planar travelers that trade in magic items and slaves. Each visit to the shop brings the chance of danger, for sometimes the neogi aren't looking to sell items, but are more interested in acquiring new slaves. When this happens, all of the magical items in the store are illusionary and the neogi have prepared an ambush. For each shopper, there is a neogi and an umber hulk, with a single neogi master leading the ambush. More powerful customers might mean the neogi bring an additional 1d6 gray renders. Item costs are as follows:

## Baldur's Gate

- **Population.** 125,000 (predominantly humans)
- **Government.** Plutocracy, helmed by the Council of Four and Parliament of Peers
- **Defense.** Flaming Fist mercenaries, the Watch
- **Commerce.** Dyes, fish, imports from Chult, mercenaries, nautical supplies
- **Organizations.** The Guild, neighborhood crews, trade guilds
- **Religions.** Gond, Tymora, Umberlee, any other law-abiding faith, cults of the Dead Three

Situated where the Western Heartlands meet the Sword Coast, the city-state of Baldur's Gate is a beacon of civilization in a largely untamed frontier land. Although somewhat small in terms of area, Baldur's Gate population rivals that of the highly regarded and influential Waterdeep to the north.

Because Baldur's Gate is first and foremost a city of trade built around its harbor, the docks remain the true heart of the city. This busy area is the base of operations for many key trade organizations in Faerûn, including the famous mercenary company the Flaming Fist. Even the role of the Gate's leaders, the Council of Four (or the "Grand Dukes"), has mercantile origins and still pulls many of its members from the ranks of successful merchants.

Often simply referred to as "the Gate," especially by its residents—Baldurians, as they're called—Baldur's Gate was founded over 400 years ago. In those days, the settlement now known as Baldur's Gate was little more than a port with a surrounding shanty town. A combination of key historical figures and rapidly changing economic factors did much to shape the city within a relatively short amount of time.

Baldur's Gate is named for perhaps its most famous citizen, the legendary explorer Balduran. With his ship, the Wandering Eye, Balduran and his crew became the first Faerûnians to reach the once-mythical continent of Anchorome after sailing west across the Trackless Sea. After many years, Balduran returned to his home harbor and invested his accumulated wealth in its growth.

In this way, Balduran used the great fortune he amassed during his travels to help the small town that would someday bear his name grow into a major metropolis. His most famous project was the construction of the impressive city walls that helps make Baldur's Gate an island of security within the otherwise dangerous and unpredictable Sword Coast.

After the walls' completion, Balduran set sail one final time with the intention of returning to and further exploring Anchorome. However, he and his crew were never heard from again, their ultimate fates still unknown to this day.

As the years went by, the Gate's rapid growth and increasing prosperity have caught the attention and resentment from wealthy nobles and merchants in Waterdeep and Amn. Although their relationships are strained at times—especially with Amn during the Iron Crisis—this conflict remains a trade rivalry that has never broken out into open war.

Baldur's Gate is surrounded by walls on three sides and the rushing River Chionthar to the south, making the city relatively secure from outside threats. For threats within the city, the Flaming Fist does its best to enforce law and order. However, the city's dense population and thriving economy have made it an ideal place for rogues and thieves to ply their trade. Facilitating such illicit activities is an extensive sewer system and network of subterranean structures. Such hidden passageways allow individuals to move throughout the city away from the prying eyes of more upstanding citizens and Flaming Fist patrols.

Topside, a system of magically powered lanterns keep the city well-lit throughout the night. These lights are at their most dense near the city's major temples, around the Ducal Palace, and by the docks where they promote both safety and productivity in these areas.

Buildings in the Gate generally get newer further away from the harbor, though exceptions can be found where previous structures were torn down for more recent construction in the same lot. The typical style for buildings in the city is towards the tall and narrow, reflecting the fixed amount of area available for development within the walls. However, the Gate is not without urban decay, which is especially common in the Northeast Outskirts, largely considered the slums of the city where only the most destitute make their homes. The northwest represents the opposite side of this coin, containing most of the finer estates belonging to wealthy Baldurians.

Like most aspects of life in Baldur's Gate, its balance of power largely revolves around what the city is mainly known for: commerce. The many trade organizations within the Gate have formed a symbiotic relationship with the Grand Dukes. The Dukes' approval can mean lucrative trade agreements, while strong trade organization support is often necessary for their election. Hired by the Dukes and paid through tariffs and taxes, the Flaming Fist mercenary company enforce the law—while the city's highly organized and equally sizable Thieves' Guild works hard to ply their own trade without getting noticed.

Baldur's Gate has had its fate entwined for more than a century with that of Bhaal, god of murder. Bhaal foresaw that he would die in the Time of Troubles and enacted a plan that would allow him to return to life. While that plan took more than a century to come to fruition, Bhaal has indeed been reborn in the city of Baldur's Gate. Having been dead for more than a century, he now works to rebuild his following and thus strengthen his divine might.

> Baldurs Gate teems with evil and the stinky smell of decay. Perhaps not as stinky as a hamster fart, but a close second for sure.

### The Dukes

Also known as the Council of Four, the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate rule the city and are entrusted with making political decisions to the benefit of its citizens. Each Duke is democratically elected by landowners within the Gate, serving for life or until resignation. Rarely, a Duke who has committed an egregious offense is then stripped of their title. Although anyone can theoretically become a Grand Duke with enough support, they are usually pulled from the ranks of wealthy merchants, renowned military leaders, and famous adventurers. The current Dukes consist of Ulder Ravengard (also commander of the Flaming Fist), Belynne Stelmane and Dillard Portyr. One of the positions has recently become open with the death of duke Thalamra Vanthampur. A newcomer to the city, [Eo Ashmajiir](/compendium/bestiary/npc/eo-ashmajiir-mabjov.md), has been aggressively politicking to be elected to the empty seat.

The first Dukes were directly linked to the port city's nautical past and were entirely made up of retired sea captains. Despite the importance of its port, Baldur's Gate was originally ruled by wealthy farmers. Sailors resented having to pay hefty fees and taxes to use the gates built by their lost colleague, Balduran. They eventually overthrew the farmers, installing the four oldest sea captains as rulers of the Gate. The four were originally called "Grand Dukes" in jest, but the title—now used unironically—has stuck to this day.

The Grand Dukes operate out of the Ducal Palace, also known as the High Hall. One of the tallest buildings in Baldur's Gate, the Ducal Palace acts as an office for everyday decisions, a venue for regal ceremonies, and a suitably luxurious place to entertain politically important individuals visiting the city. The palace also provides sleeping quarters for temporarily displaced nobles and those whose main estates lie outside the city walls. As its name suggests, the Ducal Palace has been built to emulate the residences of more conventional royalty, complete with heavily fortified walls and high towers.

### The Flaming Fist

Founded in 1345 by Duke Eltan in Baldur's Gate, the Flaming Fist Mercenary Company continues to maintain both its headquarters and a strong presence within the city. What began as a consolidation of multiple local mercenary groups has quickly grown over the decades to a force of several thousand soldiers.

The rise of the Flaming Fist indeed resulted in reduced crime in Baldur's Gate and had the unexpected consequence of the city becoming a significant military power. The company continues to receive regular payment from the Dukes, as well as a portion of taxes collected from the harbor and at Wyrm's Crossing.

In addition to the city itself, Flaming Fist patrols enforce law in the immediate area surrounding Baldur's Gate, particularly in larger settlements like Beregost and the Friendly Arm Inn. However, their reach largely ends before Nashkel, which hosts an increasingly strong Amnian military presence.

One of the Flaming Fist's most notable accomplishments was the defeat of Akbet-Khrul, a brutal pirate lord who had terrorized the coast. In this campaign, they aided the Golden Legion, a similar mercenary company located in Amn. However, despite working with Amnian mercenaries, the Flaming Fist's rivalry with Amn as a whole has always caused tension between Baldur's Gate and its southern neighbor.

While the Gate prides itself in remaining politically neutral in external conflicts, its de facto army and police force does not have the same policy. For enough coin, the Flaming Fist is occasionally hired out as muscle for a foreign power. Examples of this include aiding Sembia in its defense against the Grand Army of Tuigan. Another is their activity in Tethyr, an unstable nation currently embroiled in a long civil war. Some claim that agents of the Flaming Fist help to destabilize governments in Faerûn so that their services are always sought after.

Although its headquarters in Baldur's Gate remains its most impressive, the Flaming Fist has built other forts throughout Toril. In 1364, the group established the settlement of Fort Flame on the coast of the newly discovered far-west continent of Maztica. Similar outposts have been founded in Anchorome and Chult.

The Flaming Fist is run like an army. Every group of five fists is led by a manip and a flame. Manips are veteran soldiers who have risen through the ranks while flames are trained knights from a noble or mercantile family. A blaze is put in command of a fort or a mission. The marshal commands the entire Flaming Fist.

#### Sorcerous Sundries

This famed magical shop has had multiple owners over the decades. Currently it is a front for a Red Wizard operation led by Edwin Odeisseron.

However, a successful [Deception](/rules/skills.md#Deception) check at DC 20 can bypass this restriction. The Red Wizards can have a purchased item teleported from Thay within an hour.

## Suldanessellar

- **Population.** 250 (90% elves, 10% other)
- **Government.** Dictatorship ([Jon Irenicus](/compendium/bestiary/npc/jon-irenicus-mabjov.md))
- **Defense.** Undead controlled by [Jon Irenicus](/compendium/bestiary/npc/jon-irenicus-mabjov.md), [wolfweres](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/wolfwere-mabjov.md) controlled by [Bodhi Irenicus](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bodhi-irenicus-mabjov.md)
- **Commerce.** None
- **Organizations.** Order of Icarus, Raven Circle
- **Religions.** Raven Queen

Suldanessellar is an elven city in the Forest of Tethir ruled by Queen Ellesime. It houses the Tree of Life and serves as a meeting place for all of the elvish tribes within the Forest of Tethir, including the Elmanesse elven tribe to the north and the Suldusk elven tribe to the south.

Suldanessellar is all that remains of the ancient elven kingdom of Keltormir. The elves of that ancient kingdom were saved from complete annihilation by the great elven hero Tethir—the inspiration for the name of the forest. A seed given to the elves by their god, Rillifane Rallathil, was planted in the spot of Tethir's death to honor him. This seed quickly grew into the Tree of Life; becoming so massive its branches were able to support the treetop city that would eventually become Suldanessellar.

In current times, Suldanessellar is still recovering from a tragedy that nearly destroyed it a century ago. [Jon Irenicus](/compendium/bestiary/npc/jon-irenicus-mabjov.md), a great elven wizard exiled from the city, tried to use the Tree of Life to complete a ritual that would transform him into a god. With the help of his sister, Bodhi, he captured Queen Ellesime and [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) the Tree of Life. Jon's plan was thwarted when he was killed by the Bhaalspawn, Abdel Adrian.

But Jon's death didn't bring peace to the elves of Suldanessellar. Due to a pact with the Dark Powers of the Shadowfell, his spirit was drawn into a dark reflection of the treetop city. Trapped in this Domain of Dread, Irenicus—with the help of his sister—is still able to inflict misery on the elves of Suldanessellar from his prison.

### The Shadowfell

This dismal echo of Suldanessellar exists in the Shadowfell. This realm is lorded over by the siblings Jon and [Bodhi Irenicus](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bodhi-irenicus-mabjov.md). In their version of the elven city it is always night. The city is as beautiful as its counterpart, except for a few places that have been twisted to reflect the inhabitants, such as the palace where Jon rules and the tower where Bodhi roosts. The former House of the Horn has become a lair for the Shadar-Kai, a twisted race of elves associated with the Raven Queen—the dark ruler of the entire Shadowfell. Finally, the branches on the borders of the city are black and malformed, becoming the domain of bloodthirsty [wolfweres](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/wolfwere-mabjov.md). The branches grow thicker the further one travels, and only with the permission of either Jon or Bodhi will a path open up for someone to escape back into the real world.

Jon and Bodhi lure travelers from across the Forest of Tethir into their cursed domain. They do this by opening pathways in the forest when the moon of Selune is at its fullest. These pathways seem to lead into supernaturally beautiful groves or echo with beautiful fey song. While most of those tricked into the shadow realm are younger elves from the city of Suldanessellar, there are members of almost every race trapped in the elven city's dark reflection.

Those who first arrive find themselves in a place reminiscent to its real-world counterpart. Most of those trapped in the shadow city try to recreate a semblance of a normal life. The majority of the elven population distract themselves with music, dancing under the stars and praying to the Seldarine. For some elves, the despair of the place becomes too much and they either join the Shadar-Kai or wander out into the Black Branches to be torn apart by the [wolfweres](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/wolfwere-mabjov.md).

Jon and Bodhi are always looking for those who can help free them from their prison. They have founded an organization called the Order of Icarus. Members of the Order are the only ones that the siblings allow to leave their realm. Members of the Order seek out magical secrets or capture learned sages or spell casters to bring back to their masters. Bodhi is the one who identifies those who might have the talents required to join the Order, selecting candidates from newly trapped travelers or children who have grown up in the Shadowfell and have just come of age.

The inhabitants of the real world Suldanessellar have been tormented by its dark reflection for the entire century of its existence. When an elf in Suldanessellar goes into their daily trance, they can communicate with the elves trapped in Jon and Bodhi's realm. Those who have loved ones trapped in the shadow realm can become obsessed, spending all of their time conversing with them.

## Ust Natha

- **Population.** 7,500 (80% drow, 5% quaggoth, 5% svirfneblin, 10% other)
- **Government.** Matriarchy/Theocracy (high priestess of Lolth)
- **Defense.** Drow supported by quaggoth
- **Commerce.** Fresh water, poisons, mushrooms, Netherese artifacts, slaves
- **Organizations.** Adventurer's Guild, Shadow Thieves
- **Religions.** Lolth

Ust Natha is a drow city located in the Middledark of the Underdark. Its location corresponds with the southwestern border of Amn and Tethyr on the surface world. The city is small, existing entirely within a single large cavern with most of its living areas built inside of hollowed out stalagmites. Despite its size, it has become a major trading hub between the drow and other races. The city also has historical significance for the drow, as legends claim that Ust Natha is located close to the surface caves where the Ilythiiri dark elves were forced to retreat after losing the fourth Crown war. After many generations, these Ilythiri refugees evolved into the modern day drow.

Ust Natha must contend with several other Underdark settlements in the region, including a kuo-toa city and an illithid enclave. A nearby svirfneblin village is allowed to remain nominally independent as long as they supply a quota of slaves each year. The largest danger to Ust Natha is a recently awakened nest of [phaerimm](/compendium/bestiary/aberration/phaerimm-mabjov.md), located several miles beneath the city itself.

The city is controlled by several competing drow houses, the most powerful of which is the Despana family. While a majority of the city's population are drow, in recent decades the city has allowed a large contingent of foreigners to take residence. This has been at the behest of Phaere Despana, who seeks to raise the fortunes of her house by creating a place within the Underdark where surface traders feel relatively safe. Organizations such as the Shadow Thieves and Zhentarim now have permanent trading establishments within the city. In addition to the drow population and surface traders, there are thousands of quaggoth and svirfneblin slaves that support the drow houses, and even a few Illithid and aboleth envoys can be found within the city.

### House Despana

- **Matron Mother.** Phaere Despana
- **Patron.** Qilue Despana
- **Head Wizard.** Malavon Despana
- **Weapon Master.** Chalinthra Despana

House Despana is a drow noble house with branches in many drow cities of the Underdark. The largest branch is located in Ust Natha, but there are about a half-dozen other branches, including a small house in the city of Menzoberranzan. The house is headed by Matron Mother Phaere Despana, who killed her mother to take over the house more than a century ago. She is aided by a powerful archmage named Malavon, who joined her a few years ago when his branch of Despana was forced out of the drow city of Rilauven.

> [!quote] Carcerus
> 
> This prison is used not only by Ust Natha, but by other drow cities such as Rilauven and Guallidurth; even non-drow cities such as the nearby dwarven city of Iltkazar use the prison on occasion for their worst criminals. It is considered by most Underdark denizens as unescapable and being consigned to the prison a fate worse than death. The reason for this is that it is run by demodands from the infernal plane of Carceri. A portal to the plane of Carceri is even located in its lower depths. Some of the prisoners rumored to be held in the prison include powerful drider, rogue illithid such as Alhoon and even a few specimens of phaerrim. Worst of all, some believe that the demodands keep a small number of [bebilith](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/bebilith-mabjov.md) that they have tortured into serving their needs. These spider-like creatures can unerringly pursue escaped prisoners anywhere across Faerûn.

Some items can always be found at the market. A customer can also spend 100 gp to get a roll on the rare item chart. They may roll a maximum of 5 times per day.

#### Aboleth Bowl

The most powerful items can be found at the aboleth bowl. The aboleth deal in ancient artifacts from civilizations long dead but dealing with them can be dangerous. The wealthier the customer (as displayed by the price of an item they want to purchase), the more likely the aboleth will simply try to take control of the customer and make them a slave. An intimidation roll is required to make the aboleth back down. A failed check means that 1d4 aboleth and one chuul per customer will attack.

> Me and Boo had help writing this chapter. Our helper made us promise never to reveal her name to the world, for such a revelation might damage her reputation. Boo was adamant that we not hurt her good name, for hadn't she suffered enough? Was her goddess, Shar, not a most cruel mistress? Did the bright and shiny sun not hurt her dark elf eyes every day? Boo and I shook hand and paw and swore to each other to never reveal her identity.
