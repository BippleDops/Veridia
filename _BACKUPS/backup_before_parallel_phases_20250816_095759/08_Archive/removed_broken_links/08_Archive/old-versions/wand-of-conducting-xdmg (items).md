*Wand, common* - **Weight**: 1.0 lbs. This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to expend 1 charge and create orchestral music by waving it around. The music can be heard out to 120 feet and ends when you stop waving the wand. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Regaining Charges The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll`d20`. On a 1, a sad tuba sound plays as the wand crumbles into dust and is destroyed. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 319* ## Player-Facing Summary Wand of conducting xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
