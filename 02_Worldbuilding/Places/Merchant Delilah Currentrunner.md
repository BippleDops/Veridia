## Overview

Merchant Delilah Currentrunner operates one of Aquabyssos's most successful independent trading enterprises, specializing in rapid transportation of goods and messages throughout the underwater realm and to surface markets. Her business, "Currentrunner Expedited Services," has built a reputation for delivering anything, anywhere, faster than anyone else in the trade.

Delilah's success comes from her intimate knowledge of ocean currents, her network of reliable contacts, and her willingness to take calculated risks that other merchants avoid. She operates a fleet of specially modified vessels designed for speed and stealth, making her services valuable to both legitimate businesses and those requiring discretion.

As political tensions rise in Aquabyssos, Delilah finds herself in the unique position of being courted by all factions while maintaining her independence. Her transportation network has become increasingly important as official channels become unreliable.

## Appearance

Delilah is a confident [[Triton]] woman in her early forties, with dark blue-green skin marked by intricate tattoos that [[map]] the major ocean currents of the region. Her silver hair is kept in practical braids adorned with small shells and metal tokens from her various business dealings. Her eyes are sharp amber, constantly evaluating opportunities and risks.

She dresses in practical but high-quality clothing designed for both underwater and surface environments, with a distinctive coat made from shark leather that serves as her business trademark. She carries a enchanted conch shell that serves as both a communication device and a symbol of her authority in [[Mari[[Time]] Commerce]].

## Background

Delilah grew up in a family of traditional triton traders but broke away to establish her own business when she became frustrated with the conservative approach of established merchant houses. She spent her twenties exploring new trade routes and building relationships with unconventional clients, gradually developing the speed-focused business model that now defines her enterprise.

Her reputation was cemented five years ago when she successfully delivered critical medical supplies to a remote settlement during a monster attack, navigating dangerous waters that other merchants deemed impossible to traverse.

## Current Activities

Delilah is busier than ever as the political situation in Aquabyssos creates demand for discrete transportation services. She's carefully balancing contracts from different factions while gathering intelligence about the broader implications of the current crisis.

She's also investigating [[reports]] of interference with shipping lanes and suspicious cargo movements that suggest someone is manipulating trade patterns for political purposes.

## Quest Hooks

1. Delilah offers [[The Party]] high-paying transport work, but the cargo attracts unwanted attention from multiple factions.
2. The party needs fast, discrete transportation to reach a critical location, requiring negotiation with Delilah for her services.
3. Attacks on merchant vessels threaten to disrupt Delilah's business, and she needs investigators to identify the perpetrators.

### [[Key Locations]]
1. Main entrance/approach
2. Central gathering area
3. Important buildings/features
4. Defensive positions (if applicable)
5. Hidden or secret areas

## [[DM Notes]]

Delilah serves as both a transportation resource and a source of information about regional trade and politics. Her independent status and diverse client base make her useful for introducing plot complications and opportunities. Use her merchant network to provide information and her vessels for transportation while creating [[Moral Dilemmas]] about the nature of her various clients.
