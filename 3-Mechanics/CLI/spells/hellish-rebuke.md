You point your finger, and the creature that damaged you is momentarily surrounded by hellish flames. The creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes `dice: 2d10|avg|noform` (`2d10`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d10` for each slot level above 1st.
