### Infra-Lantern (Pic)

## Description
This strange device appears to be a normal [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Illuminations/Lanterns/Hooded Lantern|hooded lantern]], but in place of a wick, dancing with a flame, it holds a faceted gem. These gems are pieces of the dweomercraft of the dark elves, and as such will lose their power if they ever are touched by the rays of the sun. A creature or person who sees by way of infravision finds this lantern to be a great boon underground and at night, for it allows him to see with greater clarity by infravision. These infra-[[Lanterns|lanterns]] are fashioned only from extremely rare imported and magical gems, and so I am sorry if your request finds me temporarily out of stock (1700 gp). Infra-[[Lanterns|lanterns]] are nigh useless to beings with normal sight alone, as the vibrations the [[Lanterns|lanterns]] emit cannot be seen at all by them.

## Additional Details
DMs should allow the purchase of infra-[[Lanterns|lanterns]] only if they feel that their campaigns would not be unduly unbalanced by them. An infra-lantern does one of two things, depending on how infravision is handled in a game. If the DM is using standard infravision, then an infra-lantern allows infravision (seeing in the dark) out to 90 feet. If the DM is using optional infravision, where creatures with infravision see heat, then an infra-lantern sharpens the infra-vision and allows greater details to be made out: an orc can be identified as an orc, not a man-sized humanoid, for instance, and objects usually of such a small difference in temperature as to be indistinguishable, like the walls, the floor and a door, can all easily be told apart. It also increases the range of infravision to 70 feet.
