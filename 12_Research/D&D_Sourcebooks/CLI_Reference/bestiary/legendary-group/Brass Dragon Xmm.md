# Brass Dragon

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The area containing an adult or ancient brass dragon's lair is altered by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Mirages.** While in its lair, the dragon can cast [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/major-image-xphb|Major Image]], requiring no Material components and using the same spellcasting ability as its Spellcasting action. When casting the spell this way, the spell's range is 1 mile, and the dragon doesn't need to see the spot where the illusion appears.  
- **Refreshing Water.** Water within 1 mile of the lair is magically refreshing. A creature that drinks such water gains `2d4` [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb|Temporary Hit Points]], and the dragon is immediately aware of the creature's presence.  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
