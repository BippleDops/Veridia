--- # Talisman of the Sphere

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/talisman-of-the-sphere.webp#right) - **Weight**: 1.0 lbs. While holding or wearing this talisman, you have [[Advantage Xphb on any Intelligence ([skills#Arcana|Arcana]]) check you make to control a [[Sphere of Annihilation Xdmg. In addition, when you start your turn in control of a [Sphere of Annihilation Xdmg]], you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to move it 10 feet plus a number of additional feet equal to 10 times your Intelligence modifier. This movement doesn't have to be in a straight line. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 315.
