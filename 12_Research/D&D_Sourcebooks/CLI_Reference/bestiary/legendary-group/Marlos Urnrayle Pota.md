## Lair actions
_Source: Princes of the Apocalypse_

If Marlos is in the earth node while [[ogremoch pota|OgrÃ©moch]] isn't, the medusa can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Marlos uses a lair action to cast [[earthquake xphb|earthquake]] without using components. As long as he maintains [[conditions#Concentration|concentration]] on [[earthquake xphb|earthquake]], initiative count 20 is the start of Marlos's turn for the purpose of the spell. He can take no other lair actions while [[conditions#Concentration|concentrating]] on [[earthquake xphb|earthquake]].

Marlos's second option for a lair action is to draw power from the earth node to heal. When he does so, he regains 30 (`6d8 + 3`) hit points.
