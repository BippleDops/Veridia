You create a three-foot long, glowing amber-brown shark out of magical force. The shark swims with a speed of 60 and attacks one target you can see within range. It uses your spell attack modifier to attack and on a hit, it inflicts 2d6 piercing damage. It will continue to attack the chosen target for as long as you concentrate on it; you may use a bonus action to redirect it to attack a differ-ent creature.

The shark is an object that has AC 16 and 20 hit points. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.
