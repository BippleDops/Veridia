# Shadowhaven Undercity

## General Info
**Location**: [[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/Locations/Shadowhaven]]

## Description
The Shadowhaven Undercity is a sprawling network of tunnels and caverns that lies beneath the city of Shadowhaven. It is a dangerous and lawless place, and it is home to all manner of strange and dangerous creatures.

## GM Notes
- The Undercity is a good place to find illegal goods and services, but it is also a very dangerous place.
- The Thieves Guild and the Shadowhaven Smugglers Ring both have a strong presence in the Undercity.
- There are many ancient ruins and hidden treasures to be found in the Undercity, but they are all well-guarded.
