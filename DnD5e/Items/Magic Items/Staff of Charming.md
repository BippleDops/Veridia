## Description
While holding this [[Staff|staff]], you can use an action to expend 1 of its 10 charges to cast **[[Charm Person|charm person]]**, **[[Command|command]],** or **[[Comprehend Languages (Ritual)|Comprehend Languages]]** from it using your spell save [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]]. The staff can also be used as a magic [[Quarterstaff|quarterstaff]].

If you are holding the [[Staff|staff]] and fail a saving throw against an [[Enchantment|enchantment]] spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can’t use this property of the staff again until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment spell that targets only you, with or without the staff’s intervention, you can use your [[12 - The Order of Combat|reaction]] to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.

The [[Staff|staff]] regains `dice: 1d8+2` (1d8+2) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical [[Quarterstaff|quarterstaff]].
