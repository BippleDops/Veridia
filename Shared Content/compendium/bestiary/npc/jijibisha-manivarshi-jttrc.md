## Description

Jijibisha Manivarshi, a vicious soul from the land's past, lurks in the nearby forest. Long ago she made a deal with wicked otherworldly forces that gave her longevity and fiendish powers, a bargain that ultimately resulted in the ruin of Manivarsha.

Despite her fiendish powers, she looks like an ancient, withered human.
