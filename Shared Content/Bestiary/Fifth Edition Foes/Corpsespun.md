## Special Traits
**Spider-Infested:** Spiders continually crawl out of corpsespun, swarm over them, and fall to the ground around the undead's feet. All creatures other than a corpsepinner or other corpsespun that are adjacent to a corpsespun at the end of the corpsespun's turn take 2 (`dice: 1d4`) poison damage from spider bites. This damage is cumulative from multiple adjacent corpsespun.

## Actions
**Claw:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d6+2`) slashing damage plus 2 (`dice: 1d4`) poison damage and the target is poisoned. A poisoned creature can make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns; a successful save ends the condition.

**Spider Spray (Recharge 5—6):** *Ranged Attack:* automatic hit, range 20 ft. cone, all creatures in cone. Hit: target must make a successful DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (`dice: 1d6`) piercing damage plus 7 (`dice: 2d6`) poison damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Astral Plane

**Organization**: Troupe (4–9 plus 1 [[Corpsespinner|corpsespinner]])

## Description
Corpsespun resemble zombies that are infested with spiders. Spiders crawl in and out of their bodies through their mouths, ears, nostrils, eye sockets, and wounds, and the creatures can vomit out a stream of spiders as an attack. They tend to be draped in webbing. Corpsepun follow the commands of the [[Corpsespinner|corpsespinner]] that created them, which they receive telepathically. If a [[Corpsespinner|corpsespinner]] is killed, its corpsespun minions continue carrying out their last instructions, and they fight to protect their master’s body or its home web; otherwise, they have little purpose and are not innately hostile without a [[Corpsespinner|corpsespinner]] telling them who to kill.
