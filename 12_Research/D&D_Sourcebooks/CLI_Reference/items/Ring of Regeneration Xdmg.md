# Ring of Regeneration
*Ring, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/ring-of-regeneration.webp#right)

While wearing this ring, you regain `d6` [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] every 10 minutes if you have at least 1 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]]. If you lose a body part, the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full functionality after `1d6 + 1` days if you have at least 1 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] the whole time.
