# The Sunken Conspiracy
*An Aquabyssos Adventure for Characters of Levels 1-3*

## Adventure Overview

**Duration**: 5 sessions (approximately 20-25 hours of play)  
**Party Level**: 1st-3rd level  
**Party Size**: 3-6 characters  
**Adventure Type**: Investigation, Conspiracy, Action-Adventure

### Synopsis

The busy port of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]] has become plagued by mysterious ship disappearances. What begins as a simple investigation into missing merchant vessels soon unravels a complex conspiracy involving smugglers, corrupt officials, and ancient technology that threatens the stability of both Aquabyssos and the surface world. The party must navigate treacherous political waters, pursue enemies through pressure tube systems, infiltrate a hidden smuggling base, and ultimately confront a conspiracy that reaches to the highest levels of government.

### Central Mystery

Ships carrying sensitive cargo have been vanishing from Port Meridian's harbor. The disappearances follow a specific pattern - they happen during new moon nights, always involve vessels with valuable or sensitive cargo, and leave no trace. The truth is more complex: a conspiracy exists between corrupt harbor officials, ambitious smugglers, and agents of [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Shadow Conspiracy]] to steal artifacts and resources that could destabilize the delicate balance between the underwater kingdom and surface world.
