# Bear Trap
## Overview
*Simple trap (level 1â€“4, dangerous threat)*
A bear trap resembles a set of iron jaws that springs shut when stepped on, clamping down on a creature's leg. The trap is spiked in the ground, leaving the victim immobilized.
#### Trigger.
A creature that steps on the bear trap triggers it.
#### Effect.
*Melee Weapon Attack*: +8 to hit, triggering creature. Hit: 5 (1d10) piercing damage. This attack can't gain advantage or disadvantage. A creature hit by the trap has its speed reduced to 0. It can't move until it breaks free of the trap, which requires a successful DC 15 Strength check by the creature or another creature adjacent to the trap.
#### Countermeasures.
A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the trap. A successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disables it.
