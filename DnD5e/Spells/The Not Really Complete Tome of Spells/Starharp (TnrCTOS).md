# Starharp (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (10-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (one of your tears and a tiny harp, carved out of wood, bone, or ivory)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You softly hum or sing a song and a blue-white, glowing image of a harp, surrounded by little stars of twinkling radiance, that floats in mid-air just above you.

All creatures within 10 feet of you are freed from one effect of being charmed, frightened, incapacitated, or stunned, or it will restore one level of exhaustion. In addi-tion, each round, if you choose to, you may concentrate on a creature within range, and that creature regains 30 hit points. You may continue to concentrate on that individual for multiple rounds, or you may pick a dif-ferent target.
