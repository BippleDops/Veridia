*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 158. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* Gricks tend to be solitary hunters, but young gricks might lurk near dozens of their brood mates for years before gradually drifting apart. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Gricks *Worms That Hunt the Dark and Decaying* - **Habitat.** Forest, Underdark - **Treasure.** Any Gricks are wormlike predators that burst from hidingâ€”flailing and snappingâ€”to consume whatever prey passes near. They hide in cavernous crags or amid deadfalls, the scattered bones and possessions of past meals the only evidence of their threat. Gricks' origins are unclear, but some suggest these creatures arise from natural worms or similar invertebrates mutated by magical phenomena. Many cite the presence of gricks in a region as evidence of portals to other planes of existence, legendary magic items, or powerful supernatural beings.```statblock

Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
