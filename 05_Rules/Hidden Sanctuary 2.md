## Historical Development

### The Great Retreat

The Hidden Sanctuary was established during the early days of [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Crystal Influence's spread across [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]], when organized surface resistance became impossible due to the corruption's rapid advancement. As major cities fell to crystal influence and government structures were infiltrated or destroyed, surviving free-willed citizens were forced to seek refuge in locations beyond the reach of crystalline contamination.

The sanctuary's founders, led by former royal guards and military officers who had escaped the palace's fall, discovered the cave system during a desperate search for safe haven. Initial exploration revealed that the deep stone formations naturally blocked crystal influence, creating dead zones where the corruption could not spread. This discovery led to the decision to establish a permanent resistance base within the cave network.

Early development focused on basic survival needs - establishing clean water sources, securing food supplies, and creating defensible positions against potential crystal-influenced attackers. As more survivors found their way to the sanctuary, the focus shifted toward building infrastructure for long-term habitation and developing capabilities for active resistance operations.

The transformation from refugee camp to resistance stronghold occurred gradually as survivors organized themselves into functional units, established leadership structures, and began planning systematic efforts to combat the crystal influence. The sanctuary evolved from a place of hiding into a base for active opposition to the corruption.

### Expansion and Organization

As the sanctuary's population grew and its mission expanded beyond simple survival, extensive construction projects were undertaken to transform the natural cave system into a functional underground city.
