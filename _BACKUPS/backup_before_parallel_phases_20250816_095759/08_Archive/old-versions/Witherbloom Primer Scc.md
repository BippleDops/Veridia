*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)* The Witherbloom Primer is a magic textbook created at Strixhaven's Witherbloom College. The primer has 3 charges, and it regains`d3`expended charges daily at dawn. If you make an Intelligence ([[skills#Nature|Nature) or Wisdom ([skills#Survival|Survival]]) check while holding the primer, you can expend 1 charge to give yourself a`d4`bonus to the check, immediately after you roll the`d20`. In addition, if you study the primer at the end of a long rest, you can choose one 1st-level spell from the druid or wizard spell list. Before you finish your next long rest, you can cast the chosen spell once without a spell slot if you are holding the primer. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. *Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 39* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Witherbloom primer scc is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
