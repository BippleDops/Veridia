--- # Leomund's Tiny Hut

*3rd-level, Evocation (ritual)* - **Casting time:** 1 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Self (10-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a crystal bead)
- **Duration:** 8 hours A 10-foot [[Area of Effect Xphb springs into existence around you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell fails when you cast it if the [Area of Effect Xphb]] isn't big enough to fully encapsulate all creatures in its area. Creatures and objects within the [[Area of Effect Xphb when you cast the spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells of level 3 or lower can't be cast through it, and the effects of such spells can't extend into it. The atmosphere inside the [Area of Effect Xphb]] is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside. Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to have [[Light Xphb or [darkness-xphb (variant-rules)]] (no action required). The [[Area of Effect Xphb is opaque from the outside and of any color you choose, but it's transparent from the inside. The spell ends early if you leave the [Area of Effect Xphb]] or if you cast it again. **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 291.
