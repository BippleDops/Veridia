# Familiar, Blight Cockerel
## Overview
### Blight Cockerel
![[umlyyteg.3ih.png|Blight Cockerel|300]]
[[umlyyteg.3ih.png|open outside]]

*Lanky and bedraggled, with thin feathers other than a wide tuft around the neck, this rooster is particularly ugly for its kind. Its wattle and comb are both shredded and torn from past battles, and razor-sharp spurs have been tied to the backs of its legs.*

## Special Traits
**Ferocity:** When the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] cockerel drops to 0 hit points, it immediately makes one attack against a creature within 5 feet as a reaction before dying.

**Fighting Fury:** When a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] cockerel sees another member of its species or other similar-sized bird (other than a chicken), it instinctively triggers its fight response. It spends 1 round attempting to intimidate its opponent, then attacks, gaining a +1 bonus to attacks and damage. A [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] cockerel in a fighting fury fights until it or its opponent is dead.

## Actions
**Melee Attack—Beak:** +3 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: 1 piercing damage.

## Description
**Environment**: Any land (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary

Cockfighting is a common pastime among the coarser citizens of the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] (and secretly many of the upper crust as well) and the gamecocks have been bred for centuries in the city just for these contests. The resulting breed of [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] cockerel is a distempered gamecock known for its viciousness in fights and its instinct to continue fighting even after having taken a mortal wound. Many runners of cockfights no longer allow [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] cockerels in their venues because of the likelihood that neither bird will survive and their investment in training a prized gamecock will be lost even in victory. [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] cockerels are bred with normal chickens and always attack another [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] cockerel on sight unless restrained.

Before fighting matches that involve betting, some [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] cockerels are outfitted with fighting spurs: razor-sharp blades tied to their legs. Fighting spurs replace the bird’s beak attack with a spur attack, which has the same attack bonus and reach but does `dice: 1d4` slashing damage.

A [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] cockerel stands 2 feet tall and weighs 10–15 pounds.
