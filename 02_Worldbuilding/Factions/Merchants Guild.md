# Merchants Guild

## General Info
**Location**: [[01_Campaigns/Campaign_Name/Locations/Shadowhaven.md]]

## Description
The Merchants Guild is a powerful and influential guild that controls all of the legitimate trade in and out of Shadowhaven. They are a force to be reckoned with, and they are not afraid to use their wealth and influence to protect their interests.

## GM Notes
- The guild is led by a council of wealthy merchants, including [[01_Campaigns/Campaign_Name/NPCs/Lady Seraphina Goldleaf.md]].
- The guild is a rival of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Factions/Thieves Guild.md]] and the [[02_Worldbuilding/Factions/The Crimson Fleet.md]].
- The guild is a potential patron for the party, but they will expect a hefty price for their services.
