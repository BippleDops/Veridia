**Type**: Rule Variant / Subsystem / Optional Rule
**Complexity**: Moderate
**Purpose**: Enhance gameplay in specific situations ## Description

**Details**: Rich sensory elements bring this to life. System2 provides a structured approach to handling specific game situations that benefit from additional mechanical depth. This system integrates with existing D&D 5e rules while adding meaningful choices and consequences. ### Basic Resolution

The fundamental process works as follows: 1. **Trigger**: Specific situation arises requiring this mechanic
2. Meanwhile, **Setup**: Establish parameters and stakes
3. **Action**: Players make choices using the system
4. **Resolution**: Determine outcomes based on rolls and decisions
5. **Consequences**: Apply results to ongoing game ### Prerequisites


Before using this mechanic:
- Specific conditions must be met
- Players must have certain capabilities
- DM establishes parameters #### Step 1: Initiation

Determine when and how the mechanic activates:
- Player-triggered vs. DM-triggered
- Required declarations or preparations
- Cost or risk assessment #### Step 2: Execution

The actual mechanical process:
1. Declare intended outcome
2. Commit resources (if applicable)
3. Make necessary rolls
4. Apply modifiers and advantages
5. Compare to target numbers #### Step 3: Results


Determining success and degree:
- **Critical Success** (20 or beat DC by 10+): Exceptional outcome
- **Success** (Meet or beat DC): Intended result achieved
- **Partial Success** (Fail by 5 or less): Limited success with complication
- **Failure** (Fail by 6+): Intended result not achieved
- **Critical Failure** (1 or fail by 10+): Significant negative consequence ### Example 1: Basic Use

*Scenario*: [Specific situation]
- Player declares intent
- DM sets DC 15
- Player rolls d20+5, gets 17
- Success achieved with described outcome ### Example 2: Complex Application

*Scenario*: [More complex situation]
- Multiple participants involved
- Extended challenge requiring multiple rolls
- Resource management element
- Partial successes building to completion ### Example 3: Failed Attempt

*Scenario*: [Failure situation]
- What went wrong
- Consequences of failure
- Recovery options
- Learning from failure ### With Combat

How this mechanic works during combat:
- Action/bonus action/reaction cost
- Interaction with initiative
- Effects on combat dynamics ### With Exploration

Application during exploration:
- Time requirements
- Resource consumption
- Discovery opportunities
- Environmental interactions ### With Social Encounters

Using in social situations:
- Influence on negotiations
- Reputation effects
- Information gathering
- Relationship building ### Simplified Version

For quicker resolution:
- Single roll instead of multiple
- Fixed DCs instead of scaling
- Binary success/failure ### Advanced Version

For more detail:
- Additional roll types
- Multiple resource tracks
- Expanded outcome table
- Long-term consequences ### Alternative Approaches

Different ways to handle:
- Skill challenge format
- Narrative-focused resolution
- Point-buy system
- Card or dice pool mechanic ### Setting-Specific

Adapt for different settings:
- Fantasy adjustments
- Modern applications
- Science fiction variants
- Horror modifications ### Table Preferences

Adjust for group style:
- More/less rolling
- Narrative focus
- Tactical emphasis
- Player comfort level ### Problem 1: Overuse

Solution: Implement cooldowns or costs ### Problem 2: Complexity

Solution: Use simplified version initially ### Problem 3: Balance

Solution: Adjust DCs and modifiers ## Designer Notes This mechanic aims to:

- Add depth without overwhelming complexity
- Provide meaningful choices
- Create memorable moments
- Enhance rather than replace core rules ## Quick Reference **When to Use**: [Specific triggers]

**Basic Roll**: d20 + modifier vs. DC
**Success**: Achieve intended outcome
**Failure**: Complication or seck
**Resources**: [If applicable]
**Recovery**: [How resources return] ---
