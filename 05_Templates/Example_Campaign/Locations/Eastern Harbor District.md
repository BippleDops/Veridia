# Eastern Harbor District

## General Info
**Location**: [[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/Locations/Shadowhaven]]

## Description
The Eastern Harbor District is a rough and tumble district that is home to the city's docks, warehouses, and taverns. It is a place of hard work and hard drinking, and it is not a place for the faint of heart.

## GM Notes
- The district is a hotbed of criminal activity, and it is a good place to find illegal goods and services.
- The city guard keeps a close eye on the district, but they are reluctant to intervene unless absolutely necessary.
- The Thieves Guild and the Shadowhaven Smugglers Ring both have a strong presence in the district.
