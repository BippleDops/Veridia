## Description
We now manufacture togas as part of our premiere line of outerwear, straight out of the empires of Mulhorand, Unther, and Chessenta. You can purchase these in either wool (8 cp), or linen (3 sp). We can also offer to you, at a nominal charge, custom-made togas that contain concealed pockets in which to hide a dagger or stiletto. These togas are becoming extremely popular in the Heartlands.
