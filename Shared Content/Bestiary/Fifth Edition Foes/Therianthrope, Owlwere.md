## Description
Owlweres appear as normal humanoids in human form. They tend to have large eyes, and they are shy and quiet. In settled areas, they can be found working as aides to scholars or as crafters in trades where their high dexterity and amazing eyesight are assets, such as jewelry-making and clockwork. But most owlweres prefer solitude over any sort of town life. The sometimes rent their services as independent mercenaries specializing in scouting out enemy forces, a function at which they excel.
