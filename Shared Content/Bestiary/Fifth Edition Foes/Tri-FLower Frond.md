## Special Traits
**Camouflage:** A tri-flower frond looks like a normal, if exotic, flowering plant. Until it attacks, its dangerous nature can be recognized only with close inspection and a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check. Once characters have fought these plants, they can be recognized again on sight.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A tri-flower frond makes two melee attacks.

**Tranquilizing Tendrils:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (`dice: 1d4+2`) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become unconscious. This is a poison effect; resistance or immunity to sleep effects dont apply against it. The creature remains unconscious for one hour or until wakened with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.

**Digestive Juice:** *Melee Attack:* automatic hit, reach 5 ft., one unconscious creature. Hit: 3 (`dice: 1d6`) acid damage.

**Fluid Drain:*** Melee Attack*: automatic hit, reach 5 ft., one unconscious creature. Hit: the target is grappled and its Constitution score is reduced by `dice: 1d3` points. A creature dies if its Constitution is reduced to 0.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Warm forests and hills

**Organization**: Solitary, patch (2–5), or grove (6–11)

## Description
Tri-flower fronds are carnivorous plants found in warm forests and hilly regions. Rarely, they extend their range into mild temperate zones. They are immobile, but they reproduce readily by releasing seeds into the air. The seeds drift on the wind or hitch rides on passing creatures. They take root rapidly once they touch the ground, and reach full maturity within a few months.

These creatures are active round the clock. They dine on fresh meat of any kind, having no preference for one kind over any other. When a potential meal falls victim to the tri-flower’s narcotic poison, the plant droops a frond over the fallen creature, allowing its yellow bloom to drip a shower of highly caustic digestive enzymes onto the sleeping victim. It then inserts a needlelike tendril from its red bloom deep into the victim’s body and drains its fluids and dissolving organs. A tri-flower frond stands 5 to 8 feet tall. A combination of orange, red, and yellow flowers is most common, but varieties with other color combinations exist, including white, gray, and pearly silver-gray, and golden brown, deep brown and russet.

Tri-flower fronds are popular in the gardens of wizards and alchemists, because their narcotic poison and digestive juices are useful in many concoctions. They are also planted defensively around the homes of many magic-users, wealthy merchants, and potentates in areas where they’ll flourish, because they never sleep and thieves or assassins trying to creep silently past them make perfect targets for their tranquilizing tendrils.
