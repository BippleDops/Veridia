- Location of pre-Parliament civilization ruins
- Extreme environment requiring specialized equipment
- Theoretical maximum depth for current pressure technology **Dr. [Nerida Saltweave]]'s Briefing** (Parliament's [[Chief Analyst): > "These coordinates correspond to the [Hadean Trench]], a location we've long considered uninhabitable even by our standards. According to archaeological surveys, it was the site of the [[First Throne—the original seat of power that predated our current Parliament by centuries. The facility shown in [Agent Tempest]]'s data appears to be built into or around these ancient ruins." **What the [[Ancients Left Behind**:

- **Combat**: If threatened, defends itself with electrical attacks **Information from the Collective** (if successfully communicated with): > *Images flood your mind: ancient cities with impossible architecture, beings of light and shadow manipulating pressure itself, and warnings about "those who seek to bind the deep currents to surface chains."* **Encounter 2: [[The Memory Eaters** (14,000 feet) > Strange, semi-transparent creatures shaped like flattened rays swim near the submarine. Where they touch the hull, the metal seems to become confused about its own nature—shifting between states of matter in impossible ways. Dr. Wellspring shouts a warning: "Those are [Memory Eaters]]! They consume the history of objects, making them forget what they're supposed to be!" **[[Memory Eaters** (use Ooze stats with special abilities):
- **[Memory Drain]]**: Touch attacks cause objects to lose structural integrity
- **[[Forgetfulness Aura**: Creatures within 30 feet must save or forget recent events
- **[Phase Shift]]**: Can partially exist in multiple states of matter
- **[[Ancient Knowledge**: Contain fragments of memories from the [First Throne]] **[[Combat Considerations**:
- **[Structural Damage]]**: Can weaken the submarine's hull
- **[[Mental Effects**: Party members may lose memories temporarily
- **[Tactical Options]]**: Use bright lights to drive them away
- **[[Information Gathering**: Defeating them may reveal memory fragments ### Discovery of the [Ancient Facility]] **[[The First Sight** (15,000 feet): > As the *Pressure's End* crests a thermal vent ridge, the lights reveal something that defies explanation. Carved directly into the walls of the [Hadean Trench]] is a city—but not like any in Aquabyssos today. The architecture flows like frozen water, with spires that spiral through dimensions that seem to fold in on themselves. Ancient bioluminescent systems still pulse with life after centuries, and throughout the complex, you can see the harsh geometric additions of surface world technology grafted onto the organic forms like scars on living flesh. **[[The Facility Complex**:
- **[Ancient Core]]**: The original [[First Throne architecture
- **[Modern Additions]]**: Surface world technology and conspiracy modifications
- **[[Active Sections**: Areas with power and life support

- **[[Emergency Extraction**: Pre-planned escape routes and signals #### [The Memory]] Palace **[[First Encounter with [Ancient Technology]]**: > Entering through the flooded archaeological passages, you find yourself in a vast spherical chamber that defies the laws of physics. The walls are covered in what appear to be enormous pearls, each one glowing with soft bioluminescence. As you approach, you realize these aren't pearls—they're memory orbs, each one containing the experiences and knowledge of the ancient civilization that built this place. **[[The Memory Orbs**: Contain fragments of historical information. **[Sample Memory]] Contents** (Investigation **DC 15** to access safely):
1. **[[The Great Submersion**: How the [First Civilization]] chose to sink beneath the waves
2. **[[The Pressure Wars**: Ancient conflicts over who controlled the depths
3. **[The Surface]] Betrayal**: Why the ancients distrusted the surface world
4. **[[The Deep Current**: Understanding of the planet's true hydrodynamic systems
5. **[The Warning]]**: Prophecies about future surface world interference **[[Ancient Guardian Encounter**: > As you examine the memory orbs, the water around you begins to shimmer, and a figure emerges—not quite solid, not quite spirit. It appears to be one of the ancient rulers, maintained as a consciousness within the facility's systems. Its voice carries the weight of centuries: "Who disturbs the memories of the deep? accomplish you come seeking knowledge, or accomplish you serve those who would bind the currents to surface chains?" **[The First]] [[Throne Guardian** (use Ghost stats with modifications):
- **Appearance**: Regal figure from the ancient civilization
- **Personality**: Wise but suspicious, protective of ancient knowledge
- **Abilities**: Control over facility systems, memory manipulation
- **Goals**: Test party's intentions, protect ancient secrets **Interaction with the Guardian**:
- **Reverence**: Show respect for ancient civilization (**DC 15** Persuasion)

- **Purpose**: Explain mission to stop surface world conspiracy (**DC 16** Insight)
- **Combat**: If negotiations fail, Guardian will defend facility **Information from the Guardian** (if befriended): > "The surface dwellers have awakened technologies that should sleep. They promise your people power in exchange for servitude, but they cannot understand the price of controlling the deep currents. The facility you see corrupted was once a place of harmony—now it serves as a laboratory for horrors that combine our ancient knowledge with their mechanical coldness." #### [The Living]] Archives **[[Biological Data Storage**: > This chamber contains something between a library and a garden. Living coral formations store information in their growth patterns, while bioluminescent fungi display data across their surfaces. Schools of specially bred fish swim in complex patterns, their movements encoding historical records. It's beautiful, alien, and absolutely fascinating—but you can see where surface world technicians have been cutting into the living systems, trying to extract data with crude mechanical methods. **[Sabotage Discovery]]** (Investigation **DC 16**):
- Surface world extraction has damaged 40% of the archive
- Some extracted data copieded to mechanical storage
- Critical historical records about deep-sea treaty agreements have been stolen
- Ancient warnings about pressure manipulation ignoreded **[[Restoration Opportunity**: If party has magical healing or Dr. Wellspring's expertise:
- **Medicine **DC 18****: Stabilize damaged biological systems
- **Nature **DC 16****: Understand how to encourage natural healing
- **Arcana **DC 20****: Interface ancient magic with modern healing **Success**: Archive begins regenerating, reveals additional information about ancient treaties with surface civilizations. #### [Processing Centers]] - [[The Horror Revealed **[The Medical]] Bay of Nightmares**: > Through reinforced viewing ports, you see the true scope of the conspiracy's atrocities. In sterile chambers that combine ancient organic architecture with harsh surface world medical equipment, dozens of examination tables hold the missing crews. Some are conscious but blank-eyed, others are in various stages of physical and mental modification. Surface world technicians in environmental suits work alongside controlled Aquabyssos citizens, performing procedures that violate every principle of medical ethics. **[[Key Observations**:
- **25 [Captured Individuals]]**: Various stages of modification
- **5 [[Surface World Technicians**: Advanced medical equipment and training
- **3 [Modified Guards]]**: [[Former Aquabyssos citizens now serving as security
- **[Experimental Subjects]]**: Some modifications appear to be experimental
- **Documentation**: Detailed records of procedures and their success rates **[[The Modification Process** (Medicine **DC 17** to understand): 1. **[Memory Extraction]]**: Original personality removed and stored
2. **[[Neural Implantation**: Control devices installed in brain tissue
3. **[Physical Enhancement]]**: Strength, endurance, and capability improvements
4. **Programming**: New loyalty and skill sets implanted
5. **[[Final Integration**: Subject awakens with new identity serving conspiracy **[Rescue Opportunities]] and Dilemmas**: **[[Immediate Rescues** (Stealth vs. [Alert Trade]]-off): - **[[Stealth Approach**: Save some people without alerting guards
- **[Direct Action]]**: Save everyone but trigger facility-wide alarm
- **Sabotage**: Disrupt equipment to prevent further modifications
- **Intelligence**: Document everything for legal/diplomatic evidence **[[Medical Assessment** (Dr. Wellspring's Analysis): > "Some of these modifications can be reversed, but it will take time and resources we don't have here. The neural implants can be removed surgically, but the memory reconstruction... That's going to require facilities back in [Port Meridian]], if it's possible at all. The longer we wait, the more permanent the changes become." #### [[Technology Labs - [Surface World]] Secrets **[[Advanced Research Facility**: > This section of the facility is alien to Aquabyssos eyes. Clean geometric surfaces, artificial lighting, and technology that seems to bend reality around itself. Here, surface world scientists work to merge their mechanical expertise with ancient Aquabyssos biological systems. The results are both impressive and disturbing—weapons that channel pressure itself, vehicles that exist in multiple dimensions, and communication systems that span impossible distances. **[Research Projects]] Discovered**:
1. **[[Pressure Weaponization**: Using ancient knowledge to create devastating weapons
2. **[Dimensional Manipulation]]**: Technology that affects space itself
3. **[[Biological Control**: Improved methods for controlling modified subjects
4. **[Resource Extraction]]**: Techniques for harvesting ancient power sources
5. **[[Invasion Preparation**: Equipment specifically designed for surface-to-underwater warfare **[Key Personnel]]**: - **[[Chief Researcher Dr. [Helena Voidwright]]** (use Mage stats): - Surface world scientist leading the research - Genuinely believes she's helping both civilizations - Has extensive knowledge of ancient and modern technology - Could be convinced to switch sides with proper evidence **[[Intelligence Gathering** (Investigation **DC 18**):
- **[Invasion Timeline]]**: Surface fleet arrives in 48 hours
- **[[Technology Transfer**: Ancient weapons being sent to surface
- **[Communication Logs]]**: Evidence of surface world's real intentions
- **[[Facility Defenses**: Complete layout of security systems #### [Command Center]] - [[The Conspiracy's Heart **[The Operational]] Hub**: > At the center of the modern additions sits the conspiracy's command center—a blend of ancient architecture and cutting-edge technology. Multiple viewing screens show real-time images of surface world naval operations, Parliament proceedings, and various sites throughout Aquabyssos. Here, the full scope of the conspiracy's reach becomes apparent: this isn't just about stolen ships or political manipulation. This is preparation for total war between worlds. **[[Present Leadership**:
- **[Commodore Marcus]] Shadowfin** (if not captured in Session 3)
- **[[Surface Admiral [Cortez Ironwave]]** (visiting for final planning)
- **[[Modified Command Staff**: 4 individuals who were once Parliament officials **[Current Operations]] Briefing** (if party can overhear): > [[Admiral Ironwave's voice carries cold authority: "The demonstration at Parliament was adequate, but insufficient. [Phase Four]] requires complete submission or complete destruction. The ancient weapons are now in our possession, Commodore. Your people will either serve the new order or be replaced by those who will." **[[Critical Intelligence Available**:
- **[Surface Fleet]] Composition**: 12 warships with ancient-technology weapons
- **[[Invasion Plan**: Simultaneous strikes on 5 major Aquabyssos cities
- **Ultimatum**: Surrender or face genocide using ancient pressure weapons
- **[Collaboration Terms]]**: Aquabyssos leadership would be replaced with modified subjects
- **Timeline**: Invasion begins at surface world dawn (30 hours) ### [[The Rescue Operation **[Moral Complexity]] of the Modified**: **Encounter with [[Modified Parliament Official**: > Among the modified subjects, you recognize [Senator Maria]] Tidecaller, a reform politician known for her advocacy of surface world cooperation. She looks up as you enter, and for a moment, her eyes show recognition and desperate hope. Then the implants activate, and she speaks in a flat, emotionless voice: "Intruders detected. Security protocol activated." But tears run down her face as she reaches for an alarm. **[[The Dilemma**:
- **[Restrain Her]]**: Prevent alarm but must harm someone fighting against their will
- **[[Try Communication**: Attempt to reach her original personality (very difficult)
- **[Medical Intervention]]**: Dr. Wellspring might disable implants (risky, time-consuming)
- **[[Accept Alarm**: Allow her to alert facility but avoid harming a victim **[Batch Rescue]] Decisions**: Multiple groups require different approaches:
- **[[Recently Modified**: High chance of recovery, easier to transport
- **Long-term Modified**: More capable in combat but harder to recover
- **[Experimental Subjects]]**: May have unique information but unstable conditions
- **[[Child Subjects**: Moral imperative but extremely vulnerable #### [The Pressure]] Throne **[[The Heart of [Ancient Power]]**: > In the deepest chamber of the facility, you find the [[Pressure Throne—a crystalline seat that seems to exist in all dimensions simultaneously. Ancient inscriptions warn that it controls the fundamental forces that keep the ocean floor stable, and surface world equipment grafteded around it like a parasite feeding on a host. The combination is unstable, dangerous, and could potentially devastate the entire region if misused. **[The Immediate]] Threat**: Surface world technicians are attempting to extract the throne's power source for their weapons. **[[Technical Analysis** (Arcana **DC 20** + [Engineer Brass]]'s expertise):
- **[[Current Status**: 67% of the power extraction is complete
- **[Completion Timeline]]**: 4 hours until total extraction
- **Consequences of Completion**: Ancient pressure systems fail, causing massive tectonic shifts
- **[[Sabotage Options**: Multiple ways to disrupt extraction, varying risks **[Sabotage Options]]**: 1. **[[Careful Disruption**: Remove surface world equipment without damaging ancient systems
2. **[Controlled Overload]]**: Force feedback that disables extraction but damages facility
3. **[[Total Destruction**: Destroy everything to prevent surface world access (massive casualties)
4. **Redirection**: Turn the power source against the surface world invasion fleet #### Confrontation with [Admiral Cortez]] Ironwave **[[The Meeting** (if party infiltrates command center): > [Admiral Cortez]] Ironwave is exactly what you'd expect from a surface world military leader: rigid, efficient, and utterly convinced of his own righteousness. When he notices your presence, he doesn't seem surprised. "Ah, the Parliament's investigators. I was wondering when you'd track us down. I suppose you think you're here to stop some grand conspiracy?" **[[Admiral Ironwave** (use Knight stats enhanced with surface technology):
- **Personality**: Coldly rational, believes ends justify means
- **Equipment**: Advanced surface world armor and weapons
- **Goals**: [Secure Aquabyssos]] as surface world protectorate
- **Methods**: Will negotiate if it serves surface interests **[[The Admiral's Offer**: > "Look around you. Your people's ancient technology, combined with surface engineering, could solve both our civilizations' problems. The surface needs underwater resources and territory. Aquabyssos needs protection from the chaos of surface politics. We're offering peaceful integration under surface leadership. The alternative is invasion and occupation." **[Negotiation Possibilities]]**:
- **Terms**: Aquabyssos becomes surface world territory with local autonomy
- **Leadership**: [[Modified Parliament under surface oversight
- **Resources**: Ancient technology shared with surface world
- **Population**: Citizens can choose modification or relocation **Party's [Response Options]]**:
- **[[Outright Rejection**: Refuse all cooperation, prepare for war
- **Negotiation**: Try to find middle ground (very difficult given surface position)
- **Deception**: Pretend to agree while planning sabotage
- **[Evidence Gathering]]**: Document offer for diplomatic purposes
- **Combat**: Direct confrontation with surface leadership ### [[The Ancient Guardian's Proposal **[The First]] [[Throne Guardian's [Final Offer]]**: > The ancient consciousness appears one final time as you face the critical decisions: "Children of the depths, the choice before you will echo through the centuries. I can awaken the full power of this place—enough to repel any surface invasion and protect Aquabyssos forever. But the cost is isolation. Your people would be powerful but alone, cut off from the surface world permanently. Or you may choose the harder path—find a way for both civilizations to coexist without domination." **[[The Ancient Option**: Complete activation of [First Throne]] technology
- **Advantages**: Total protection from surface world, access to incredible ancient knowledge
- **Disadvantages**: Aquabyssos becomes isolated, no surface interaction possible
- **Requirements**: Sacrifice current Parliament structure, adopt ancient goverce
- **Timeline**: Can be activated immediately to repel invasion ### Multi-[[Front Battle **The facility becomes a war zone as various plans execute simultaneously**: #### [Combat Front]]: [[Facility Security **If the party is discovered or chooses direct action**: **[Enemy Forces]]**: - **[[Facility Security**: 8 [Modified Guards]] (use Bandit stats with loyalty programming)
- **[[Surface Marines**: 6 Professional soldiers (use Guard stats with advanced equipment)
- **[Defense Systems]]**: Ancient constructs reprogrammed for facility defense
- **[[Experimental Creatures**: Modified sea creatures used as living weapons **[Environmental Factors]]**:
- **[[Ancient Architecture**: Provides cover but some areas are unstable
- **[Pressure Fluctuations]]**: Ancient systems cause varying environmental effects
- **[[Flooding Hazards**: Battle damage could flood sections of facility
- **[Technology Overloads]]**: Damaged equipment creates electrical hazards #### [[Rescue Front: Saving the Modified **Simultaneous rescue operations** while combat rages: **Challenges**: - **[Medical Complexity]]**: Removing implants safely takes time
- **Transportation**: Moving unconscious/unstable patients during battle
- **[[Priority Decisions**: Who to save first when resources are limited
- **[Emotional Impact]]**: Dealing with people who don't want to be saved **Dr. Wellspring's [[Mobile Surgery** (if protected by party):
- Can attempt to remove implants in field conditions
- Each attempt takes 10 minutes and requires medical check **DC 16**
- Failure risks patient's life but may still remove control programming
- Success rate improves if party provides security and assistance #### [Sabotage Front]]: [[The Pressure Throne **[Technical Challenge]]** to sabotage power extraction: **Phase 1: Accessing the Controls** - **Security**: Ancient lockouts require historical knowledge (**DC 18** History)
- **Technology**: Surface systems need technical expertise (**DC 16** Investigation)
- **Timing**: Must coordinate with other operations to maximize effect **Phase 2: [[Sabotage Execution**
- **[Careful Method]]**: Remove surface tech without damaging ancient systems (**DC 20** Thieves' Tools)
- **[[Fast Method**: Overload extraction systems (**DC 15** Arcana, causes facility damage)
- **[Dramatic Method]]**: Redirect power as weapon (**DC 18** Engineering, affects invasion fleet) #### [[Commodore Shadowfin's [Last Stand]] **[[If Shadowfin wasn't resolved in Session 3**: > [Commodore Marcus]] Shadowfin stands before the [[Pressure Throne, his form now more machine than man after extensive modifications. "You still don't understand," he growls through a voice box that shouldn't fit in his throat. "This isn't about power or politics anymore. It's about survival. The surface world will never let us exist as equals. At least this way, some of our people will survive as servants rather than dying as rebels." **[Modified Commodore]] Shadowfin** (use Veteran stats with enhancements): - **[[Physical Modifications**: Partially mechanical, enhanced strength and durability
- **[Mental State]]**: Original personality degraded, fixated on "saving" Aquabyssos
- **Equipment**: Combination of ancient and surface world technology
- **Tactics**: Uses knowledge of facility systems and ancient power **[[Possible Resolutions**:
- **Combat**: Straight fight with enhanced enemy
- **Redemption**: Convince him he's been manipulated (extremely difficult)
- **Sacrifice**: He chooses to destroy facility rather than let surface world win
- **Capture**: Take him alive for potential future rehabilitation #### [Admiral Ironwave]]'s Ultimatum **[[The Surface World's [Final Offer]]**: > Even as battle rages, [[Admiral Ironwave maintains his position: "This facility is just one installation. Destroy it, and we'll build others. Kill me, and the invasion proceeds on schedule. But prove that Aquabyssos can be reasonable partners, and we can still find a peaceful solution." **[The Admiral]]'s Leverage**:
- **[[Invasion Fleet**: Will attack regardless of facility status
- **[Ancient Weapons]]**: Some already transferred to surface world
- **[[Modified Agents**: Placed throughout Aquabyssos government
- **Hostages**: Surface world holds captured Aquabyssos citizens **[Resolution Paths]]**:

The power to control the deep currents is not a gift to be used lightly. We learned, too late, that such power corrupts both user and system. The surface dwellers arrived at us in our time, as they come to you in yours, promising cooperation but seeking domination. They cannot understand that the deep currents are alive, that pressure is not merely force but consciousness. Their mechanical minds see only resources to exploit. We chose isolation over subjugation, diving deeper than they could follow. But isolation is its own prison. Learn from our choice—find the third path between submission and separation. [The Throne]] responds to will and wisdom combined. Use it to protect, never to conquer. The deep currents remember all debts, and they always collect. [REMAINDER DAMAGED BY WATER DAMAGE] ### Handout 11: [[Surface World [Intelligence Report]] CLASSIFIED - OPERATION DEEP SUBMISSION [[Intelligence Summary for [Admiral Ironwave]]: Parliamentary resistance stronger than anticipated. Local assets compromiseded or eliminated. Recommend acceleration to Phase 4. Modified subject integration proceeding at 87% success rate. Some rejection patterns observed in subjects with strong cultural identity or family connections. Recommend selective targeting in future operations. Ancient technology integration successful beyond expectations. Pressure manipulation weapons now operational and ready for fleet deployment. Estimated effectiveness: 95% casualty rate against unprotected populations. Diplomatic assessment: Aquabyssos leadership unlikely to accept reasonable terms voluntarily. Military solution remains preferred option. Timeline:
- H-18: Surface fleet arrives in operational area
- H-12: Final ultimatum delivered to Parliament
- H-6: Precision strikes on military targets
- H-0: Full invasion if compliance not achieved Recommendation: Begin psychological warfare immediately to demoralize resistance. Show them what we can accomplish to their cities. [CLASSIFICATION: EYES ONLY] ### Handout 12: [[Medical Assessment - [Modified Subjects]] EMERGENCY MEDICAL REPORT Dr. [[Marcus Wellspring, [Chief Medical]] [[Officer Subject Assessment - [Facility Survivors]]: PRIORITY CRITICAL ([[Immediate Treatment Required):
- [Senator Maria]] Tidecaller: Neural implants causing seizures
- [[Captain Jonas Strongcurrent: Rejection reaction to physical modifications - [Engineer Sarah]] Bubbleworks: Memory cascade failure PRIORITY HIGH (Stable but [[Requires Surgery):
- 8 ship crew members: Control implants removable
- 3 Parliament staff: Memory fragmentation but personality intact
- 2 civilian captives: Early stage modification, excellent recovery prospects PRIORITY MEDIUM (Long-term Rehabilitation):
- 7 subjects: Extensive modification, uncertain recovery
- 4 subjects: Personality integration issues
- 3 subjects: Physical modifications irreversible TERMINAL ([Beyond Current]] [[Medical Capability]]):
- 5 subjects: Complete personality dissolution
- 2 subjects: Catastrophic neural integration failure RECOBCENDATIONS: 1. Immediate evacuation to advanced medical facility
2. Establish rehabilitation center with specialized staff
3. Research collaboration with ancient memory systems
4. Psychological support for recovery subjects and families The modified subjects represent both our greatest success and our heaviest burden. Every person we save is a victory against the conspiracy, but every person we cannot save is a reminder of the price of our failure to stop this horror sooner. [CONFIDENTIAL MEDICAL DOCUMENT] - -- * In the crushing depths where ancient wisdom sleeps and modern ambition schemes, the party discovers that some knowledge comes at too high a price, and some victories are measured not in enemies defeated but in innocents saved. As they emerge from the abyss with the weight of terrible truths, they must prepare for a final confrontation that will determine the future of two worlds.* ## Player-[[Facing Summary Session 4 [Smuggler Base]] is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## [[Lore Details Legends speak of Session 4 [Smuggler Base]] as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Session 4 [[Smuggler Base. ## DM [Notes Play]] up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## [[Secret Connections]] * [Hidden from players]* Connected to [[The Veiled Alliance - Manipulate succession ## [Prophecy Connection]] Mentioned in [[The First Prophecy of Depths ## [See Also]] - Related content
