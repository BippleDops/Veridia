The Shadowfell turns visitors around until they become marooned in its twisted landscape. Lost sorrowswornâ€”often referred to as the Lostâ€”are representations of the anxiety and fear people experience when they can't find their way. These sorrowsworn appear desperate and panicked.

Lost sorrowsworn grasp at any creatures they can reach. A victim experiences a flood of fear and panic as its mind buckles under the fury of this assault. The harder a victim's allies fight to break the grasp, the more the victim suffers.
