## Description
Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty [[Arrows (20)|Arrows]], [[Crossbow Bolts (20)|Bolts]], or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen [[Javelin|Javelins]] or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, [[Quarterstaff]], or [[Spear|Spears]].

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.
