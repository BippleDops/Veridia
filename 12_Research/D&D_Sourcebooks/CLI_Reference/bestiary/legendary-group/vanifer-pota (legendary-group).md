## Lair actions
_Source: Princes of the Apocalypse_

If Vanifer is in the fire node while [[Imix Pota]] isn't, the tiefling can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Vanifer uses a lair action to cast one of her spells, up to 3rd level, without using components or a spell slot. She can't cast the same spell two rounds in a row, although she can continue to concentrate on a spell she previously cast using a lair action. Vanifer can take no other lair actions while [[conditions#Concentration|concentrating]] on a spell cast as a lair action. Her favorite use of this capability is casting [[fireball-xphb (spells)]] or [[Hypnotic Pattern Xphb]].

If Vanifer casts [[Misty Step Xphb]] using this lair action, she also draws the power of the fire node into herself. By doing so, she regains 15 (`3d8 + 2`) hit points.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
