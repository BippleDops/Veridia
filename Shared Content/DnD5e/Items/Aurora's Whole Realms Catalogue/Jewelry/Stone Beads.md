## Description
Carved in the Shou Lung empire, these jade beads are said to impart good luck and prosperity to the bearer. We have incorporated them into a necklace and a belt, your choice. Black satin cording completes the exotic look of each piece. Carved stone bead necklace or belt (specify): 40 gp apiece.

## Additional Details
These are indeed lucky beads; the symbol carved into them imparts the effects of a permanent protection from evil 10â€™ radius spell to the bearer.
