# Hungry Insects
## Overview
*Mechanical trap*
A large grate taking up a 10-foot-square area sits in the center of the ceiling. A tripwire stretched across the middle of the room looses a box of hungry insects hidden in the ceiling above.

The tripwire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns. A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the tripwire. A DC 15 Dexterity check made with thieves' tools breaks the tripwire harmlessly. A character without thieves' tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.

When the trap is triggered, all doors to the room immediately close and lock. The doors are iron (AC 19, 27 hit points) and any character with thieves' tools can pick the lock with a DC 20 Dexterity check. A character without thieves' tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using a hairpin, wire, or other thin, metal tool.

When the trap triggers four swarms of insects fall from the grate in the ceiling and attack.
