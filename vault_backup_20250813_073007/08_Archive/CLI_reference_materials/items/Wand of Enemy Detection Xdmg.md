# Wand of Enemy Detection
*Wand, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/wand-of-enemy-detection.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action to expend 1 charge. For 1 minute, you know the direction of the nearest creature [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hostile-attitude-xphb|Hostile]] to you within 60 feet, but not its distance from you. The wand can sense the presence of [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hostile-attitude-xphb|Hostile]] creatures that are [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Invisible|Invisible]], ethereal, disguised, or hidden, as well as those in plain sight. The effect ends if you stop holding the wand.

## Regaining Charges

The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll `d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
