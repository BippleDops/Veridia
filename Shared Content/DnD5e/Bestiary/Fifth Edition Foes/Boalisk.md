## Special Traits

Creatures with black rot can't spend hit dice to recover lost hit points. A diseased character repeats the Con saving throw at the end of every long rest. On a failed saving throw, the disease continues. With a successful saving throw, the disease ends. The disease can also be cured with a lesser restoration spell.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Warm forest, aquatic

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
The boalisk is a vile serpent that lurks in misty jungles and along dark riverbanks. It can cause a disease with its gaze that prevents a body from healing itself.

A boalisk is a constrictor snake 12 to 30 feet long with dark scales interspersed with pale green and yellow daubs of color to help it blend in with its surroundings. The eyes of a boalisk are large and reddish in color.

A boalisk hunts by grabbing prey with its mouth and then squeezing with its powerful body. More powerful opponents (or if the boalisk has recently eaten) will be attacked with the boalisk’s gaze attack.

## Additional Details
