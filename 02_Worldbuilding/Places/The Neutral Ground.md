*Where All Currents Meet in Peace*

> *"Here stands proof that even in the crushing depths, reason can prevail over force. Let no weapon be drawn, no harsh word spoken, for this is sacred ground to all who seek understanding."*

## Overview

The Neutral Ground serves as [[Aquabyssos]]'s premier diplomatic facility, a carefully maintained zone where representatives from all factions, cities, and even surface realms can meet on equal terms.

## Secrets and Hidden Aspects

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Founding Sacrifice
> The magical neutrality protecting the Neutral Ground is powered by a sacrifice made 300 years ago. Seven volunteer diplomats from the founding factions permanently bound their souls to the facility, giving up their individuality to become the consciousness that enforces neutrality. They still exist as a collective mind maintaining the peace, but this truth is known only to the Mediator Supreme. The magic will fail if this secret is revealed, as it depends on the willing sacrifice remaining truly voluntary.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Deep Influence
> The [[Deep Mother]]'s dreams occasionally influence the Neutral Ground, subtly affecting negotiations in ways that serve her unknowable purposes. Some historic treaty terms that seemed inexplicably favorable to certain parties were actually influenced by the cosmic entity's sleeping mind. The current Mediator Supreme is beginning to suspect this influence but hasn't been able to prove it.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Future Archive
> Hidden in the deepest levels of the facility is a chamber containing memories of negotiations that haven't happened yet. These prophetic memories show possible future diplomatic outcomes, and the Neutrality Council uses them to subtly guide negotiations toward better results. However, the future memories are becoming increasingly dark and apocalyptic, suggesting that some approaching crisis may be beyond diplomatic solution.
