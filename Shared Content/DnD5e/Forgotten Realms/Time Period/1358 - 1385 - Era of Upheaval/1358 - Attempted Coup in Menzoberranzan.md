# 1358 - Attempted Coup in Menzoberranzan
## Overview
**Date**: Sunday, 1 January 1358 12:00:00 AM

In the underground [[Drow|drow]] city of [[Menzoberranzan]], the psionicists of House Oblodra were the only dark elves to retain their magical abilities during the [[1358 - Time of Troubles|Time of Troubles]] and attempted to seize power. However, Lolth, the main goddess of the [[Drow|drow]], made a deal with the [[Balor|balor]] Errtu, and [[Demons|demons]] were sent to assist House Baenre, the First House of [[Menzoberranzan]], and the cityâ€™s other ruling Houses in order to prevent the heretical Oblodrans from gaining power. Following the [[1358 - Time of Troubles|Time of Troubles]], Lolth granted Matron Mother Yvonnel Baenre, the unofficial ruler of [[Menzoberranzan]], the power to destroy House Oblodra. Yvonnel summoned a giant tentacle from the Abyss that swept the entire House Oblodra complex into the chasm known as the Clawrift.
