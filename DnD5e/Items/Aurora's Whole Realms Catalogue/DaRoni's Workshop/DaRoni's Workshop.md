# DaRoni's Workshop
## Overview
In the wilds outside of High Horn lives a peculiar gnomish hermit named Nadul DaRoni. Hermit though he may be, he does not live alone: his sprawling hermitage is peopled with ramshackle devices of wood and [[Metal|metal]], massive and wobbly worktables, racks of unidentifiable tools, and countless bits of curled parchment, which are piled up like snow across everything. Madman, perhaps; genius, perhaps; annoying, most definitely. He cornered me once at an affair Elminster was hosting in [[Shadowdale]] and all but demanded admittance to my catalogue. At first I refused him outright, but after continual pestering, I finally took a look at his manuscripts, and was amazed. My curiosity landed me a week later in his workshop where I was subjected to endless anecdotes and theories from the dear old creature. At last, I said that if he were to write up some of his inventions following my format, I would allow him five pages. Next month I received a package with 97 such pages, and have since narrowed them down to a dozen or so. At the outset of this section, I believe it only fair to warn buyers that they must beware of this merchandise. These machines are as untrustworthy as they are peculiar, though all of them smack of a genius little encountered in our world these days. Note that all the [[Items|items]] here must be special ordered, with listed prices only vaguely reflecting what Nadul DaRoni will end up charging. And finally, the tight-fisted buyer may as well pass over this section entirely. Remember, too, his Common is not well developed.
