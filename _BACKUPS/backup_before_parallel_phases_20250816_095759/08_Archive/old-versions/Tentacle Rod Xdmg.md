--- # Tentacle Rod

*Rod, rare (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/tentacle-rod.webp#right) - **Weight**: 2.0 lbs. This rod ends in three rubbery tentacles. While holding the rod, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic action to direct the tentacles to stretch outward, each one attacking a creature you can see within 15 feet of yourself. For each tentacle, make a melee attack roll with a +9 bonus. A tentacle deals`d6`Psychic damage on a hit. If you hit the same target with all three tentacles, the target must succeed on a **DC 15** Dexterity saving throw or have the [conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition until you have the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated condition, until you take a [Action Xphb]] to release the target, or until the target is no longer within 15 feet of you. While [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] in this way, the target takes``dice: 3d6``Psychic damage at the start of each of its turns. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 316* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Tentacle rod xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
