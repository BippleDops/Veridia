# Void Moan

The wind stops. A pressure like silence pushes against your thoughts.

What you feel
- Ringing in the ears
- A sudden sense of being very small

What you can try
- Steady each other with a song or prayer
- Keep busy at your post

Possible outcomes
- You shrug it off together
- Someone freezes up
- The quiet gets inside
