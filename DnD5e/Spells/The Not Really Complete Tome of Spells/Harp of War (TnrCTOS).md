A seven-stringed harp made of glowing silver light appears in mid-air in front of you. It hovers immovably, allowing you to leave it there if you need to do something else. Each round, you may pluck one of its strings and release a power—you are aware of the power associated with each string. The powers are as follows:

♦ ***Flame Strike.*** You call down a column of fire on one creature within 60 feet, who must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 9d6 fire damage on a failed saving throw or half as much damage on a successful one.

♦ ***Lightning Bolt.*** You may fire a bolt of lightning at one creature within 60 feet, who must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 9d6 lightning damage on a failed saving throw or half as much damage on a successful one.

♦ ***Scatter.*** You may teleport all magical items within a 30-foot radius to random locations within 1 mile. If the object is held or carried by a creature, that creature may make a Strength saving throw to hang on.

♦ ***Shatter.*** All nonmagical inanimate objects within a 30-foot radius take 5d10 force damage; an item reduced to 0 hit points shatters.

♦ ***Summoning.*** You summon four pegasi who will fight on your behalf or provide transport for up to 1 hour.

♦ ***Teleport.*** You choose up to 11 creatures within a 30-foot radius and teleport them to a random location within 1 mile. If the creatures are unwilling, they may make a Wisdom saving throw to resist.

♦ ***Wall of Stone.*** You cause a wall of stone to erupt up from the ground. The wall is 6 inches long and composed of ten 10-foot by 10-foot panels, each of which must be touching at least one other panel.

Each string can be plucked once and van-ishes after its been used. When the last string vanishes, so does the harp.
