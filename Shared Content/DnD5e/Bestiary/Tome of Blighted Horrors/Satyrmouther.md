## Special Traits
**Magic Resistance:** The satyrmouther has tactical advantage on saves against magic.

**Ravenous Embrace:** At the start of the satyrmouther’s turn, a creature that is grappling the satyrmouther or is grappled by it takes `dice: 2d4` piercing damage plus `dice: 2d6` necrotic damage.

**Suasive Song:** A satyrmouther can sing a cacophony of maddening sound (no action required). All creatures other than aberrations within 60 feet that hear the song must make a DC 13 Wis saving throw. For each creature that fails, roll `dice: 1d4` to determine the effect: 1 = confusion (per the spell), 2 = incapacitated (by despair), 3 = unconscious, 4 = frightened. An affected creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself with a success. The effect ends automatically if the satyrmouther stops, or is prevented from, singing. A creature that saves successfully is immune to the Suasive Song of satyrmouthers for 24 hours.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The satyrmouther makes two attacks, each of which must be different, all while singing its Suasive Song.

**Melee Attack—Shortsword:** +4 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d6 + 2` piercing damage.

**Melee Attack—Head-butt:** +4 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d4 + 2` bludgeoning damage.

**Ranged Attack—Shortbow:** +4 to hit (range 80 ft./320 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d6 + 2` piercing damage.

**Ranged Attack—Spittle (recharge 5-6):** automatic hit (range 30 ft.; one creature). Hit: the creature must make a successful DC 13 Con saving throw or be blinded for `dice: 1d4` rounds.

## Description
**Environment**: Underground (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary

The satyrmouther is a strange and rare mix of aberration and fey. It sings songs that madden, sadden, lull, and terrify. Unlike a satyr, the creature is interested only in fostering negative emotions, lying, and bullying; it disdains charm and diplomatic persuasion. And unlike a gibbering mouther, it’s a being of insidious intellect whose mouths sing and manipulate rather than simply inducing temporary insanity.
