Dr. Truthseeker works 16-hour days and sleeps in his office more often than at home. His personal quarters contain shrine dedicated to his crystallized daughter, whose transformed body he keeps hoping to someday restore. *Current Focus:* Coordinating between competing research teams and managing political pressure from the Crown and merchant guilds. #### Dr. Marina Crystalseeker - Senior Research Scientist **Age:** 34 **Background:** Former crystal mining engineer, immune to Stage 0-1 infection **Specialization:** Advanced crystalline pathology **Personal Risk:** Deliberately exposes herself to controlled plague samples The only researcher permitted to work directly with Stage 4-5 specimens. Her natural immunity makes her invaluable but also isolates her from colleagues who fear her potential to carry dormant infections. *Current Project:* Mapping the complete crystalline transformation process at the cellular level. Her notes are written in a mixture of common script and crystalline growth patterns that only she can fully interpret. #### Dr. Elena Harmonybane - Sonic Therapy Researcher **Age:** 28 **Background:** Former naval sonar specialist and bard college graduate **Specialization:** Acoustic disruption of crystal formations **Equipment:** Custom-built harmonic resoce laboratory Dr. Harmonybane's research combines magic and science in unprecedented ways. Her laboratory features a concert hall-sized chamber where she tests various musical frequencies against crystal samples. *Breakthrough Discovery:* Certain combinations of bardic magic and mechanical resoce can cause Stage 1-2 crystals to dissolve. Side effects include severe migraine headaches and temporary loss of magical ability. *Personal Note:* She composes healing songs during off-hours, some of which have shown remarkable success in [[Crystal Plague Wards patient comfort care. #### Chairman: High Magistrate Aurelius Goldscale **Responsibilities:**

- Approving human experimentation protocols
- Investigating researcher misconduct
- Balancing scientific progress with patient rights
- Managing public relations around controversial research **Current Controversies:**
- Dr. Voidwise's self-infection experiment approval

"The pressure chambers hurt like being crushed by a giant's fist, but my crystals stopped growing. I'll take pain over transformation any day." #### The Kelp Forest Discovery **Research Lead:** Marine Botanist Dr. Coral Plantwise **Finding:** Certain deep-sea kelp varieties produce compounds that neutralize crystal growth **Current Status:** Attempting to synthesize active compounds for mass production **Challenge:** Kelp only grows at specific depths with particular magical current conditions *Production Notes:*

- One dose requires 50 pounds of rare kelp
- Harvest operations risk diver contamination
- [Crystal Cult Temples]] have begun targeting kelp forests
- Alternative cultivation methods under development ### Daily Operations **6:00 AM - Depth Synchronization**

*Coordinated by: Royal Cartographer's Guild* **Scope:** Map correlation between plague outbreaks and geographic/magical factors **Findings:** Plague clusters near ancient crystal mining sites **Implications:** Historical crystal extraction may have weakened natural barriers **Status:** 60% complete, expanding to include undersea surveys **The Unified Treatment Protocol** *Lead Institution: Rotating quarterly* **Goal:** Develop standardized treatment procedures for all medical facilities **Challenge:** Balancing different institutional approaches and philosophies **Progress:** Basic procedures established for Stages 1-3 **Controversy:** Disagreement over Stage 4-5 treatment ethics #### The Funding Wars

Competition for limited research funds has created tension between institutions: - **Academic Institutions** argue for pure research approaches
- **Medical Facilities** demand focus on immediate treatment improvements - **Religious Organizations** claim divine guidance supersedes scientific method
- **Military Research** prioritizes weaponization studies over cure development *Recent Incident:* Dr. Marina Crystalseeker's request for rare crystal samples was denied when three other institutions submitted competing requests for the same materials. #### The Information Sharing Debate **Open Science Faction** *Leader: Dr. Lysander Truthseeker* - Advocates complete transparency between all research institutions

- Believes collaboration will accelerate cure discovery
- Opposes military classification of research data
- Supports including [Crystal Cult Temples]] researchers **Security Faction** *Leader: Royal Medical Advisor Dr. Victoria Crownwright* - Argues sensitive information could be misused by hostile forces
- Supports compartmentalized research for security
- Opposes sharing with crystal cult organizations
- Advocates military oversight of dangerous experiments **Compromise Position** *Mediator: High Cleric Nerida Seawright* - Supports limited information sharing with oversight
- Proposes ethics review for sensitive research
- Advocates transparent publication of successful treatments
- Suggests international cooperation within security frameworks ### The Rogue Scientists Alliance **Formation:** Frustrated researchers who left official institutions **Leader:** Dr. Marcus Shadowmend (expelled from Royal Academy) **Membership:** 12 known researchers, unknown number of supporters **Funding:** [[Black Market Crystal Trade sales of experimental treatments **Ethics:** Willing to use methods official institutions consider unacceptable #### Hidden Laboratory - "The Deep Lab" **Location:** Abandoned mine shaft beneath Port Meridian **Security:** Magical concealment and physical traps **Equipment:** Stolen and improvised research apparatus **Subjects:** Voluntary patients seeking experimental treatments The Rogue Scientists conduct research banned by official ethics boards:

- Terminal experimentation on willing Stage 5 patients
- Untested treatments on desperate families
- Reverse-engineering [Crystal Cult Temples]] transformation rituals
- Developing enhancement procedures that embrace rather than cure crystallization *Dr. Shadowmend's Philosophy:* "Official channels move too slowly while people die. Sometimes healing requires breaking a few rules." #### Notable Underground Experiments **Project Phoenix Rising**

Attempting to reverse Stage 5 transformation through combination of divine magic, alchemical processes, and raw determination. Success rate: 0%, but subjects report spiritual experiences during attempts. **Project Symbiosis** Investigating controlled crystallization that preserves human consciousness while gaining crystal abilities. Three volunteers currently participating in extended trials. **Project Viral Warfare**

Developing ways to weaponize plague research against [[Crystal Cult Temples and foreign enemies. Strictly compartmentalized due to extreme danger. ### The Cult Infiltrators **Network:** [Crystal Cult Temples]] members working within official research institutions **Goal:** Sabotage cure development while stealing research for cult purposes **Methods:** Data theft, experiment contamination, researcher recruitment **Detection:** Ongoing counter-intelligence operations #### Known Incidents **The Harmonybane Sabotage**

Dr. Elena Harmonybane's resoce equipment was damaged by cult infiltrators who considered her work "blasphemous interference with divine transformation." **The Sample Contamination**

Research specimens were deliberately infected with concentrated plague samples, ruining months of careful cultivation work and exposing several researchers to infection. **The Data Theft**

Complete patient records were stolen from the Central Library, presumably to identify potential cult recruits among plague victims. ### Research Funding Crisis **Total Annual Research Costs:** 500,000 gold pieces **Royal Emergency Funding:** 200,000 gold pieces **Private Donations:** 150,000 gold pieces **International Aid:** 100,000 gold pieces **Funding Gap:** 50,000 gold pieces (growing annually) #### Budget Pressures **Equipment Costs**

- Crystal-safe laboratory equipment costs 300% more than standard medical apparatus
- Magical containment systems require constant maintece and magical component replacement
- Specialized reagents for plague research are increasingly rare and expensive **Staffing Challenges**
- Hazard pay for researchers working with dangerous specimens
- High turnover due to infection risk and stress
- Competition with [[Black Market Crystal Trade organizations offering higher salaries
- Training costs for new researchers in specialized plague protocols **Facility Maintece**
- Crystal contamination requires extensive facility decontamination
- Security systems need constant upgrades to prevent cult infiltration
- Emergency medical systems for researcher safety
- Insurance costs for high-risk research operations ### Economic Opportunities **Patent Development**

Research institutions compete to develop patentable treatments and detection methods. Successful cure development could generate enormous wealth for the discoverer. **International Licensing**

Foreign nations pay substantial fees for access to Aquabyssos plague research data. This revenue helps offset research costs but raises questions about information equity. **Medical Tourism**

Wealthy plague victims from other regions travel to access cutting-edge treatments. This generates revenue but strains already limited medical resources. ### The Sabotaged Experiment

A crucial experiment that could lead to a cure has been sabotaged, setting back research by months. Investigation reveals a complex web of competing interests - [Crystal Cult Temples]] infiltrators, foreign spies, and rival research institutions all had motives. ### The Ethical Dilemma

A researcher has discovered a potential cure, but testing it requires sacrificing a group of Stage 4 patients. The ethics board is deadlocked, and desperate families are demanding action while patient advocates protest the exploitation. ### The Stolen Samples

Irreplaceable plague specimens have been stolen from the high-security containment lab. The thieves left behind clues suggesting they plan to weaponize the samples. Time is running out to prevent a deliberate plague outbreak. ### The Volunteer Crisis

Research has ground to a halt due to lack of volunteer test subjects. Investigating the cause reveals someone has been threatening potential volunteers, but whether it's cult intimidation, government pressure, or rival institution interference remains unclear. ### The Breakthrough Discovery

A young researcher has made a revolutionary discovery but refuses to share it with the official research community. Investigation reveals she's being blackmailed by someone who wants to control the cure for their own purposes. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A shipment has gone missing and truth emerges
