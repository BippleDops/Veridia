## Description

Fane-Eater is a battleaxe belonging to [[Arkhan the Cruel]].

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls with Fane-Eater. If you attack a creature with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, the creature takes an extra `dice: 2d8` necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to the necrotic damage taken.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
