--- # Prismatic Spray

*7th-level, Evocation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot Cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous Eight rays of light flash from you in a 60-foot [[Area of Effect Xphb. Each creature in the [Area of Effect Xphb]] makes a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll`d8`to determine which color ray affects it, consulting the Prismatic Rays table. **Prismatic Rays**`dice: [](prismatic-spray-xphb.md#^prismatic-rays)`| dice: `dice: 1d8` | Ray |

|-----------|-----|
| 1 | **Red.** *Failed Save:*``dice: 12d6``Fire damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 2 | **Orange.** *Failed Save:*``dice: 12d6``Acid damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 3 | **Yellow.** *Failed Save:*``dice: 12d6``Lightning damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 4 | **Green.** *Failed Save:*``dice: 12d6``Poison damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 5 | **Blue.** *Failed Save:*``dice: 12d6``Cold damage. *Successful Save:* Half as much damage. |
| 6 | **Indigo.** *Failed Save:* The target has the [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained condition and makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the condition ends. If it fails three times, it has the [conditions#Petrified|Petrified]] condition until it is freed by an effect like the [[greater-restoration-xphb (spells) spell. The successes and failures needn't be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of a kind. |
| 7 | **Violet.** *Failed Save:* The target has the [conditions#Blinded|Blinded]] condition and makes a Wisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the condition ends. On a failed save, the condition ends, and the creature teleports to another plane of existence (DM's choice). |
| 8 | **Special.** The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice, rerolling any 8. |

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of prismatic spray xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around prismatic spray xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Covenant - Control trade routes ## Plot Hooks - Someone is blackmailing an heir for power
