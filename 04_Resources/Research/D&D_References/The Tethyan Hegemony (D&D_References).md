**The Slow Erosion of Power**

While the Hegemony remained powerful, internal problems and external pressures gradually weakened its control. **Internal Challenges:**
- **Succession Disputes**: Multiple claimants to the Crown of Tides
- **Regional Autonomy**: Outer territories increasingly ignored central authority
- **Economic Strain**: Maintaining the vast fleet became ficially unsustainable
- **Cultural Fragmentation**: Different regions developed distinct identities and interests
- **Magical Decay**: Ancient magical infrastructure began failing without proper maintece **External Pressures:**
- **Rising Continental Powers**: Land-based empires developed their own naval capabilities

- **Population Training**: Teaching citizens underwater survival skills
- **Strategic Resources**: Stockpiling food, materials, and magical supplies
- **Alliance Building**: Seeking cooperation with formerly hostile powers **The Prophetic Visions (756 BGD)**

Tethyan seers and oracles began experiencing consistent visions of a "Great Drowning" that would transform the world. Initially dismissed as fantasy, these visions became increasingly detailed and consistent across multiple sources. **Emperor Pelagic the Last (234-1 BGD)**

The final emperor focused entirely on survival preparation, using all remaining Hegemony resources to create the infrastructure that would eventually become Aquabyssos. ### Political Structure

**The Crown of Tides**

Recently discovered documents suggest that the "Great Preparation" was not Emperor Abyssal's desperate reaction to decline, but part of a centuries-long plan. Evidence indicates that Tethyan leaders knew about the coming Great Drowning at least 400 years before it occurred and deliberately orchestrated the Hegemony's apparent decline to prepare for survival in the new world. ### The Hidden Fleet

Intelligence reports suggest that a significant portion of the Tethyan Navy was not destroyed during the Great Drowning but was instead deliberately hidden in deep ocean trenches. This "Lost Fleet" may still exist, complete with ancient technology and crew members preserved through magical means, waiting for the right moment to return. ### The Successor States

While Aquabyssos is the most visible successor to the Tethyan Hegemony, at least three other civilizations claim direct descent from the empire. These hidden kingdoms may possess different aspects of Tethyan knowledge and technology, potentially making them powerful allies or dangerous rivals. ### The Deep Archives

Beneath the ruins of the Crystal Palace lies a vast underground complex containing the complete records of the Tethyan Hegemony. These archives allegedly include detailed plans for rebuilding the empire, advanced magical techniques, and intelligence on threats from other dimensions. Access to these archives is restricted by both magical barriers and government secrecy. ### The Continuity Protocol

Classified government documents reference a "Continuity Protocol" established by the last Tethyan emperor. This protocol supposedly includes instructions for reconstituting the Hegemony when conditions are favorable, complete with pre-positioned resources, sleeper agents, and magical triggers that could activate throughout Aquabyssos. ### The Lost Chronicle

Archaeologists have discovered references to a missing volume of the **Imperial Chronicle of Deep History** that supposedly contains detailed accounts of the Great Drowning preparation. The characters must locate this chronicle while competing with various factions who want to claim or destroy it. ### The Awakened Admiral

A Tethyan Admiral-General has awakened from magical stasis after nearly 900 years and believes the Hegemony still exists. The characters must help this displaced leader understand the modern world while dealing with their attempts to "restore proper order" to Aquabyssos. ### The Deep Fleet Rising

Signs suggest that elements of the lost Tethyan Navy are beginning to surface, complete with crews who preserveded in magical stasis. The characters must determine whether these forces represent salvation or conquest for modern Aquabyssos. ### The Succession Crisis

A previously unknown heir to the Tethyan throne has appeared with seemingly legitimate claims to rule Aquabyssos as the successor state to the Hegemony. The characters must investigate these claims while navigating the political chaos caused by this challenge to current authority. ### The Crystal Palace Awakening

The ancient magical systems in the Crystal Palace ruins have suddenly reactivated, creating dangerous magical phenomena throughout Meridian. The characters must enter the palace, navigate its restored defenses, and discover what has triggered this awakening. ### The Trade War

A powerful merchant consortium has discovered Tethyan trade routes and navigation secrets, using them to dominate Aquabyssos commerce. The characters must investigate this group while dealing with the economic disruption caused by their activities. ### The Deep Archive Expedition
