# Trap #21 - "Poke, Grapple, Wrestle, And Chomp: Personal Injuries A Specialty!"
## Overview
The [[Orc (D&D 5e SRD)|Orc]] attacks the party and the [[Goblin (D&D 5e SRD)|Goblin]] chases them.

**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The action at this point speeds up greatly. If by some miracle the party is still in the boat it will meet the same fate, but lets deal with the "floaters" first. When the would-be tomb robbers reach the curtain they will become aware that just beyond the chain the water plunges off a cliff. This is one of the sources of the roaring water noise that was heard in the grotto room. Swept into the chains, a swimmers instinct alone will impel him or her to grab onto them.
> 
> "Floaters" or boaters, if they do not grab onto the chains, will fall 100 feet to their great discomfort in the pool that awaits below. There is a 30% chance (L3) of being drowned. This will result from the depth of the plunge, or from being stunned by the impact Armored characters will have to boost that to 50% (LS) for the obvious reason. Ifno one grabs the chains in the crew of a boat, or none of the "floaters" have grabbed the chains, then the boat will survive the fall intact: everyone will be dumped out but the boat will be fine.
> 
> Enough of this gloomy speculation, they are bound to grab the chains in desperation. Now the real fun begins. Instead of finding a semisafe place to pause and reflect on their current predicament, the delvers will find that the chains are anything but secure. There will be an initial pause, then the chain will begin to play out down the face of the falls. The lip of the falls is undercut so that even if the delvers can manage to swing through the torrent they will encounter nothing but more water on the back swing. The chains will play out about 20 feet, just enough to allow the torrent to pound the would-be tomb robber senseless, but still 80 feet above the pool below, where the chain will stop unreeling.
> 
> At this point the options seem to be to hang here and be pounded by the water, attempt to climb back up in the face of the torrent on a slippery chain, or trust to luck and drop into the pool. If the boat went over first, or other swimmers have made the plunge first the last altemacive might not look impossible. Keep in mind that the only light in this cavern is from a few (very few) patches of bioluminescent lichens. This will serve to outline objects but not to illuminate things. Torches will be needed to make enlightened decisions.
> 
> Alas, what fools these delvers be. When the chain played out it also served to raise a bed of spikes up under the falls. Not too far up, only to within a foot of the surface of the pool. Zip-splat! Delver Kabobs with fresh sea food - my favorite. An interesting variation would be to have the chain break off once the spears are locked in place.
> 
> At this point I must inject a brief editorial statement. You might think that tomb operation in this enlightened time would be relatively free of the craven interference by lobby groups, special labor representatives and such like vermin. Not so! This tomb being a masterpiece of the trap masters art needs very few "live" monsters. As a resull of this my offices were beset by picketers from The Brotherhood of Very Large Vermin Local 666. (You haven't lived until you have seen a cadre of Dragons, Land Sharks, Tyranosauri, and Giant Gastropods holding Unfair to Labor Signs. It was enough lopul ME off my lunch.) So without further ado the Lurker Past the Threshold part of this Trap. (What the hey, the room was big enough and just going to waste).
> 
> The pool is 70 feet across and 100 feet wide, and deep enough that even with a de termined effort the bottom cannot be found. In the inky depths can be found a life form that will find the thrashing and struggling of the delvers very interesting in a gustatory way. A giant albino cave squid lurks at the bottom of the pool. As it thrives on the occasional passing shark, or barricuda, a few foundering delvers will prove just the thing to draw an exploratory tentacle up from the icy depths.
> 
> If the party can get back in their boat fast and paddle, or if the boat has been impaled, and they elect to swim for the exit they will only have to deal with a few probing tentacles. If they lollygag about noticing for the moment the dearth of predatory cave critters, they will be confronted by the spelunkers answer to Leviathan! (The tentacles alone would be marginally tough, but the entire 8 tentacles and 2 elongated grappling arms will be in my humble estimation a lethal combination without the application of very unusual means.
> 
> In this case quick recovery from the fall and quicker departure is the most likely key to having the tomb robbers prolong our fun.
> 
> The whole room rates four skulls, with the <censored> monster. The spears at the bottom of the fall pulled up by the frantic delvers is a realy nice touch.
