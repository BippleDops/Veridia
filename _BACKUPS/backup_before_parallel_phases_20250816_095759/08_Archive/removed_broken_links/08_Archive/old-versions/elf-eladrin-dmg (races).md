--- # Elf (Eladrin)

*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 286* - **Ability Scores**: int +1
- **Size**: Medium
- **Speed**: 30 ft.
- **Spellcasting**: Charisma ### Age Although elves reach physical maturity at about the same age as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old. ### Size Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium. ### Darkvision Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. ### Keen Senses You have proficiency in the [[skills#Perception|Perception skill. ### Fey Ancestry You have advantage on saving throws against being [conditions#Charmed|charmed]], and magic can't put you to sleep. ### Trance Elves don't need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is "trance.") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep. > [!note]

> If you meditate during a long rest, you finish the rest after only 4 hours. You otherwise obey all the rules for a long rest; only the duration is changed. ### Languages You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires. ### Elf Weapon Training You have proficiency with the [[Longsword Xphb, [shortsword-xphb (items)]], [[shortbow-xphb (items), and [longbow-xphb (items)]]. ### Fey Step You can cast the [[Misty Step Xphb]] spell once using this trait. You regain the ability to do so when you finish a short or long rest. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Elf eladrin dmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of elf eladrin dmg as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around elf eladrin dmg. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
