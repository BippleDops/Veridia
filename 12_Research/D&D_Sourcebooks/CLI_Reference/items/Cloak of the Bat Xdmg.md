# Cloak of the Bat
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  



While wearing this cloak, you have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on Dexterity ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Stealth|Stealth]]) checks. In an area of [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] or [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/darkness-xphb|Darkness]], you can grip the edges of the cloak and use it to gain a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/fly-speed-xphb|Fly Speed]] of 40 feet. If you ever fail to grip the cloak's edges while flying in this way, or if you are no longer in [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] or [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/darkness-xphb|Darkness]], you lose this [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/fly-speed-xphb|Fly Speed]].

While wearing the cloak in an area of [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] or [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/darkness-xphb|Darkness]], you can cast [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/polymorph-xphb|Polymorph]] on yourself, shape-shifting into a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/bat-xmm|Bat]]. While in that form, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The cloak can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
