## Special Traits
***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5+the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.

## Actions
***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (`dice: 4d6`) piercing damage.

***Eye Ray.*** The zombie uses a random magical eye ray, choosing a target that it can see within 60 feet of it.

1. Paralyzing Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
1. Fear Ray. The targeted creature must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
1. Enervation Ray. The targeted creature must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (`dice: 8d8`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
1. Disintegration Ray. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 45 (`dice: 10d8`) force damage. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, its body becomes a pile of fine gray dust.

If the target is a Large or smaller nonmagical object or creation of magical force, it is disintegrated without a saving throw. If the target is a Huge or larger nonmagical object or creation of magical force, this ray disintegrates a 10-foot cube of it.
