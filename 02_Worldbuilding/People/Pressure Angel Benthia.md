# Pressure Angel Benthia
*Guardian of the Depths, Herald of Divine Weight*

## Overview
Benthia is one of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]]'s Pressure Angelsâ€”divine beings born from the intersection of the goddess's will and the crushing depths of the ocean. She serves as guardian of critical pressure points where the Deep Mother's influence is strongest, manifesting as both protector and test for those who would approach the deepest mysteries. Unlike mortal servants, she is pure divine force given form, embodying the Deep Mother's power over pressure, depth, and the weight of existence itself.
