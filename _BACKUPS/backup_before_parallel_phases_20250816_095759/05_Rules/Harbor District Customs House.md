These shipments contain dangerous [[Crystal Corruption]] research materials that would be illegal for anyone else to import. Magnus is torn between his duty to the law and his loyalty to the crown, and is keeping detailed secret records of all exempted shipments in case he needs to protect himself politically.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Double Agent
> [[Senior Investigator Shadow Trackhound is actually a double agent working for a [Foreign Intelligence]] service while maintaining his position in customs. He feeds information about Aethermoor's trade relationships and security procedures to his handlers while conducting legitimate anti-smuggling work to maintain his cover. His foreign contacts provide him with intelligence that makes him extremely effective at his job, creating a complex moral situation.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Crystal Communication Network
> The customs house's crystal communication system has been compromised by [[12 Research, who have found a way to intercept and decode official communications.
