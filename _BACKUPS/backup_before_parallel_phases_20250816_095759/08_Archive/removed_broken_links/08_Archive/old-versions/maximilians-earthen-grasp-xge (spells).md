--- # Maximilian's Earthen Grasp

*2nd-level, Transmutation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature hand sculpted from clay)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute You choose a 5-foot-square unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within range. A Medium hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for one creature you can see within 5 feet of it. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes``dice: 2d6``bludgeoning damage and is [[conditions#Restrained|restrained for the spell's duration. As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the [conditions#Restrained|restrained]] target, which must make a Strength saving throw. The target takes``dice: 2d6``bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. To break out, the [[conditions#Restrained|restrained target can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target escapes and is no longer [conditions#Restrained|restrained]] by the hand. As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different creature or to move to a different unoccupied space within range. The hand releases a [[conditions#Restrained|restrained target if you do either. **Classes**: [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 161* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Maximilians earthen grasp xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
