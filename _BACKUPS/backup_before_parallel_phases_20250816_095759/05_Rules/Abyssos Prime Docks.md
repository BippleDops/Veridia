The vault contains artifacts and knowledge that could revolutionize underwater construction, but also dangerous weapons that could threaten the entire city if misused. The harbormaster has been secretly studying these artifacts while trying to decide whether to reveal their existence to the crown.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The [[Smuggler's Network
> A sophisticated smuggling network operates within the port, using a combination of corrupted officials, hidden passages in the old harbor foundations, and magical concealment to move illegal goods. The network is led by someone within the port administration itself, and has connections to [Criminal_Organizations|Criminal Organizations]] throughout Aquabyssos. The operation is so well-organized that it actually helps port operations run more smoothly while evading detection.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Deep Harbor Entity
> Something ancient and intelligent lives in the deepest parts of the harbor, a creature that has existed since before the port was built.
