# Chain
*Adventuring gear*  


- **Cost**: 5 gp
- **Weight**: 10.0 lbs.

As a [Utilize](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Utilize) action, you can wrap a Chain around an unwilling creature within 5 feet of yourself that has the [Grappled](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Grappled), [Incapacitated](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Incapacitated), or [Restrained](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Restrained) condition if you succeed on a DC 13 Strength ([Athletics](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Athletics)) check. If the creature's legs are bound, the creature has the [Restrained](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Restrained) condition until it escapes. Escaping the Chain requires the creature to make a successful DC 18 Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check as an action. Bursting the Chain requires a successful DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Athletics)) check as an action.
