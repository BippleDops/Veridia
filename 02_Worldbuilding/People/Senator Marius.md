## Overview
Senator Marcus Marius represents the progressive wing of Aquabyssos's Parliament, a charismatic sea elf whose impassioned speeches and reform agenda have made him both a beloved champion of the common people and a target for conservative factions. Born into minor nobility but raised with commoners after his family's disgrace, Marcus combines aristocratic education with genuine understanding of ordinary citizens' struggles.

## Physical Description & Background
At 5'9" with the graceful build typical of sea elves, Marcus has flowing silver-blue hair and deep green eyes that flash with conviction when he speaks. Unlike many senators, he dresses modestly and often wears a simple pendant bearing the symbol of Aquabyssos's founding principles. Scars on his hands tell the story of his youth working alongside common laborers.

Born to House Tidespeaker, a minor noble family that lost their fortune defending commoners' rights, Marcus was raised understanding both privilege and poverty. His natural charisma and brilliant oratory skills earned him a seat in the Senate, where he champions democratic reforms, workers' rights, and government transparency.

## Special Abilities

**Inspiring Oratory.** Can cast *mass suggestion* once per day through passionate speech, affecting up to 12 creatures within 60 feet.

**Bardic Inspiration.** Can inspire allies with stirring words (Bardic Inspiration dice: d8, 4 uses per short rest).

**Silver Tongue.** Has advantage on all Persuasion checks and can reroll failed Charisma-based social encounters once per day.

**Political Protection.** As a sitting senator, has legal immunity from most criminal charges and can call for parliamentary protection.

**Spellcasting (9th level bard).** Spell save DC 16, +8 to hit. Known spells focus on enchantment, divination, and social manipulation.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** Makes two attacks with Ceremonial Sword or casts a spell and makes one attack.

**Ceremonial Sword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage. (Marcus prefers negotiation to combat)

**Rallying Speech (1/Day).** All allies within 60 feet gain 15 temporary hit points and advantage on their next ability check or saving throw.

**Parliamentary Immunity (3/Day).** Can invoke senatorial privilege to avoid consequences of social or legal challenges.
