# Smoke Grenade
*Explosive*  


- **Cost**: 50 gp
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

As an action, you can either throw a grenade at a point up to 60 feet away or use a Grenade Launcher to propel the grenade to a point up to 1,000 feet away. The grenade explodes at that point, creating a particular effect in a 20-foot-radius [[sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]].

The area of the [[sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]] is [[heavily-obscured-xphb|Heavily Obscured]] by smoke for 1 minute. A strong wind (such as the [[gust-of-wind-xphb|Gust of Wind]] spell) disperses the smoke.
