## 🌊 WORLD OVERVIEW

### The Dual Realms

**Aquabyssos - The Realm of Depths**  
A vast underwater kingdom where coral cities rise from abyssal plains, and where the pressure of the deep ocean has forged a culture of collective strength and unwavering honor. Here, the Parliament of Echoes governs through democratic deliberation, while ancient currents carry whispers of older powers stirring in the deepest trenches.

**Aethermoor - The Realm of Heights**  
A magnificent sky kingdom where floating cities dance among the clouds, held aloft by crystal technology and wind mastery. The people of Aethermoor value individual achievement and innovation, their culture shaped by the endless sky and the constant need to adapt to changing winds.

### The Connection

These realms exist in parallel, connected by mystical convergence points where water meets air, where pressure meets wind. Trade routes span between worlds through diplomatic vessels and magical gateways, allowing for cultural exchange, commerce, and the occasional diplomatic crisis.

**Current Era: The Crystal Convergence (1247 AC - Present)**  
Both realms have entered an age of unprecedented cooperation, sharing crystal technology and cultural knowledge. However, beneath this golden age of diplomacy, shadows stir. Reports of mysterious infiltrations and strange crystal corruptions hint at deeper conspiracies that threaten the stability of both worlds.
