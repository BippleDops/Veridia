--- > [!figure] Portrait # Sorrow-Root Nightbloom *"Nature doesn't need saving - it needs revenge. The crystals are a cancer, and I am the cure, no matter how much cutting is required."* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Once a member of [[The Verdant Accord, Sorrow-Root Nightbloom now leads the Withered Court, a radical splinter faction that believes the only way to save nature is to weaponize it against civilization. They've begun experimenting with controlled corruption to create "crystal-eating" plants. ## The Withered Court

A growing faction of druids, rangers, and fey who believe that:
- Civilization must fall for nature to survive
- Crystal corruption can be turned against itself
- The [The Seven Shards|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]] should be destroyed or corrupted beyond use
- Anyone who uses crystals deserves death ## DM Secrets

> [!warning] The Green Death

> Sorrow-Root has successfully created a fungal plague that feeds on crystal energy. Released in a populated area, it would kill anyone with any crystal exposure (nearly everyone) within days. They're waiting for the right moment to deploy it. > [!danger] The True Horror
> Sorrow-Root isn't entirely wrong - they've discovered that the crystals are actually eggs of an extraplanar parasite. Their extreme methods might be the only thing preventing an even worse catastrophe, making them a villain who might be accidentally saving the world. > [!info] Hidden Humanity
> Sorrow-Root maintains a secret garden where they keep one uncorrupted tree from their childhood home. If it dies or is corrupted, they plan to release the Green Death immediately. This tree is their last anchor to sanity. ## Stats

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Sorrow Root Nightbloom as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Sorrow Root Nightbloom. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Related Notes - [[Similar Topic 1
