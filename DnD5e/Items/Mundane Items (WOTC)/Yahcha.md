## Description: 
A yahcha (pronounced YAH-chah) is a harmless, meaty beetle about the size of a human hand, which feeds on worms and maggots. It moves slowly (walking speed 10 feet) and is easy to catch. A creature with blue mist fever that eats a raw or cooked yahcha can immediately make a saving throw with advantage against that disease (see "Diseases," page 40),
