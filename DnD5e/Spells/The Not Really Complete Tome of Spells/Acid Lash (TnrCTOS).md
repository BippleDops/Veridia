# Acid Lash (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (three drops of an acid-ic liquid)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You create a ten-foot long, vividly-purple, glowing line of magical force, which you can use as a whip. You use your spell attack modifier to attack. On a hit, it does 2d10 acid damage. If it does at least 15 points of damage, and if the target is wearing armor, the armorâ€™s AC is permanently reduced by one level of effectiveness. If it is reduced to AC 10, it is destroyed.
