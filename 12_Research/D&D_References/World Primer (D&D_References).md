# World Primer
*A Player's Guide to the Sundered Realms*

### Before the Great Convergence
Over twelve centuries ago, surface civilization and the sky realm of Aethermoor existed separately. Surface dwellers built great cities around harbors and rivers, developing crystal technology and parliamentary democracy. Meanwhile, the floating cities of Aethermoor drifted through the sky ocean, masters of wind magic and aerial navigation. Below both realms, ancient mer-folk civilizations thrived in the deepest trenches.

These three civilizations had limited contact—occasional trade expeditions, diplomatic missions, and rare inter-realm marriages. Each developed their own unique culture, magic, and understanding of reality.

### The Great Convergence
The dimensional merger that created modern Aquabyssos is well-documented in the surviving archives. What happened:
- Surface world and Aethermoor were pulled into oceanic dimensional space
- Reality merged creating breathable underwater environment  
- The Deep Mother's awakening triggered the convergence
- Survivors adapted through biological and magical transformation
- Three civilizations became one unified underwater realm

**Historical Facts**:
- **The Preparation**: Shadow entities had prepared surface civilization for decades
- **The Crystal Plague**: Enhanced many survivors' adaptation capabilities  
- **The Deep Fleet**: Military forces coordinated the final evacuation
- **The Transformation Wave**: Changed environmental physics to support life
- **The Integration**: Parliamentary democracy adapted to include all species

#### Geography by Depth

**The Sunlight Zone (0-500ft)**
The realm of politics and civilization. Here, filtered sunlight still reaches through the water, creating a twilight world of blues and greens. Coral cities rise like underwater mountains, their bioluminescent lights replacing the sun's warmth.

- **Abyssos Prime**: The capital, a massive city built into a underwater mountain
- **Port Cities**: Trading hubs where depth zones meet
- **Kelp Forests**: Agricultural zones feeding the empire
- **The Parliament Depths**: Where political power concentrates

**The Twilight Zone (500-1500ft)**
The working depths, where most citizens spend their lives. No natural light penetrates here—all illumination comes from bioluminescence, magical crystals, or technological innovations.

- **Industrial Sectors**: Pressure forges and processing plants
- **Military Installations**: Defense against deeper threats
- **Mining Operations**: Resource extraction from sea floor
- **Transit Hubs**: Pressure tube stations connecting zones

**The Midnight Zone (1500-4000ft)**
The frontier of civilization. Here, humanity has adapted beyond recognition. Settlements are sparse, danger is constant, and the pressure would kill an unprotected surface dweller in seconds.

- **Research Stations**: Studying depth phenomena
- **Prison Colonies**: For the worst criminals
- **Deep Temples**: Where the faithful commune with abyssal powers
- **Isolation Settlements**: For those who reject society

**The Abyssal Zone (4000ft+)**
Beyond human comprehension. Reality itself becomes fluid here. Time moves differently. Thoughts can become manifest. The Deep Mother whispers, and those who listen are forever changed.

- **The Dreaming Deeps**: Where consciousness merges
- **Leviathan Graveyards**: Where titans go to die
- **Reality Wounds**: Places where physics fails
- **The Deep Mother's Court**: If it exists at all

#### Society & Culture

**The Depth Caste System**
Society stratifies by how deep one can survive:
- **Surface Memory** (0-500ft): The elite who remember the sky
- **True Adapted** (0-1500ft): The middle class, fully aquatic
- **Deep Touched** (0-4000ft): Respected but feared
- **Abyss Speakers** (Unlimited): Prophets or madmen

**Daily Life**
- **Architecture**: Grown from coral, shaped by pressure
- **Food**: Kelp farms, fish herds, chemosynthetic gardens
- **Transportation**: Swimming, current-riding, pressure tubes
- **Communication**: Sonic devices, bioluminescent signals, water currents
- **Entertainment**: Memory theaters, current dancing, depth diving competitions

**Religion & Philosophy**
- **The Tidal Faith**: Worship of ocean cycles and pressures
- **Deep Mother Cults**: Believe in transformation through depth
- **The Ascending Path**: Seek return to surface paradise
- **The Synthesis**: Embrace permanent underwater evolution
- **Memory Keepers**: Preserve pre-Sundering knowledge

#### Geography

**Crystal Peaks**
Mountain ranges where crystallized magic forms naturally. These peaks glow with internal light, and those who mine them risk crystal corruption—a condition where the body slowly transforms into living crystal.

**The Floating Gardens**
Remts of pre-Sundering magic, these aerial botanical wonders drift slowly across the sky. Each garden is a self-contained ecosystem, some harboring species extinct elsewhere.

**Port Meridian**
The greatest surface city, built around the Lighthouse of Storms—one of the few remaining structures that remembers the world below. The city serves as the center of surface government and trade.

**The Void Shores**
Coastlines where the Surface Seal is visible—a shimmering barrier preventing access to the ocean. Sometimes, shadows of the world below can be glimpsed through the barrier.

#### Society & Culture

**Government**
A parliamentary monarchy where Queen Seraphina rules with a council of elected representatives. Power struggles between royalists, democrats, and various factions create constant political intrigue.

**Technology & Magic**
Without access to ocean resources, Aethermoor developed alternative technologies:
- **Crystal Resoce**: Harvesting power from mountain crystals
- **Wind Binding**: Capturing air currents for energy
- **Solar Collecting**: Storing sunlight in specialized containers
- **Memory Forging**: Creating items from crystallized memories

**Social Structure**
- **The Old Blood**: Families predating the Sundering

- Prophetic visions

#### The Parliament of Echoes
A massive underwater amphitheater where voices of the past literally echo through time. Debates from centuries ago can still be heard, and sometimes, they answer current questions.

#### The Inverted Palace
Built upside-down in a gravity anomaly, water flows up, and visitors walk on ceilings. The palace exists in multiple dimensions simultaneously.

#### The Memory Gardens
Where extracted memories are cultivated like living things. Visitors can walk through other people's experiences, but risk losing their own memories in exchange.

#### The Screaming Trees
A kelp forest that remembers pain. The plants emit psychic screams when disturbed, driving away predators and preserving ancient trauma.

#### The Lighthouse of Storms

## Conclusion: Your Place in the Story

As a player in this world, you stand at a crossroads of history. The decisions you make will determine whether:
- The worlds reunite, remain separated, or transform into something new
- Humanity evolves, maintains its nature, or fragments into multiple species
- Ancient powers are awakened, contained, or destroyed
- The truth of the Sundering is revealed, hidden, or rewritten

Every faction offers a different vision of the future. Every depth holds new mysteries. Every choice echoes through both worlds.

The pressure is building. The seal is weakening. The Deep Mother stirs.

What will you do when the tide turns?
