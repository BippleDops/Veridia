--- # Interrogation Techniques *"Truth flows like water - apply the right pressure and it will find its way out."* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Interrogation Techniques in the dual-realm world have evolved to account for the unique challenges of questioning suspects who may come from radically different cultural backgrounds, possess magical abilities, or have been affected by inter-dimensional phenomena. These methods combine traditional investigative approaches with specialized techniques for magical subjects and cross-cultural communication. ### Duration

Interrogation sessions typically last 1-4 hours with breaks for subject welfare. ## Adventure Hooks

1. **Interrogation Training**: Characters learn advanced questioning techniques
2. **Resistant Subject**: Interview someone with unusual magical or cultural protections
3. **False Information**: Determine truth when multiple suspects give conflicting stories ## Campaign Use


Provides framework for investigation scenes and adds realism to law enforcement encounters. ## Player-Facing Summary Interrogation Techniques is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Interrogation Techniques as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Interrogation Techniques. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Hidden Prophecy of Depths ## Plot Hooks - A document has gone missing and war looms
