# Campaign Legacy System

Multi-generational play: inherited transformations, faction reputation, ancestral memory, bloodline curses, temporal legacy.

## Inheritance
- Traits and scars pass with variance; can be purified or amplified

## Reputation
- Faction standings decay or ossify over generations

## Ancestral Memory
- Characters can access memory fragments of ancestors

## Bloodline Curses
- Pressure/corruption curses progress unless addressed

## Temporal Legacy
- Consequences echo forward/back through [[Complete_Temporal_Mechanics_System|Temporal Mechanics]]
