## New Player Orientation

### What Is Aquabyssos?
Aquabyssos is a vast underwater civilization born from tragedy. Nearly 900 years ago, a catastrophic event called the "Century of Storms" pulled three entire continents beneath the waves. Rather than perish, the survivors adapted through ancient magic - the **Drowning Embrace** - which transformed them into aquatic beings capable of life beneath the sea.

### Your Place in This World
As a player character in Aquabyssos, you might be:
- A **surface dweller** visiting or trapped in the depths
- A **transformed citizen** born in the underwater cities
- A **refugee** from recent disasters seeking a new home
- A **trader** conducting business between realms
- An **explorer** investigating the mysteries of the deep

### Essential Survival Knowledge
**Breathing:** If you're not naturally aquatic, you'll need magical assistance or special equipment to survive underwater. The **Depth Wardens** issue temporary breathing apparatus to visitors.

**Pressure:** The deeper you go, the more dangerous it becomes. Always check your depth tolerance and carry pressure-resistant gear.

**Light:** Beyond 500 fathoms (the Twilight Depth), sunlight disappears. Bioluminescent plants, magical lights, and native guidance become essential.

## The Drowned World: Geography and Settlements

### The Three Depths

#### The Twilight Depth (0-500 fathoms)
Where sunlight still filters through the water, creating an eternal twilight. Most visitors stay in this region.

**Key Locations:**
- **New Thalassopolis**: The grand capital built around the drowned surface city
- **Merchant's Current**: Floating markets following underwater trade routes
- **The Kelp Forests**: Vast underwater wilderness hiding ancient ruins

#### The Midnight Depth (500-2000 fathoms)
Absolute darkness broken only by magical and bioluminescent light sources.

**Key Locations:**
- **The Obsidian Palace**: Seat of government and royal court
- **Cities of Silence**: Settlements where sound is forbidden or dangerous
- **The Bone Trenches**: Vast underwater canyons and ancient battlefields

#### The Hadean Depth (2000+ fathoms)
The deepest reaches where reality itself becomes unstable. Only the most experienced guides dare travel here.
