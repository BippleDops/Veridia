## Description
A giant with a butterknife can at times be less deadly than a halfling with a razor. All smiths know the importance of a good grindstone. Our grindstone (20 gp) rests upon a weighted wheel, spun by a foot-pedal assembly to assure even sharpening. For sharpening blades while on the road, we also offer a small, flat whetstone (2 cp) for sharpening long blades and a stiff leather strop (2 cp) for sharpening daggers and knives.

## Additional Details
one grindstone is required to use the named proficiencies; any PC with an edged weapon must have (and assumedly use) a whetstone or strop (as suits) or suffer -1 to dmg per 6 months for dullness
