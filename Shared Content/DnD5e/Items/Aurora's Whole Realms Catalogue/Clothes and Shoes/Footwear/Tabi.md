## Description
Imported from Kara-Tur, these special shoes are like a two-toed sock. Think of them as fine, soft, cozy “mittens for feet.” Worn by eastern assassins, these shoes are quiet. We sell them only in black, but you may get wool (45 gp) or silk (100 gp). These are limited in supply, so order early.

## Additional Details
These shoes improve silence (+10%) to all Rogue characters who wear them, but are readily noticeable as the shoe of sneaky people, who often distrust the wearer
