**Environment**: Urban (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, or family (2–4 adults and 1–3 young)

[[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] nagas are aesthetes and artists that as a race have existed in the city for as long as anyone remembers. Whether they were indigenous inhabitants, early visitors from Between, or immigrants from a distant land is argued, but they have seemingly always been there. Most [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] nagas claim ancestry from the exotic lands of Far Jaati and go so far as to learn that land’s language, though this has yet to be proven and is refuted by some members of the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] naga community who, in fact, steadfastly deny this origin. The fact that members of the race can move among the humanoid populace indistinguishably in humanoid form further lends to this confusion.

[[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] nagas relish the arts, including the arcane arts. They have a propensity for identifying magical items, as well as the skill and capriciousness to fabricate such items (or fake versions of them to foist upon the unwary). Likewise, many a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] naga has coaxed or cajoled a fine piece of artwork or rare magical item out of the hands of its owner, augmenting their skills in such tasks with magic as necessary. When rolled together, this means [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] nagas are sought out for the keen ability to identify and appraise artwork and magical trinkets, yet held at arm’s length once the object is identified.

[[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] nagas are frailer than their more common cousins. However, they make up for this frailty, at least in part, with an odd evolutionary feature other types of nagas lack — arms. While the arms of a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] naga don’t have much in the way of musculature, they are well suited to fine craftwork and the ability to wield magical items such as wands and staves.

[[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] nagas delight in hiding in plain sight among the humanoids of the city, usually using their change shape ability to take the form of a humanoid female so as to mingle freely. Still, while using this ability they must be wary of the passage of time lest they find themselves transforming back to their natural state at an awkward moment.

A typical [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] naga is 12 feet long, resting on a coil of two-thirds of its body so that it stands only around 6 feet in height, and weighs 275 pounds on average.
