--- # Long Rest

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 370. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* A Long Rest is a period of extended downtime—at least 8 hours—available to any creature. During a Long Rest, you sleep for at least 6 hours and perform no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. During sleep, you have the [[conditions#Unconscious|Unconscious condition. After you finish a Long Rest, you must wait at least 16 hours before starting another one. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Benefits of the Rest To start a Long Rest, you must have at least 1 [hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]]. When you finish the rest, you gain the following benefits: - **Regain All HP.** You regain all lost [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules) and all spent [hit-point-dice-xphb (variant-rules)]]. If your Hit Point maximum was reduced, it returns to normal. - **Ability Scores Restored.** If any of your ability scores were reduced, they return to normal. - **Exhaustion Reduced.** If you have the [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion condition, its level decreases by 1. - **Special Feature.** Some features are recharged by a Long Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges in the way specified in its description. ## Interrupting the Rest A Long Rest is stopped by the following interruptions: - Rolling [Initiative Xphb]] - Casting a spell other than a cantrip - Taking any damage - 1 hour of walking or other physical exertion. If you rested at least 1 hour before the interruption you gain the benefits of a [[short-rest-xphb. You can resume a Long Rest immediately after an interruption. If you do so, the rest requires 1 additional hour per interruption to finish. [Dn D5e-Side Screen-2024]] ## Player-Facing Summary Long rest xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of long rest xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around long rest xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
