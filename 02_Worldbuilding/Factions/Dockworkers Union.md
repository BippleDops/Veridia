# Dockworkers Union

## General Info
**Location**: [[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/Locations/Shadowhaven]] Docks

## Description
The Dockworkers Union is a powerful and influential union that represents the interests of the dockworkers of Shadowhaven. They are a force to be reckoned with, and they are not afraid to use their power to get what they want.

## GM Notes
- The union is led by the tough and charismatic [[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/NPCs/Thresh "Ironhook" Valdris]].
- The union is a rival of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Factions/Merchants Guild.md]].
- The union is a potential ally for the party, but they will expect a hefty price for their services.
