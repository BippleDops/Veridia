## Description
This [[Magic Weapon|magic weapon]] has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15 [[Wisdom|Wisdom]] saving throw or become [[Frightened|frightened]] of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take [[12 - The Order of Combat|reactions]]. For its action, it can use only the [[14 - Actions in Combat|Dash]] action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The [[Mace|mace]] regains `dice: 1d3` (1d3) expended charges daily at dawn.
