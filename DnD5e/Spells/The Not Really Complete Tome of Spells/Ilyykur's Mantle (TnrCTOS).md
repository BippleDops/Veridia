# Ilyykur's Mantle (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (an uncut gemstone worth at least 25 gp)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
A luminous aura completely covers you and conforms the contours of your body. While this aura exists, you are resistant to being charmed or frightened, are resistant to lightning, and have advantage to all saving throws.

If you have a familiar, that familiar is also covered by the mantle as long as it stays in physical contact with you.
