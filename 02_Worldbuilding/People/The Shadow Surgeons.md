# The Shadow Surgeons

*"Where light fails to heal, shadow mends what should not be broken." - Chief Surgeon Mortis Voidcut*

## Overview
The Shadow Surgeons operate as an underground medical organization specializing in procedures deemed too dangerous, experimental, or ethically questionable for legitimate practitioners. Working from hidden clinics throughout Aquabyssos's darker districts, they offer services ranging from illegal enhancements to life-saving operations rejected by conventional medicine. Their motto "Any Life, Any Price" reflects their willingness to attempt procedures others won't consider.

Established by exiled medical professionals and self-taught practitioners, the organization fills a crucial niche for those who cannot access or afford traditional healing. However, their methods often involve dark magic, forbidden techniques, and morally ambiguous practices that blur the line between healing and harm.

## Methods and Philosophy

## Recent Activities
The organization has seen increased demand due to Crystal Plague cases rejected by conventional medicine. They've developed experimental treatments with mixed results, while expanding operations to handle the crisis. Several high-profile enhancement procedures have attracted attention from both clients and law enforcement.

**Spectacular Failures:** Experimental procedures resulting in worse conditions
**Cover-ups:** Attempts to hide failed operations from authorities
**Breakthrough Research:** Developments later adopted by legitimate medicine

## Adventure Hooks
1. Dying NPC requires Shadow Surgeon treatment to survive
2. Investigation into illegal organ trade leads to organization
3. Enhanced criminal with obvious surgical modifications causes problems
4. Former patient seeks revenge for botched procedure
5. Legitimate doctor requests help with impossible case
6. Underground facility discovered during unrelated investigation

## Roleplaying Notes
Shadow Surgeons are typically pragmatic and detached, focused on medical problems rather than moral implications. They speak in clinical terms even about disturbing procedures, viewing their work as necessary service rather than evil practice. Higher-ranking members may show genuine care for patients despite questionable methods.

## DM Notes
The Shadow Surgeons provide excellent opportunities for moral dilemmas and desperate solutions. They can offer critical healing when conventional methods fail, but at significant ethical and financial costs. Use them to explore themes of medical ethics, the price of survival, and the gray areas between helping and harming.
