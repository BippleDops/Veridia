# Quest - Smuggler's Run

*A dangerous cargo shipment threatens to destabilize the delicate political balance of [[Port Meridian]], and the characters must decide whether to expose the conspiracy or profit from it.*

## Quest Overview

**Level Range:** 3-7  
**Estimated Duration:** 4-6 sessions  
**Quest Type:** Investigation, Heist, Political Intrigue

The characters become entangled in a smuggling operation that goes far deeper than simple contraband.
