## Overview
A covert rescue operation where characters must extract a high-value prisoner from a heavily guarded facility without alerting the captors. The mission requires stealth, planning, and precise execution, as discovery would trigger diplomatic crisis or worse.

The target is a foreign diplomat's daughter held by extremists, and failure could lead to international war.

## Mission Parameters
**Target**: Lady Catherine Brighttide, daughter of surface world ambassador
**Location**: Abandoned mining facility converted to secret prison
**Captors**: Anti-surface extremist group with government sympathizers
**Time Limit**: 48 hours before public execution
**Stealth Requirement**: Rescue must appear to be prisoner escape, not outside intervention

## The Prisoner
**Name**: Lady Catherine Brighttide, age 22
**Background**: Diplomatic envoy studying underwater culture
**Capture Reason**: Symbol of surface world "corruption" to extremists
**Current Condition**: Physically unharmed but psychologically stressed
**Special Considerations**: Knows sensitive diplomatic information

## The Facility
**Location**: Former crystal mine 50 miles from Aquabyssos
**Structure**: Multi-level complex carved into underwater cliff
**Security**: 20+ guards, magical wards, trained sea creatures
**Layout**: Administrative level, prisoner cells, guard quarters, command center
**Defenses**: Alarm systems, reinforced blast doors, emergency lockdown procedures

## Security Details
**Guard Shifts**: Three rotating teams of 6-8 personnel each
**Patrol Schedule**: Predictable routes every 20 minutes
**Magical Security**: Ward stones detecting unauthorized magic use
**Communication**: Regular check-ins with outside command
**Emergency Protocol**: Immediate lockdown and prisoner elimination if discovered

## Mission Planning
**Intelligence Gathering**: Study facility layout, guard routines, security systems
**Equipment Preparation**: Non-lethal weapons, stealth gear, lock picks
**Entry Strategy**: Multiple options including underwater approach, maintece tunnels
**Extraction Route**: Planned escape path avoiding all security checkpoints
**Cover Story**: False evidence making rescue appear to be prisoner's plan

## Key NPCs
**Commander Reef Hardcurrent**: Facility security chief, professional soldier
**The Extremist Leader**: Fanatic driving the kidnapping plot
**Guard Captain Marina**: Sympathetic guard who might be turned
**Intelligence Contact**: Government agent providing inside information
**Prisoner's Father**: Ambassador driving diplomatic pressure for resolution

## Infiltration Options
**Underwater Approach**: Swimming through mining tunnels to facility foundation
**Supply Delivery**: Concealment in regular supply shipment
**Guard Impersonation**: Replacing guards during shift rotation
**Maintece Access**: Using forgotten service passages
**Prisoner Transfer**: Intercepting fake transfer to different location

## Equipment Needed
**Stealth Gear**: Dark clothing, sound dampening, movement enhancement
**Non-lethal Weapons**: Sleep darts, stunning magic, restraint devices
**Technical Tools**: Lock picks, ward disruptors, communication scramblers
**Emergency Supplies**: Medical kit, escape equipment, disguise materials
**Intelligence Devices**: Surveillance equipment, document copying tools

## Execution Phase
**Phase 1**: Infiltrate facility during guard shift change
**Phase 2**: Locate prisoner while avoiding detection
**Phase 3**: Extract prisoner and plant false evidence
**Phase 4**: Escape facility without triggering alarms
**Phase 5**: Deliver prisoner to safe location

## Failure Consequences
**Prisoner Death**: International incident, possible war declaration
**Discovery**: Characters become wanted criminals, diplomatic breakdown
**Guard Casualties**: Government disavows mission, characters abandoned
**Incomplete Extraction**: Prisoner remains captive, security increased
**Intelligence Compromise**: Future operations compromised

## Alternative Approaches

**Infiltration**: Long-term undercover placement to extract prisoner gradually
**Distraction**: Create external crisis to draw security away

## Adventure Hooks

2. Prisoner's family makes private appeal for help
3. Underground resistance seeks assistance with rescue operation

3. Important buildings/features
