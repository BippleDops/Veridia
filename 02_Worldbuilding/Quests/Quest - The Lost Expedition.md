# Quest - The Lost Expedition

**Level:** 7th-10th level characters  
**Sessions:** 4-6 sessions  
**Type:** Investigation/Exploration/Survival  

---

## Quest Summary

The renowned [[Windwright Academy]] sponsored expedition to the mysterious [[Shattered Isles]] has been missing for three months. Led by the famous explorer [[Captain Zara Stormwind]], the expedition was tasked with investigating strange magical phenomena and mapping the treacherous floating island chains of [[Aethermoor]]'s outer reaches. Now, desperate families and the Academy itself seek brave adventurers to discover the fate of the lost expedition and recover their valuable research.

The truth is far more complex: the expedition discovered an ancient [[Skyforge]] facility that's slowly corrupting the magical currents of [[Aethermoor]], turning the very air toxic to life. Some expedition members have been transformed by the corrupted magic, while others desperately seek a way to contain the growing threat.

## Act I: The Trail Grows Cold

### Opening Hook

The quest begins when the party is approached by one of the following:

- **[[Archmage Velina Duskweaver]]** of the [[Windwright Academy]], offering 1,000gp to learn the expedition's fate
- **[[Mira Stormwind]]**, Captain Zara's sister, begging for help finding her missing family member
- **[[Lord Commander Thane Skyward]]** of the [[Aethermoor Rangers]], who needs the expedition's research to prevent a larger catastrophe

### Initial Investigation (Sessions 1-2)

**Location:** [[Windwright Academy]], [[Port Nimbus]]

The party begins by investigating the expedition's last known activities:

#### Key Locations:
- **The Academy Archives:** Research notes reveal the expedition was investigating [[Void Storms]] and their connection to ancient ruins
- **The Dockmaster's Office:** Captain Zara chartered the airship [[Windwarden]] and loaded supplies for a month-long journey
- **The Broken Compass Tavern:** Expedition members spoke of discovering "something that shouldn't exist" in old maps

#### Important NPCs:

**[[Tobias Quillwright]]** - Academy Librarian
*Medium humanoid (human), lawful neutral*
- **Skills:** History +8, Investigation +6, Arcana +7
- **Service:** Provides expedition research notes and historical context about the [[Shattered Isles]]
- **Information:** Reveals the expedition was tracking an unusual pattern in [[Void Storm]] activity

**[[Captain Henrik Saltbreeze]]** - Harbor Master
*Medium humanoid (human), chaotic good*  
- **Skills:** Survival +6, Perception +7, Investigation +4
- **Service:** Offers airship charter services and navigation expertise
- **Information:** Reports that other ships have avoided the [[Shattered Isles]] due to "wrong winds" and strange lights

### Discovery: The Last Message

The party discovers a partially damaged [[Sending Stone]] that contains a fragmented message from Captain Zara:

*"...found it...the source...corruption spreading...some of the crew are chang...don't trust...sky itself turns against..."*

**Clues Point To:** The [[Shattered Isles]], specifically a cluster called the [[Crying Peaks]] where several [[Windwright Academy]] expeditions have vanished over the past decade.

## Act II: Into the Shattered Skies

### Journey to the Shattered Isles (Session 2-3)

**Challenges:**
- Navigating [[Void Storms]] (DC 15 Survival checks)
- Airship maintenance during magical weather (DC 12 Arcana/Investigation)
- Encounters with corrupted sky creatures (see NPC stats below)

#### Key Encounters:

**Corrupted Wind Elemental**
*Large elemental, chaotic evil*
**AC** 15, **HP** 90, **Speed** 0 ft., fly 90 ft.  
**Attacks:** Slam +8 (2d8+4 bludgeoning + 1d6 necrotic)
**Special:** Void Winds - creatures within 10 feet must make DC 14 Constitution saves or take 1d4 necrotic damage and be pushed 15 feet

### The Windwarden's Wreck

**Location:** Crashed on a small floating island in the [[Crying Peaks]]

The party finds the expedition's airship, crashed but largely intact. Investigation reveals:

- Most of the crew evacuated safely with emergency supplies
- The ship's [[Aethermoor Navigation Crystal]] has been corrupted, turning from blue to sickly purple
- Personal logs indicate the crew was divided about whether to continue or retreat
- Tracks lead deeper into the island cluster

**AC** 12, **HP** 27, **Speed** 25 ft.

**Background:** The expedition's cook, driven half-mad by three months alone with corrupted magic affecting his mind.

**Roleplay:** Jenkin is paranoid and terrified, initially hiding from the party. He believes everyone else has been "changed by the purple air" and refuses to trust anyone until they prove they haven't been corrupted.

**Information:** 
- Captain Zara led most of the expedition to investigate a "great machine" on the central island
- Several crew members began changing, growing crystalline growths and speaking in unison
- The corruption gets worse the closer one gets to the central island

## Act III: The Skyforge Revealed

### The Central Mystery (Sessions 3-4)

**Location:** [[Ancient Skyforge Complex]] on the largest island of the [[Crying Peaks]]

The expedition discovered a massive [[Skyforge]] facilityâ€”a relic from the [[Age of Skybound Empires]]. The facility was designed to purify and redirect [[Aethermoor]]'s magical currents, but centuries of neglect have reversed its function, corrupting instead of cleansing.

#### Key Areas:

**The Corruption Chambers:** Where expedition members are being slowly transformed into [[Void-touched]] beings

**The Central Forge:** A massive machine drawing power from [[Aethermoor]]'s ley lines and spreading corruption

**The Crystal Gardens:** Twisted formations of corrupted [[Aetherite]] that pulse with malevolent energy
