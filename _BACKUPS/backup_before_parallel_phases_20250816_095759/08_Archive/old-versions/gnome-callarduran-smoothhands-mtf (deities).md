*Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 111* - **Alignment**: Neutral
- **Domains**: Knowledge, Nature
- **Pantheon**: Gnome
- **Province**: Mining, stone carving
- **Symbol**: Golden signet ring with six pointed star Callarduran became the patron of the deep gnomes when he led them into the Underdark and taught them how to survive, but all gnomes see him as the embodiment of the drive to know more, to examine everything more minutely-and thereby make great discoveries. Callarduran earned his moniker when, after stealing the heart of OgrÃ©moch, he rubbed his hands smooth as he polished the heart and turned it into a magical stone. The theft caused OgrÃ©moch to turn to evil, but it gave Callarduran the power to control earth elementals-which, it is said, he can confer to deep gnomes by rubbing the stone and saying their names. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Gnome callarduran smoothhands mtf is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
