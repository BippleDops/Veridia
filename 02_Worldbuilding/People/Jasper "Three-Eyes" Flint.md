# Jasper "Three-Eyes" Flint
*The Broker of Whispers, He Who Sees All Angles, King of the Pressure Rats*

## Overview
Jasper "Three-Eyes" Flint is the most notorious information broker in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], operating from the shadowy depths where official law holds little sway. Born on the surface but transformed during the great submersion, his most distinctive feature is the third eye that opened in his forehead - a mutation that grants him supernatural perception. He trades in secrets, contraband, and favors, maintaining an intricate network of contacts throughout both the depths and surface world.

## Appearance
- **Build**: Wiry, 5'6", moves with predatory grace
- **Age**: Appears 45, actually unknown (depth transformation complicates aging)
- **Distinguishing Features**:
  - **Third Eye**: Centered on forehead, glows pale blue, never blinks
  - **Scarred Hands**: From handling dangerous depth artifacts
  - **Modified Gills**: Crude surgical additions that sometimes leak brine
  - **Pressure Tattoos**: Ink that shifts color based on depth/pressure
- **Clothing**: Practical diving gear modified with hidden pockets and signal devices

## Personality
- **Surface Demeanor**: Affable, quick-witted, always making deals
- **True Nature**: Paranoid survivor with genuine loyalty to his crew
- **Core Traits**: Opportunistic, pragmatic, surprisingly honorable in his way
