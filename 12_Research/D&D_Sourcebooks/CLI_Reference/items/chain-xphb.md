# Chain
*Adventuring gear*  

- **Cost**: 5 gp
- **Weight**: 10.0 lbs.

As a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action, you can wrap a Chain around an unwilling creature within 5 feet of yourself that has the [[conditions#Grappled|Grappled]], [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]], or [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition if you succeed on a DC 13 Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check. If the creature's legs are bound, the creature has the [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition until it escapes. Escaping the Chain requires the creature to make a successful DC 18 Dexterity ([[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]) check as an action. Bursting the Chain requires a successful DC 20 Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check as an action.
