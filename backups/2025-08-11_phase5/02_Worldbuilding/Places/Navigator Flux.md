# Navigator Flux

**Type:** Temporal Navigator/Reality Guide  
**Location:** [[The Neutral Current Tavern]] - [[Abyssos Prime]]  
**World:** [[Aquabyssos]]  
**Occupation:** Navigator of Time Streams and Reality Currents  
**Race:** Unknown (appears to shift between forms)  
**Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral

*"Time flows like water, friend. Sometimes upstream, sometimes down. The trick is knowing which way the current really goes."*

## Overview
Navigator Flux is one of the most enigmatic figures in [[Abyssos Prime]], a being whose very existence seems to challenge the normal flow of time and causality. Known throughout the underwater city as the only navigator capable of guiding vessels through the treacherous temporal anomalies that surround certain deep-sea routes, Flux operates from [[The Neutral Current Tavern]] where they hold court with sailors, merchants, and adventurers seeking passage through reality's more unstable waters.

Flux's services are legendary among those who need to travel through areas where time itself becomes unreliable - regions where a journey of days might take minutes, or where travelers arrive at their destination before they departed. Their unique abilities make them invaluable to traders working the most profitable but dangerous routes, though their unpredictable nature and mysterious background make every interaction a calculated risk.

## Physical Appearance and Characteristics
Flux's appearance seems to exist in a constant state of subtle change, never quite the same from one meeting to the next. They typically appear as a tall, lean figure draped in flowing robes that shift color like deep ocean currents, moving through shades of blue, green, and occasionally silver or gold. Their face carries features that seem to blend characteristics from multiple races - sometimes more elven, sometimes human, occasionally showing traces of something far more exotic.

Most striking are Flux's eyes, which appear to contain swirling galaxies of stars and seem to reflect not the present moment but glimpses of potential futures and forgotten pasts. When they speak, their voice carries subtle echoes, as if multiple versions of themselves from different timelines were speaking in slight unison.

Flux carries a staff carved from what appears to be crystallized time itself - a translucent material that occasionally shows glimpses of scenes from different temporal periods. Maps and navigation instruments float around them without visible support, constantly updating to show not just current conditions but probable future states of wind, current, and reality.

## Background and Origins

### The Temporal Incident
Flux's origins are shrouded in conflicting stories, many of which they seem to encourage rather than clarify. The most commonly accepted version suggests they were once a conventional navigator who became caught in a massive temporal anomaly during the early years after the Great Drowning. Instead of being destroyed or lost, they somehow merged with the anomaly itself, gaining unprecedented understanding of how time and space interact in the post-Drowning world.

### Early Manifestations
The first reliable accounts of Flux appeared roughly fifty years ago, when several impossible navigation feats brought them to public attention. Ships guided by Flux began arriving at destinations days before they should have, or returning from journeys that should have taken weeks in mere hours. More remarkably, some vessels guided by Flux were reported arriving at ports with cargo that wouldn't exist for years, or carrying messages from their own future selves.

### Building a Reputation
As word of Flux's abilities spread, they became increasingly sought after by merchants seeking competitive advantages and explorers attempting to reach previously inaccessible locations. However, Flux's services came with strict conditions and unpredictable results - success was almost guaranteed, but the form that success took was rarely what clients expected.

### Establishing Operations
Flux eventually settled into a routine of operating from [[The Neutral Current Tavern]], where their presence seems to create a pocket of temporal stability that allows for reliable communication and planning. The tavern has become an unofficial hub for the most adventurous and desperate navigators, traders, and explorers in [[Aquabyssos]].

## Abilities and Services

### Temporal Navigation
**Time Current Reading**: Flux can perceive the flow of time itself as a navigable medium, identifying areas where it moves faster, slower, or in different directions entirely.

**Temporal Route Planning**: Creating travel plans that take advantage of time distortions to achieve impossible journey times or reach destinations that exist only briefly.

**Reality Anchor Services**: Providing stability for vessels traveling through areas where the nature of reality itself becomes uncertain.

**Paradox Resolution**: Helping clients deal with the consequences of temporal travel, including encounters with alternate versions of themselves or knowledge of events that haven't occurred yet.

### Navigation Expertise
**Impossible Routes**: Guiding vessels through paths that exist only under specific temporal conditions or in alternate reality states.

**Current Prediction**: Forecasting not just weather and water conditions but changes in the fundamental nature of space and time in specific regions.

**Emergency Extraction**: Rescuing travelers who have become lost in temporal anomalies or trapped in recursive time loops.

**Destination Flexibility**: Helping clients reach not just physical locations but specific points in time or alternate versions of familiar places.

### Information Services
**Future Knowledge**: Providing glimpses of potential outcomes for various courses of action, though the accuracy depends on numerous variables.

**Historical Consultation**: Access to information from different time periods, including events that may have been erased from normal historical records.

**Probability Assessment**: Calculating the likelihood of various outcomes when dealing with time-sensitive or reality-affecting decisions.

**Timeline Mapping**: Creating charts that show not just geographical features but temporal hazards and opportunities.

## The Neutral Current Tavern Operations

### Flux's Corner
Within [[The Neutral Current Tavern]], Flux maintains a semi-permanent corner table that serves as their unofficial office. The area around this table exists in a pocket of temporal stability, allowing for extended conversations and planning sessions without the risk of time distortion affecting the meeting.

The table itself appears to be made from the same crystallized time material as Flux's staff, and its surface shows constantly shifting maps and charts that update in real-time to reflect changing temporal conditions throughout [[Aquabyssos]] and beyond. Floating around the table are various navigation instruments, including compasses that point to "temporal north" and hourglasses that measure the flow of time in different locations.

### Client Consultations
Flux accepts clients during specific hours that seem to shift based on temporal conditions rather than conventional timekeeping. These consultation sessions can last anywhere from minutes to hours, depending on the complexity of the navigation challenge and the temporal resources required to solve it.

During these meetings, Flux assesses not just the physical destination the client wants to reach, but their motivations, the consequences of success or failure, and the temporal implications of various possible routes. This comprehensive analysis allows them to provide navigation services that take into account not just getting somewhere, but ensuring that arrival serves the client's true interests.

### The Navigator's Network
Flux maintains relationships with other navigators, sailors, and time-sensitive individuals throughout [[Aquabyssos]]. This network provides both information about changing conditions and opportunities for collaboration on particularly challenging navigation projects.

Members of this network often gather at [[The Neutral Current Tavern]] to share information, coordinate efforts, and seek Flux's guidance on temporal navigation challenges. These informal gatherings have become an important source of intelligence about conditions in the more dangerous and mysterious parts of the underwater realm.

## Pricing and Payment Methods

### Standard Navigation Services
Flux's pricing for navigation services reflects both their unique abilities and their unpredictable nature. Rather than accepting simple monetary payment, they typically require something that has temporal significance - an item from the client's past, a promise about future behavior, or the resolution of a paradox that has personal meaning.

**Short-Range Temporal Adjustments**: 500-2,000 gold pieces equivalent, plus a personal memento from the client's childhood.

**Major Route Navigation**: 5,000-20,000 gold pieces equivalent, plus completion of a task that will have significance in the client's future.

**Reality-Bending Journeys**: Negotiated individually, often requiring the client to accept responsibility for temporal consequences they cannot yet understand.

**Emergency Extraction**: Variable pricing, but typically involves the client owing Flux a future favor to be specified at a later time.

### Alternative Payment Structures
**Information Exchange**: Flux sometimes accepts payment in the form of information about temporal anomalies, unusual events, or knowledge from other time periods.

**Service Trading**: Occasional arrangements where clients provide services to other members of Flux's network in exchange for navigation assistance.

**Temporal Arbitrage**: Complex arrangements where clients help Flux resolve temporal paradoxes or stabilize time streams in exchange for navigation services.

**Future Considerations**: Agreements where payment is delayed until the client reaches a specific point in their personal timeline.

### Special Conditions
All of Flux's services come with specific warnings and conditions:
- **Temporal Side Effects**: Navigation through time-distorted areas may result in aging at different rates, encountering alternate versions of oneself, or gaining unwanted knowledge of future events.
- **Reality Anchoring**: Clients must accept that successful navigation might result in arriving at a destination that is subtly different from the one they expected.
- **Paradox Responsibility**: Travelers take full responsibility for any temporal paradoxes they create or encounter during their journey.
- **Non-Disclosure**: Clients agree not to share specific details about temporal routes with unauthorized individuals.

## Political and Social Relationships

### Government Interactions
Flux maintains a carefully neutral relationship with [[Parliament of Echoes]] and other governmental authorities in [[Aquabyssos]]. While officials recognize the value of their unique abilities, they also understand that Flux's temporal nature makes them largely immune to conventional forms of control or regulation.

**Official Contracts**: Occasional arrangements where Flux provides navigation services for government expeditions to temporally unstable areas.

**Intelligence Cooperation**: Limited sharing of information about temporal threats or opportunities that could affect [[Aquabyssos]] security.

**Regulatory Exemptions**: Understanding that normal laws and regulations cannot meaningfully apply to someone who exists partially outside conventional time.

> [!warning] DM Secret
> Flux is actually the future version of one of the player characters, who gained temporal abilities after a catastrophic event that destroyed their original timeline. They have traveled back to guide events in a way that might prevent that catastrophe, but their very presence creates the conditions that could cause it. Every service they provide, every piece of advice they give, brings the timeline closer to the moment when one of the party members must choose between saving their world and maintaining their own existence. Flux knows this, but cannot reveal the truth without guaranteeing the catastrophic outcome they're trying to prevent.
