# The Screaming Gardens
## Where Every Tree Was Once a Drowning Child

> *"They planted screams and grew a forest. Now the forest sings warnings no one heeds."*
> — The Conductor

## Overview

The Screaming Gardens sprawl across three square miles of Abyssos Prime's eastern district, a crystallized forest where every tree was formed from the death screams of drowning victims. When the current flows through the crystal branches, they resonate with the final moments of those who died, creating an endless symphony of warning and anguish.

## History

### The Great Drowning
During the Cataclysm of Tides, thousands of children were at the Meridian Youth Academy when the waters rose. Their screams crystallized in the magical catastrophe, growing into the first trees. Over centuries, more screaming trees have been "planted" as executions, murders, and suicides add to the grove.

### The Conductor's Arrival
Fifty years ago, a musician named Orpheus Deepnote went mad trying to compose a symphony from the screams. He transformed himself into living sound, becoming [[The Conductor]], and now orchestrates the gardens' cacophony into prophetic warnings.

## Geography

### Districts

#### The Songwood Grove
**Description**: The oldest section, where the original academy children became trees
**Tree Types**: Primarily blue-crystal from drowning
**Sounds**: Children calling for parents, school songs turned to dirges
**Danger**: Memory parasites feed on visitors' childhood trauma

#### The Execution Clearing
**Description**: Where the Parliament conducts public crystallization executions
**Tree Types**: Purple-crystal from magical execution
**Sounds**: Last words, curses, declarations of innocence
**Danger**: Trees actively try to grab and crystallize visitors

#### The Suicide Spiral
**Description**: A spiral path where the desperate come to join the garden
**Tree Types**: Grey-crystal from voluntary transformation
**Sounds**: Whispers of despair, promises of peace
**Danger**: Compulsion effects, WIS save DC 16 or walk toward center

#### The Prophet's Podium
**Description**: Central platform where The Conductor performs
**Tree Types**: Mixed, arranged by tonal quality
**Sounds**: Organized into actual prophecies and warnings
**Danger**: The Conductor's experiments with visitors' screams

## Notable Features

### The Mother Tree
The largest tree, formed from a pregnant woman who drowned trying to save her children. Sometimes, on quiet nights, you can hear a lullaby that causes uncontrollable weeping.

### The Harmony Hollow
A depression where screams cancel each other out, creating perfect silence. The only quiet place in the gardens, but the silence is so complete it causes madness.

### The Echo Chamber
A crystalline amphitheater where screams bounce eternally, growing louder with each reflection. Entering means hearing every scream that ever was and ever will be.

## Inhabitants

### The Conductor
- **Role**: Self-appointed orchestrator of screams
- **Abilities**: Can weaponize screams, predict future through scream patterns
- **Motivation**: Compose the perfect symphony of suffering
- **Secret**: Is actually three children fused together during transformation

### Scream Thieves
- **Description**: Creatures that steal voices to add to the garden
- **Method**: Silent until they strike, then victim can only scream
- **Purpose**: Expanding the garden's collection

### The Mute Gardeners
- **Description**: Volunteers who gave up their voices to tend the gardens
- **Appearance**: Wrapped in sound-dampening cloth
- **Communication**: Elaborate sign language
- **Knowledge**: Which trees hold important warnings

### Memory Parasites
- **Description**: Psychic entities that feed on traumatic memories
- **Appearance**: Invisible until fed, then take the form of the trauma
- **Effect**: Drain memories but leave the emotional scars
- **Reproduction**: Split when fully fed

## Plot Hooks

### The Missing Verse
The Conductor claims the gardens' symphony is missing one crucial scream - a specific person who needs to die to complete the prophecy. They're willing to pay anything to arrange this death.

### The Silent Child
A living child wanders the gardens, completely mute, unaffected by the screams. The trees seem to bow away from them. No one knows who they are or why they're there.

### The Backwards Tree
One tree screams in reverse, speaking of events that haven't happened yet. Its prophecies are always accurate but understanding them requires surviving prolonged exposure.

### The Garden's Growth
The gardens are expanding faster than new deaths can account for. Trees are appearing that contain screams from people who are still alive, suggesting timeline contamination.

### To Other Districts
- **Parliament of Echoes**: Executions performed here end in the gardens
- **Memory Meadows**: Memory parasites migrate between locations
- **Reflection Pools**: Sometimes reflect the gardens' victims before transformation

## DM Notes

### Atmosphere
- Constant sound - never complete silence except in Harmony Hollow
- Crystal trees tinkle like wind chimes between screams
- Light refracts through crystal creating rainbow patterns over horror
- Smell of salt and terror-sweat

### Roleplay Tips
- The Conductor speaks in musical terms only
- Mute Gardeners use exaggerated gestures
- Trees "recognize" people who remind them of their lives
- Children's trees are the most active and aggressive

### Horror Elements
- Parents might recognize their children's screams
- Trees made from people the party failed to save
- Gradual realization that some screams are prophecies
- The compulsion to add your own scream to the symphony

> *"Every scream tells a story. Every story ends the same. But oh, what music they make together!"*
> — The Conductor
