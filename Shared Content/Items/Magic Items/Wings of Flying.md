## Description
While wearing this cloak, you can use an action to speak its command word. This turns the cloak into a pair of [[Bat|bat]] wings or bird wings on your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action. The wings give you a [[13 - Movement and Position|flying]] speed of 60 feet. When they disappear, you canâ€™t use them again for `dice: 1d12`(1d12) hours.
