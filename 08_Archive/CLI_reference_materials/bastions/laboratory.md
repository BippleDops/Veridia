# Laboratory
*Level 9 Bastion facility*  

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Space**: Roomy (16 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 1
- **Order**: craft

A Laboratory contains storage space for alchemical supplies and workspaces for crafting various concoctions.

## Craft Options

When you issue the "Craft" order to this facility, choose one of the following options:

- **Craft.** Alchemist's Supplies. The facility's hireling crafts anything that can be made with [Alchemist's Supplies](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/alchemists-supplies-xphb.md) using the rules in the "Player's Handbook" and "chapter 7" of this book.  
- **Craft.** Poison. You commission the facility's hireling to craft a vial containing one application of a poison. The poison must be one of the following: [Burnt Othur Fumes](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/burnt-othur-fumes-xdmg.md), [Essence of Ether](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/essence-of-ether-xdmg.md), or [Torpor](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/torpor-xdmg.md). This work takes 7 days, and you must pay half the poison's cost. See ""Poison"" in "chapter 3" for descriptions and costs of poisons.

## Player-Facing Summary

Laboratory is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of laboratory as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around laboratory.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties laboratory to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at laboratory to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to laboratory active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
