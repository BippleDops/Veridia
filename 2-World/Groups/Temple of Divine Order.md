# Temple of Divine Order

## General Info
**Location**: Shadowhaven

## Description
The Temple of Divine Order is a powerful and influential religious organization that is dedicated to upholding the law and punishing the wicked. They are led by the charismatic and zealous High Priestess Seraphina Lightbringer, and they are a force to be reckoned with.

## GM Notes
- The temple is a potential ally for the party, but they are also very rigid and uncompromising in their beliefs.
- The temple is a rival of the [[2-World/Groups/Thieves Guild.md]] and the [[2-World/Groups/The Shadowhaven Smugglers Ring.md]].
- The temple has a secret army of holy warriors who are ready to be called upon at a moment's notice.
