# Spinning Saw Blade
## Overview
*Mechanical trap*
Hidden behind a wall, this circular saw blade with a 5-foot-radius runs along a track in the wall, floor, or ceiling after a tripwire is activated.

The tripwire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the tripwire or the blades hidden deep within a slot in the walls. A DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check notices the deep grooves in the wall, ceiling, or floor that serve as the saw's track. A DC 15 Dexterity check made with thieves' tools breaks the tripwire harmlessly. A character without thieves' toolscan attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or tool. On a failed check the trap triggers.

Once the trap is activated the saw moves 40 feet along its track at the start of a round. The saw makes an attack roll with a +6 bonus against any creature in its path. On a hit the creature takes 11 (2d10) slashing damage. If the saw gets to the end of its track, it switches direction and comes back the other way.

Some tripwires are triggered to activate multiple saws in a room or hall, each of which runs along a different track and gets to make its own attacks at the start of the round.
