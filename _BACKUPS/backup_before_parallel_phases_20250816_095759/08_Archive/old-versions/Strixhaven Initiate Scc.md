--- # Strixhaven Initiate

*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 36* You have studied some magical theory and have learned a few spells associated with Strixhaven University. Choose one of Strixhaven's colleges: Lorehold, Prismari, Quandrix, Silverquill, or Witherbloom. You learn two cantrips and one 1st-level spell based on the college you choose, as specified in the Strixhaven Spells table. You can cast the chosen 1st-level spell without a spell slot, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have. Your spellcasting ability for this feat's spells is Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (choose when you select this feat). **Strixhaven Spells** | College | Cantrips | 1st-Level Spell |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Lorehold | Choose two from [[Fount of Moonlight Xphb, [sacred-flame-xphb (spells)]], and [[Thaumaturgy Xphb. | Choose one 1st-level cleric or wizard spell. |
| Prismari | Choose two from [fire-bolt-xphb (spells)]], [[Prestidigitation Xphb, and [ray-of-frost-xphb (spells)]]. | Choose one 1st-level bard or sorcerer spell. |
| Quandrix | Choose two from [[druidcraft-xphb (spells), [guidance-xphb (spells)]], and [[mage-hand-xphb (spells). | Choose one 1st-level druid or wizard spell. |
| Silverquill | Choose two from [sacred-flame-xphb (spells)]], [[Thaumaturgy Xphb, and [Vicious Mockery Xphb]]. | Choose one 1st-level bard or cleric spell. |
