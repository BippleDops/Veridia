  "revised_prompt": "Create a concept art in a consistent painterly style while adhering the rules of the tabletop fantasy world. Show a muscular creature with unique limbs, possibly resembling an allip-mpmm, standing next to a human silhouette for comparison. This scene should be set in a zone that merges the beauty of sky and the depths of sea, highlighting the motion of the both characters and the surrounding elements. Maintain a sense of aquatic fantasy realism by incorporating bioluminescent accents and reflecting the light patterns created by subsurface water caustics. Culture-specific gear should be included, that complements the medieval fantasy theme without any influence from modern technology. Utilize a three-color palette focusing on aquatic hues like teals, deep blues, sea-greens, and add pearl-like highlights to enhance the mystical appeal. The materials to depict this scene should give an impression of being under a pressure-dome. Avoid any visual artifacts, unnecessary text, random letters or symbols. Also, refrain from using sci-fi UIs, modern signage, photoreal CGI, and anime style, keeping the overall artwork a blend of realism and fantasy.",
