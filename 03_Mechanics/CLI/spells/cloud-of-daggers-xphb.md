# Cloud of Daggers
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sliver of glass)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure spinning daggers in a 5-foot [Cube](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on a point within range. Each creature in that area takes `4d4` Slashing damage. A creature also takes this damage if it enters the [Cube](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) or ends its turn there or if the [Cube](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) moves into its space. A creature takes this damage only once per turn.

On your later turns, you can take a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to teleport the [Cube](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) up to 30 feet.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `2d4` for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes**: [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Warlock](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Sorcerer](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard (College of Lore)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
