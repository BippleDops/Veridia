--- #### Core Sensory Profile

**Summary**: Core Sensory Profile - Key information at a glance.

**Visual**: Bioluminescent spectrum dominates—blues, greens, and cold purples replacing natural sunlight. Coral veins pulse through architecture like living circulatory systems. Temporal layers create double-vision effects where multiple time periods overlap visually. **Audio**: Water-muffled omnidirectional sound where conversations seem to come from everywhere and nowhere. Constant pressure groans from architecture, structural adjustments to depth, and the distant musical warnings from Screaming Gardens. **Olfactory**: Ancient brine base-note mixed with organic sweetness of coral growth, metallic undertones from dissolved coins/metals, and sharp ozone from concentrated magic. Memory-moss spores carry phantom scents from the surface past. **Tactile**: Crushing pressure as constant background sensation—psychological weight as much as physical. Temperature varies between memory-warm pockets and shadow-cold zones. Current flows require constant balance correction. **Taste/Air Quality**: Metallic tang from magical saturation, concentrated salt that coats throat, bitter temporal magic aftertaste, pearl-dust sensation in lungs from modified atmosphere. **Proprioceptive**: Gravity feels negotiable, navigation becomes intuitive rather than rational, phantom limb sensations from temporal echoes of other selves, pressure creates sensation of being held/supported/trapped simultaneously. #### District Variations **Abyssos Prime - The Inverse Palace**

**Summary**: District Variations **Abyssos Prime - The Inverse Palace** - Key information at a glance.

- Upward-flowing water creates reverse-waterfall ambiance
- Temperature shifts between chambers based on Emperor's personality fragments

- Sound arrives before visual confirmation due to temporal echoes **Parliament of Echoes**
- Cacophonous political debate from multiple time periods
- Faction-specific scent signatures (brine/coral/sunshine/pressure/emptiness)
- Voting crystals temperature-respond to senator authenticity
- Air thick with unresolved tension and ancient anger **The Screaming Gardens**
- Crystallized trauma transformed into ethereal warning melodies
- Memory-moss contact triggers overwhelming sensory flashbacks

- Moderate pressure effects: tight clothing sensation progressing to closing fist
- Ear-popping frequency: every few minutes
- Breathing effort: noticeable but manageable with concentration
- Adaptation sensations: gills developing (neck itching), lung modifications (chest tingling) **3,000-5,000 feet (Deep Districts)**
- Severe pressure effects: constant crushing sensation, movement restriction
- Ear-popping: nearly continuous, sometimes painful
- Breathing effort: each breath requires focused effort
- Advanced adaptation: bone density changes (deep aches), enhanced pressure tolerance **5,000+ feet (The Abyssal Depths)**
- Extreme pressure: sensation of being trapped in solid matter
- Hearing changes: inner ear modifications alter sound perception
- Breathing transformation: complete shift to water-breathing
- Final adaptation: complete physiological transformation to depth-dweller #### Temporal Sensory Phenomena **Frozen Moments**: Absolute sensory silence except for thought, temperature neutrality, tearing sensation when resuming normal time flow. **Future Bleeds**: Phantom sensations of unrealized events, déjà vu layering, temporal vertigo from experiencing multiple timeline possibilities. **Past Echoes**: Full sensory participation in historical events, trauma overlap from drowning victims, identity confusion from experiencing others' memories. **Timeline Overlap**: Simultaneous contradictory sensations (air/water breathing, sun/pressure, ancient/modern sounds), reality uncertainty, spatial navigation difficulties. #### Shadow Presence Indicators **Temperature**: Localized cold spots that move independently of light sources, ice formation in water around shadow concentrations, thermal contrast creating visible breath in shadow zones. **Auditory**: Whispered conversations in almost-understandable languages, rustling sounds from formless entities, echoed footsteps that don't match personal rhythm. **Tactile**: Invisible hands touching/tugging sensations, feeling of constant observation, pressure changes from shadow proximity, electric tingling when shadows interact. **Visual**: Shadows moving before/after their casters, reaching toward interesting objects, recoiling from threats, having different shapes than originating objects. **Emotional**: Identity uncertainty from shadow-thoughts intruding, paranoia about replacement, sensing hostility/affection from shadow-presences, gradual personality changes. --- #### Core Sensory Profile

**Summary**: Core Sensory Profile - Key information at a glance.

**Visual**: Crystal-enhanced light creating prismatic effects everywhere. Magical machinery produces visible energy flows. Architectural impossibilities supported by crystal technology. Vast sky views with floating platforms and crystal bridges. **Audio**: Crystal resoce harmonics underlying all sound, wind patterns channeled through architectural design, magical machinery humming, coordinated crystal formations creating symphonic ambiance. **Olfactory**: Clean, high-altitude air with crystal ozone, minimal organic scents except in gardens, metallic notes from extensive crystal machinery, artificially pure atmosphere. **Tactile**: Reduced gravity sensation from crystal field effects, comfortable temperatures maintained by climate crystal systems, vibrations from magical machinery felt through floors/walls. **Taste/Air Quality**: Pure, energizing air that enhances physical performance, crystal-dust sensation that's pleasant rather than irritating, magical enhancement making breath feel substantial and nourishing. **Proprioceptive**: Enhanced grace and coordination from magical field effects, improved balance for high-altitude navigation, spatial awareness augmented by crystal network feedback. #### District Variations **Crystal Gardens - The Prismatic Heart**

1. **Layered Description**: Start with one primary sense, then add others gradually
2. **Cultural Consistency**: Maintain regional sensory signatures for world-building immersion
3. **Character Relevance**: Tailor descriptions to character backgrounds and sensitivities
4. **Emotional Integration**: Use sensory details to support narrative mood and player engagement #### For Players

1. **Sensory Vocabulary**: Develop character-specific ways of describing environmental experience
2. **Adaptation Roleplay**: Show how characters adjust to different regional sensory environments
3. **Memory Anchors**: Use sensory details to create memorable location-character associations
4. **Investigation Clues**: Pay attention to sensory inconsistencies that might indicate hidden information #### For World Consistency

1. **Regional Authenticity**: Each area should have distinctive sensory signature that remains consistent
2. **Transition Logic**: Boundary zones should show gradual sensory shifts rather than abrupt changes
3. **Cultural Integration**: Different peoples should have developed cultural responses to their environmental sensory conditions
4. **Mechanical Integration**: Sensory descriptions should support rather than contradict game mechanical systems ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Sensory Signature Guides is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
