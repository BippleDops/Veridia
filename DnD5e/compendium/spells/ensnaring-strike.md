# Ensnaring Strike
*1st-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 bonus
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, a writhing mass of thorny vines appears at the point of impact, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the magical vines until the spell ends. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw. If the target succeeds on the save, the vines shrivel away.

While [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by this spell, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the vines or one that can touch the creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is freed.

**Classes**: Paladin (Ancients), Ranger
