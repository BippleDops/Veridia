# Dust of Sneezing and Choking
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/dust-of-sneezing-and-choking.webp#right)


Found in a small container, this powder resembles [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/dust-of-disappearance-xdmg|Dust of Disappearance]], and [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/identify-xphb|Identify]] reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.

As a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action, you can throw the dust into the air, forcing yourself and every creature in a 30-foot [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] originating from you to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Constructs, Elementals, Oozes, Plants, and Undead succeed on the save automatically.

On a failed save, a creature begins sneezing uncontrollably; it has the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] condition and is suffocating. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The effect also ends on any creature targeted by a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration-xphb|Lesser Restoration]] spell.
