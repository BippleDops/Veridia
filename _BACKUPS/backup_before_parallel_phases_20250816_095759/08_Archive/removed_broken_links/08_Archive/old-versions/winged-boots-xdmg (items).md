--- # Winged Boots

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/winged-boots.webp#right) These boots have 4 charges and regain`d4`expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the boots, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic action to expend 1 charge, gaining a [Fly Speed Xphb]] of 30 feet for 1 hour. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 325.
