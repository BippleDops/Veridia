A supernatural crisis quest where an ancient evil stirs in the deepest ocean trenches, sending disturbing sounds and psychic disturbances throughout Aquabyssos. Citizens report hearing whispers in their dreams, and some have begun sleepwalking toward the depths.

2. Government recruits team for emergency supernatural response
3. Ancient prophecy identifies party as potential ritual performers
4. Character's family member severely affected by psychic influence

## Moral Dimensions
