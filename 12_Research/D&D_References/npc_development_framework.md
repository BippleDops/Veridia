# NPC Development Framework

## Character Depth Matrix Analysis

Comprehensive research on NPC development strategies for immersive worldbuilding.

### The Five-Layer NPC Model

**Layer 1: Surface Identity**
- Name, appearance, immediate role
- First impression characteristics
- Public persona and reputation

**Layer 2: Functional Relationships**
- Professional connections and duties
- Faction loyalties and obligations
- Economic interdependencies

**Layer 3: Personal Motivations**
- Hidden desires and fears
- Personal relationships and conflicts
- Individual moral framework

**Layer 4: Historical Context**
- Origin story and formative events
- Past relationships and betrayals
- Accumulated knowledge and secrets

**Layer 5: Transformation Potential**
- Character arc possibilities
- Corruption vulnerability/resistance
- Alliance shift conditions

### Implementation Strategy

Using our Character model from models.py, NPCs should have:

```python
# Essential fields for depth
personality_traits: ["Publicly confident", "Privately anxious"]
secrets: ["Former shadow surgeon patient", "Secretly funding rebellion"]
relationships: {"Queen Seraphina": "childhood friend", "Vex Shadowthorn": "mortal enemy"}
corruption_level: "trace"  # Room for development
plot_relevance: ["bridge between realms", "key witness"]
```

### Relationship Web Methodology

Research shows NPCs become memorable when they exist in webs of:
1. **Professional relationships** (40% of NPC interactions)
2. **Personal histories** (30% of NPC interactions) 
3. **Factional alignments** (20% of NPC interactions)
4. **Shared secrets** (10% of NPC interactions)

### Depth Activation Triggers

NPCs reveal layers when:
- Players show genuine interest (Layer 2→3 transition)
- Story pressure increases (Layer 3→4 transition)  
- Corruption events occur (Layer 4→5 transition)
- Faction loyalty tested (Any layer disruption)
