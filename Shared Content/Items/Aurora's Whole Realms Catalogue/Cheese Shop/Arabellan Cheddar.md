## Description
The most popular cheddar cheese of the Sea of Fallen Stars, this sturdy, orange cheese is the definitive cheddar from the Dragon’s Mere to the borders of Thay. I order only the best of this cheddar, made in Arabel and shipped from the port of Suzail. Cured Cormyrean cheddar travels extremely well, and is the adventurer’s choice in dependable cheeses; Arabellan is the best of the entire breed. Available in 1 lb wheels (4 sp) or 100 lbs circular wheys (35 gp).
