# Aerisi Kalinoth

## Lair actions
_Source: Princes of the Apocalypse_

If Aerisi is in the air node while [Yan-C-Bin](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/yan-c-bin-pota.md) isn't, Aerisi can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Aerisi uses a lair action to cast one of her spells, up to 3rd level, without using components or a spell slot. She can't cast the same spell two rounds in a row, although she can continue to concentrate on a spell she previously cast using a lair action. Aerisi can take no other lair actions while [concentrating](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Concentration) on a spell cast as a lair action.

If Aerisi casts [invisibility](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility-xphb.md) using this lair action, she also draws the power of the air node into herself. By doing so, she regains 15 (`3d8 + 2`) hit points.
