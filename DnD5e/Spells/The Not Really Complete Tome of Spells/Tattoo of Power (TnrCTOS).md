# Tattoo of Power (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 hour

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (tattoo inks worth 10 gp per spell level and a needle, all of which is consumed in the casting of this spell)

**Duration**: Until triggered


## Effects
You tattoo a spell onto a willing creature’s skin. While you cast this spell, you also cast the spell you wish to tattoo—you may use a higher-level spell slot when casting that spell, if you wish. The creature may release the spell at any time by touching it and speaking a command word. This causes the tattoo to disappear and that spell to be cast.

Each tattoo takes up two square inches per level. Up to two spell levels can be tattooed on a neck, up to four levels can be tattooed on an arm, up to six levels can be tat-tooed on a leg, and up to ten levels can be tattooed on the chest or back.

No more than four different *tattoos of power* can be placed on a single individual at a time.
