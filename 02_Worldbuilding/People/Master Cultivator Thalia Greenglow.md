# Master Cultivator Thalia Greenglow
*The Bridge-Builder, She Who Grows in Dark Waters, Guardian of the Synthesis*

## Overview
Master Cultivator Thalia Greenglow represents one of the most extraordinary achievements of the combined worlds: a druid who has successfully merged surface plant magic with deep-sea cultivation techniques, creating entirely new forms of life that can thrive in both realms. Working in the miraculous [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Synthesis Gardens]] between [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], she cultivates plants that bridge the gap between crystal magic and natural growth, offering hope for cooperation between the two worlds.
