# Memory Merchant Wizard - Character Build

## Overview
The Memory Merchant represents a unique magical tradition that treats memories as valuable commodities to be bought, sold, traded, and refined. These wizards have mastered the complex magic of consciousness, memory, and identity, operating in the gray areas between legitimate magical services and dangerous mental manipulation. They serve as information brokers, trauma healers, and occasionally as agents of more sinister memory-related conspiracies.

## Core Concept
Memory Merchants are wizards who specialize in enchantment and divination magic related to consciousness and memory. They can extract painful memories to ease trauma, implant knowledge and skills, create perfect memory storage devices, and even trade memories between willing participants. Many operate legitimate businesses helping people recover from trauma or acquire new abilities, while others work in shadowy networks dealing in stolen memories and forbidden knowledge.
