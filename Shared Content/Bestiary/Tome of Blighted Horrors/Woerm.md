# Woerm
## Overview
### Woerm
![[upvr0qnu.eq5.png|Woerm|300]]
[[upvr0qnu.eq5.png|open outside]]

*This wormlike monster’s eyeless head has a hooked jaw and large, pointed ears. Its scaly hide is dull gray with a crest on its head and along its back to its tail, along which its shrunken, vestigial legs hang limply. Its long, multi-jointed arms are like slimy spider legs tipped with elongated, clawed hands.*

**Type**: Aberration

## Special Traits
**Blind:** Woerms rely entirely on blindsight. They are immune to gaze attacks, visual effects, illusions, and other effects that interact with normal sight.

**Filth Fever:** A creature with filth fever becomes sick `dice: 1d4` days after being infected. At that time, the creature gains 1 level of exhaustion. It also regains only half the usual number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from resting. Once symptoms appear, the infected creature must make a DC 11 Con saving throw after every long rest. If it fails, the creature gains 1 level of exhaustion; if it succeeds, the creature loses 1 level of exhaustion. The disease is cured when the creature has no exhaustion.

**Pack Attack:** A woerm has tactical advantage on its attack roll if the target is within 5 feet of another woerm that’s able to attack.

**Regeneration:** A woerm heals 5 hit points at the start of each of its turns. This ability doesn’t function if it took acid or fire damage, or was exposed to sunlight, since its previous turn.

**Stench:** A creature (other than a woerm or troglodyte) that starts its turn within 5 feet of a woerm must make a successful DC 11 Con saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. A creature that saves successfully is immune to woem Stench for 24 hours.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The woerm bites once and claws once.

**Melee Attack—Bite:** +5 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d4 + 3` piercing damage, and the creature must make a successful DC 11 Con saving throw or be infected with filth fever (see below).

**Melee Attack—Claws:** +5 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d6 + 3` slashing damage.

**Area Attack—Disorientating Scream:** Woerms communicate with their own kind via high-pitched screams. Creatures other than woerms within 15 feet of a screaming woerm must succeed at a DC 11 Wis saving throw or be incapacitated for 1 round. A character who makes this saving throw successfully is immune to woerms’ Disorientating Screams for 24 hours.

## Description
**Environment**: Underground

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, gang (3–12), or cult (13+)

Woerms are an aggressive, insular race who constantly hunger for flesh and who have become adept at survival in the crippling and stifling confines of the Underneath. Originally spawned of cursed unions between morlocks and troglodytes, they are rarely encountered and never above ground, as sunlight repels them.

Woerms are cautious when hunting, striking prey as they rush forth from hidden holes and disappear into others. This tactic has led to an impression that they enjoy playing with their prey — earning them the name “Welcomers Below” — but woerms delight only in eating.

Woerms are surprisingly sophisticated and intelligent — or at least, more sophisticated and intelligent than they look — and have complex and powerful clans and groups; two opposing groups of woerms never work together, but occasionally a great leader forges a larger kingdom of the creatures. These clans can last for decades or even centuries, and the feasting halls that rarely have been discovered have shown their appetites and successes. Occasionally, the insular woerms form an alliance with, or more often enslave, a race of subterranean dwellers, typically their morlock or troglodyte forebears.
