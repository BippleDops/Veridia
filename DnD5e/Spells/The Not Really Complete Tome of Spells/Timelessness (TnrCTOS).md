# Timelessness (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *9th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a gemstone worth at least 1,000 gp and a cylinder of obsidian, both of which are crushed in the casting)

**Duration**: 1 month


## Effects
You touch a creature, who, if unwilling must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, that creature is removed from time. You may declare while casting the spell how long you want this state to continue, up to 1 month.

A creature that has been removed from time is paralyzed, does not age, and does not need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep. It is immune to all forms of damage and all conditions.

A creature under the effect of this spell can only be freed by casting a *wish*.
