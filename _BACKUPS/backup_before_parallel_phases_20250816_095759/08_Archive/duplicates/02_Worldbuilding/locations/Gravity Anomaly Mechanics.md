## Overview

Gravity Anomaly Mechanics describe the complex magical and physical phenomena that occur when gravitational forces are disrupted, manipulated, or fundamentally altered in the regions around [[Aquabyssos and [Aethermoor]]. These anomalies represent one of the most dangerous and unpredictable environmental hazards affecting both realms, capable of reshaping landscapes, disrupting magical systems, and creating areas where normal physics no longer apply.

Unlike simple magical effects that temporarily alter gravity, true gravity anomalies represent fundamental distortions in the fabric of space-[[Time itself, creating lasting changes to the physical laws governing affected areas. Understanding these mechanics is crucial for navigating anomaly zones, predicting their effects, and developing countermeasures to protect populated areas and critical infrastructure.

### Gravitational  Zones

**Effect**: Complete absence of gravitational force within defined area
**Duration**: Permanent until actively dispelled
**Size**: Typically 50-200 feet in diameter
**Hazard Level**: Extreme

**Characteristics**: Objects and creatures within  zones experience weightlessness, with no preferred direction of "down." Movement requires propulsion or anchor points, and objects drift aimlessly without external force.

**Formation**: Usually result from catastrophic magical failures or interference between powerful magical forces that cancel gravitational effects.

**Environmental Impact**: Water forms floating spheres, debris creates chaotic obstacle fields, and normal architecture becomes unusable as foundations lose their anchoring force.

**Navigation**: Requires specialized equipment and techniques, with emphasis on controlled propulsion and careful momentum management to avoid becoming permanently stranded.

### Gravity Wells

**Effect**: Dramatically increased gravitational force, typically 3-10 times normal
**Duration**: Variable, from hours to permanent
**Size**: 20-100 foot radius with gradual dropoff
**Hazard Level**: High to Extreme

**Characteristics**: Crushing gravitational forces make movement difficult or impossible, while loose objects are violently drawn toward the center of the anomaly.

**Formation**: Created by concentration of massive magical energies or presence of extremely dense magical materials.

**Environmental Impact**: Landscape features are compressed and flattened, water flows are dramatically altered, and normal structures may collapse under increased gravitational stress.

**Survival**: Requires exceptional physical strength or magical protection to resist crushing forces, with most creatures unable to survive extended exposure.

### Gravity Storms

**Effect**: Rapidly shifting gravitational directions and intensities
**Duration**: 1-6 hours typically
**Size**: Several miles in diameter
**Hazard Level**: Extreme

**Characteristics**: Gravitational "down" changes direction every few seconds or minutes, with intensity varying from weightless to crushing force.

**Formation**: Result from interaction between multiple gravitational anomalies or interference from cosmic magical phenomena.

**Environmental Impact**: Causes widespread destruction as objects, water, and debris are repeatedly thrown in different directions, creating chaotic and dangerous conditions.

**Prediction**: Often preceded by minor gravitational fluctuations and magical disturbances that trained observers can detect hours in advance.

### Gravitational Shear Zones

**Effect**: Different gravitational forces affecting adjacent areas
**Duration**: Usually permanent once established
**Size**: Linear boundaries extending for miles
**Hazard Level**: Moderate to High

**Characteristics**: Sharp transitions between normal and altered gravity create dangerous boundary effects where objects are torn apart by differential forces.

**Formation**: Occur along fault lines between different magical fields or where competing gravitational anomalies meet.

**Environmental Impact**: Create natural barriers that are extremely difficult to cross, often becoming permanent geographical features.

**Navigation**: Require specialized techniques and equipment to safely traverse the boundary zones without being torn apart by differential forces.

### Gravity Inversions

**Effect**: Gravitational force reversed, pulling objects "upward"
**Duration**: Variable, often cyclical
**Size**: Moderate areas, typically 100-500 feet across
**Hazard Level**: High

**Characteristics**: Objects fall upward rather than down, with "up" becoming the new direction of gravitational pull.

**Formation**: Result from magical energies that create opposite polarity to normal gravitational fields.

**Environmental Impact**: Water flows upward, loose objects collect against ceilings or in the sky, and normal architecture becomes dangerously unstable.

**Adaptation**: Some areas develop specialized architecture and lifestyle adaptations to function in inverted gravity environments.

### Gravitational Sensors

**Mechanical Detection**: Simple pendulum devices that indicate gravitational direction and approximate intensity through deflection patterns.

**Magical Detection**: Specialized divination spells and magical instruments that can detect gravitational disturbances at distance and predict changes.

**Biological Indicators**: Certain creatures and plants show distinctive responses to gravitational anomalies, serving as early warning systems for approaching disturbances.

**Environmental Signs**: Changes in water flow, debris patterns, and atmospheric conditions often indicate gravitational anomalies before direct effects become apparent.

### Measurement Scales

**Intensity Scale**:
- Level 1: Minor fluctuations (10-25% variance from normal)
- Level 2: Moderate effects (25-100% variance)
- Level 3: Severe anomalies (100-500% variance)
- Level 4: Extreme distortions (500%+ variance or directional changes)
- Level 5: Catastrophic phenomena (complete gravitational breakdown)

**Stability Rating**:
- Stable: Consistent effects with predictable patterns
- Variable: Regular fluctuations within defined parameters
- Chaotic: Unpredictable changes without apparent pattern
- Critical: Potentially escalating toward more severe phenomena

**Hazard Assessment**:
- Green: Safe for normal activities with standard precautions
- Yellow: Requires specialized equipment and training
- Orange: Dangerous for all but essential activities
- Red: Evacuation recommended for non-specialists
- Black: Area completely inaccessible to conventional methods

### Underwater Environments

**Water Behavior**: Gravitational anomalies create complex current patterns, floating water masses, and disrupted pressure gradients that affect both navigation and marine life.

**Marine Life**: Fish and other aquatic creatures often become disoriented or injured by sudden gravitational changes, with some species evacuating affected areas entirely.

**Architecture**: Underwater structures must be designed to withstand gravitational stress in multiple directions, requiring specialized engineering and magical reinforcement.

**[Pressure Differential]]**: Altered gravity creates unusual pressure relationships between air and water, affecting breathing equipment and structural integrity.

**Navigation Complexity**: Transitional zones require navigation techniques that account for both underwater and surface gravitational effects simultaneously.

**[[Emergency Protocols**: Rescue and evacuation procedures must account for gravitational effects that may make normal emergency responses impossible.

### Spell Effects

**Enhancement**: Some spells are amplified by gravitational anomalies, particularly those involving force, movement, or spatial manipulation.

**Disruption**: Other magical effects are weakened or distorted by gravitational fields, requiring compensation or alternative approaches.

**Cancellation**: Certain combinations of gravitational anomalies and magical effects cancel each other out, creating temporary  zones for both phenomena.

**Resoce**: Magical energies sometimes resonate with gravitational disturbances, creating feedback loops that amplify both effects unpredictably.

### Magical Item Behavior
