# Illuminations
## Overview
Many epigrams speak to the importance of light. The elves commonly say, “One who lights a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items (WOTC)/Candle|candle]] awakens a small sun.” An old dwarf expression runs, “With a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items (WOTC)/Shovel|shovel]] I can dig a grave; give me a lantern too, and I’ll dig a home.” The ancient human proverb, “Seeing is believing,” can be matched in pragmatic wisdom only by the orcish saying, “Kill anything you see.” Clearly, even many of the foulest races seek some illumination. We offer not only the common lamps, lanterns, and other light sources, but also [[Implements|implements]] that can aid those with infra-vision, or extend sight into a deep fog. All of our devices of illumination come from the work-tables of the finest artisans, who use only the most pure, elegant, and durable materials. As well as lighting a home or providing aid to scriveners, our lighting accoutrements may prove as valuable as a broad-sword in the depths of a dungeon.
