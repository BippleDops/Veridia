# Trap #26 - "What's The Matter? Cat Got Your Tongue?!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> By now the party will have noticed that they can see their way around this vast chamber fairly well. This is because of the lambent light cast by a huge statue of a cat sitting on an island in the lake.
> 
> This is clearly no ordinary cat and no ordinary statue. It is over 15 feet tall, and made of a transparent emerald-like/substance. The light is odd in that it is not really bright. but very difficult to look at for long ô€ƒªods of time. The figure is obviously a cat but like no cat the delvers have ever seen. It is Jong bodied and obviously female. but it stands erect on ifs hind legs. It is also holding in one "hand" a staff.
> 
> The statue's eyes are the only things not carved from the same transparent green stone. They are difficult to see clearly, but they seem to be a rich topaz color, embedded in the statue.
> 
> The statue is facing a low pedestal upon which sets a stone coffin, covered with carvings. They depict a pair of figures, one a short male human and one a tall catlike creature. They appear to be locked in some kind of struggle.
> 
> If the party makes it to the island they will find.it to be an oval roughly 50 feet long, and 40 feet wide. It rises barely a foot above the lake's surface.
> 
> If any of the party's magic users have survived this far they will detect no magic from the coffin or the statue, but there is a great deal of nonactive magic on the staff, in the statues hand. This staff is made of the same substance as the statue, with the exception that the staff is veined throughout with a very fine latticework of gold wire.
> 
> The coffin will yield the same scenes of combat seen from the water, but in more detail. Clearly they depict a wizards duel between the catlike creature and Evinrood. It is likely that this island is mu;h associated with that conflict.
> 
> The coffin opens from the top. The lid can be removed with ease by any member of the party. The contents will at first seem to be a slab of the same translucent substance that makes up the cat statue. Lying under the emerald slab can be seen, vaguely, items of exotic jewelry, all cast in gold. This "slab" of emerald completely fills the bottom of the coffin, glittering. If any member of the party touches it, even with a sword or intermediary device, like a stick or staff, an immediate reaction will occur.
> 
> The "awful green stuff' is the horribly diabolical way Evinrood used to defeat the cat-deamon. It is an algae which he projected from a compartment in his staff. This enabled him to both defend himself from its attack and counterattack with devastating effect at the same time. The abilities of th is algae are threefold: first it will consume any carbon containing substance, second it grows extremely rapidly (so fast that it can seem to leap toward it's victims) and third it is very difficultto kill. The algae will lie dormant in the absence of"food" but once "food" presents itself the growth is explosive! This is where the delvers come in.
> 
> The "blob" will explode out of the coffin, and engulf the first character who comes in contact with it. (If a trapmaster is a real namby-pamby he could permit the character to drop the object up which the growth has occurred. Keep in mind this stuff is fast. There is only 40% chance (L6) of success.) After the character has been "consumed" the growth will be explosive. The island will be covered with a thin layer of algae in a matter of seconds. The delvers will be left with two options; dive back into the lake and all that that entailschomp- chomp-, or climb the cat statut and hope it is not edible, or attractive to the "blob".
> 
> The algae will stop at the water's edge. This is not an hospitable environment for this type of algae, as it is fresh water. The algae needs salt for its growth. If the party is in a position to watch they will see little fish come up and nibble the fringes of the algae as it comes into con tact with the water. They in turn are instantly dragged onto the island and turned into little blobs of algal mass. It cannot grow in the water but, it loses none of its potency, right up to the edge!
> 
> The party that has climbed up on the cat statue will notice that the eyes mentioned earlier are in fact giant gem stones. They will also note that the statue is laced throughout with microfine lines. The light comes from a hole beneath the base of the statue that opens into a volcanic pit. The glowing lava is somehow magnified by the construction features of this incredibly valuable statue. If the party attempts to remove the "eyes" they will cause the statue to shatter into millions of shards. (If they are hanging onto it they will be dumped to the ground, or the next closest thing if they work over the statue after opening the coffin.) The "eyes" will remain intact and have a value of 10,000 g.p. each!
> 
> If the party has attacked the statue before the coffin nothing else will happen. If the "blob" is loosed first, after the statue crumbles and the party has fallen into the "blob" and been consumed, the lava which has been held in check beneath the statue is released. This-is as a result of the releasing of a pressure plate in the bottom of the coffin. Once the "blob" has gone out hunting, the pressure will be released, and the quartz panel will be withdrawn,if the statue is destroyed. The lava will clean off the island of the last vestiges of the "blob". The party will only see this if they are in the water.
> 
> The only loose end in this whole setup is the staff the statue was holding. It is the staff of the catlike daemon that battled Evinrood. It will not be consumed by the "blob", and it will not be melted or burned by the lava. It still radiates powerful magic. If any member of the party touches this staff his or her brain will short out. He or she will become in effect a first level wizard with one heck of a magic staff. (The staff will act as a magical amplifier making it possible for the character who posseses it to cast spells at any level once it learns them. This will be without the usual costs.) The character will also be transformed into a 15 foot tall catlike crealure, with attributes and personality corresponding there too. The character will not remember anything of it's own past life and the brain patterns of the catwizard will nol be able to impress themselves on the ordinary delver brain. (Brains? Imagine that; delvers have brains! Who'd have thought such a thing?) IMPORTANT SURVIVAL TIP: Don't play with the toys of high level wizards.
> 
> There is a way out of this lake other than trying to crawl all lhe way back up the river. II the party, or what is left of it, looks around the wall to the right of the waterfall, they will find the ranks of dripping stalactites interrupted by.a column of green algae. This slimy pillar stretches up into the dim light until it reaches the roof of the cavern. If the gang of cavern crawlers inspects this more closely, they will find it to be the only practical exit from this chamber. Under the layers of algeal growth, the tomb trashing party will find a rust coated ladder, almost corroded through in places. Ascending this slimy tower will call for a fair amount of dexterity and daring, coated as it is with muck. There is a 30% chance (L3) of any given member in any given turn slipping, or of one of the cross ties giving way.
> 
> At the top will be found a stone hatch. Someone of above average strength must be at the top of the ladder to open the hatch. (If not, require saving rolls as they try to change places). There is a 20% chance (L2) that a rung of the ladder will break as he tries to lift the hatch. (The reason it is so heavy is that there is a chest of teasure sitting on top of it.) If they make it through, the party will find themselves coming up into Trap #39 from below.
> 
> The Blob is a four skull horror; speed and animal reflexes are essential. Not opening the Coffin is the best defense. The gold in the coffin is all that remains of the cat creature. The cat wizard infected by the blob was trapped in the coffin by Evinrood. The lava will clear off the island and melt the coffin.
