--- ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Modeling Complex Economic Systems in TTRPG Environments Research on implementing realistic economic manipulation and trade warfare mechanics. ### Multi-Layered Economic Model **Layer 1: Individual Transactions**

- Personal wealth and spending patterns
- Local trade and service exchange
- Barter systems and favor trading
- Individual corruption and graft **Layer 2: Organizational Economics**
- Faction resource management
- Guild monopolies and price controls
- Military ficing and equipment costs
- Criminal organization profit streams **Layer 3: Regional Markets**
- City-state trade balances
- Resource scarcity and abundance cycles - Transportation cost fluctuations
- Regional political stability effects **Layer 4: Inter-Realm Commerce**
- Cross-realm trade route control
- Exchange rate manipulation
- Embargo and blockade warfare
- Cultural preference arbitrage ### Economic Warfare Taxonomy **1. Market Manipulation** (35% of economic attacks):


**Summary**: Economic Warfare Taxonomy **1. Market Manipulation** (35% of economic attacks): - Key information at a glance.

- **Price Flooding**: Oversupply to crash competitor prices
- **Artificial Scarcity**: Hoarding to inflate demand
- **Quality Sabotage**: Damaging competitor reputation
- **Patent/Guild Lockouts**: Restricting access to techniques **2. Infrastructure Attacks** (25% of economic attacks):
- **Trade Route Disruption**: Piracy, banditry, blockades
- **Production Sabotage**: Destroying facilities and equipment
- **Transportation Monopoly**: Controlling shipping and movement
- **Communication Interference**: Disrupting business coordination **3. Political Economic Pressure** (20% of economic attacks):
- **Regulatory Capture**: Influencing laws to favor allies
- **Taxation Warfare**: Using government policy as weapon
- **Diplomatic Pressure**: Trade agreement manipulation
- **Currency Destabilization**: Attacking monetary systems **4. Information Warfare** (20% of economic attacks):
- **Trade Secret Theft**: Industrial espionage operations
- **Market Intelligence**: Insider trading and information asymmetry
- **Reputation Destruction**: Propaganda and rumor campaigns
- **False Scarcity**: Misinformation about resource availability ### Resource Interdependency Mapping **Aquabyssos Critical Resources:**

- **Pressure-forged Metals**: Deep mining operations, specialized techniques
- **Processed Air**: Life support systems, breathing apparatus manufacturing
- **Abyssal Pearls**: Depth cultivation, memory storage technology
- **Bio-luminescent Materials**: Deep creature harvesting, cultivation farms **Aethermoor Critical Resources:**
- **Resot Crystals**: High-altitude mining, harmonic amplification
- **Wind Essence**: Storm capture technology, movement magic
- **Cloud Water**: Precipitation harvesting, purification systems
- **Stellar Materials**: Sky forge operations, cosmic alignment timing **Cross-Realm Dependencies:**
- Communication crystals require both realm materials
- Transportation vessels need hybrid technology
- Magical items often require dual-realm components
- Military equipment benefits from combined resources ### Economic Vulnerability Assessment **Supply Chain Analysis:**

- Single points of failure in production chains
- Alternative source development possibilities
- Stockpile duration under blockade conditions
- Emergency substitution and rationing protocols **Market Concentration Risks:**
- Monopolistic control over critical resources
- Geographic clustering of production facilities
- Workforce specialization and training bottlenecks
- Technology transfer and knowledge dependencies ### Player Impact Mechanics **Economic Action Categories:**

- **Direct Intervention**: Physical disruption of trade activities
- **Market Participation**: Buying, selling, investing strategically
- **Political Influence**: Lobbying for favorable economic policies
- **Information Manipulation**: Spreading rumors, revealing secrets **Consequence Scaling:**
- **Individual Level**: Personal wealth, reputation, access
- **Organizational Level**: Faction resources, alliance stability
- **Regional Level**: City prosperity, population happiness
- **Realm Level**: Political stability, military capacity ### Implementation Framework Economic tracking models:```python

class Economic Node(Base Model): name: str resource_type: str production_capacity: int current_output: int dependencies: List[str] # Other nodes required for operation vulnerability_factors: List[str] # Points of potential disruption political_control: str # Which faction controls this node market_connections: List[str] # Where output flows class Trade Route(Base Model): start_location: str end_location: str transported_goods: List[str] security_level: Threat Level political_status: str # open, restricted, embargoed, contested transit_time: int cost_modifiers: Dict[str, float] # factors affecting price```### Simulation Mechanics **Price Fluctuation System:**

- Base prices modified by supply/demand ratios
- Political stability modifiers (-50% to +200%)
- Seasonal and environmental effects (Â±25%)
- Player action consequences (variable impact) **Economic Warfare Resolution:**
- Initiative system for economic actions
- Success/failure with multiple outcome possibilities
- Escalation mechanics and response opportunities
- Long-term consequence tracking *Research methodology: Economic game theory analysis, historical trade war studies, 12 economic warfare campaigns* ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*

- Can be adapted to fit current story needs
- Scalable threat/reward based on party level
- Multiple entry points for different play styles
- Connections to overarching campaign themes ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
