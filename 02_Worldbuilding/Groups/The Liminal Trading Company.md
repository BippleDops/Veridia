# The Liminal Trading Company
*Masters of Between-World Commerce, The Dimensional Merchants*

## Overview
The Liminal Trading Company has built a vast commercial empire based on the simple principle that different worlds have different resources, and where there are differences, there is profit. Operating from [[The Floating Market]]—a dimensional nexus that exists partially in both [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]—they facilitate trade between the realms while maintaining careful political neutrality. Their success comes from being indispensable to both worlds while belonging fully to neither.
