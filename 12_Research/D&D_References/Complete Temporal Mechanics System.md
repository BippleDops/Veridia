--- # Complete Temporal Mechanics System Builds time travel rules, paradox resolution, temporal combat, chrono-corruption, anomaly events, causal loops, and time-dilated zones. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Time Travel Procedures

1) Define Intent (when/where; personal scope or world scope)
2) Pay Cost (memories, sanity loss, anchor fuel)
3) Roll Timeline Check: 1d100 vs. Integrity with modifiers from [[Complete Reality Merger System]]
4) Resolve Paradox Risk; apply loop or branch per Resolution Rules ## Temporal Anomalies (d20 samples)

1 Lost hour â€¢ 2 Reverse rain â€¢ 3 Two dawns â€¢ 4 Child elder â€¢ 5 Future scar â€¢ 6 Yesterday news â€¢ 7 Late shadow â€¢ 8 Faded door â€¢ 9 Unborn echo â€¢ 10 Rust to sap â€¢ 11 Spoken tomorrow â€¢ 12 Clock melt â€¢ 13 Ancient smell â€¢ 14 Backward tide â€¢ 15 Premature ruin â€¢ 16 Posthumous visitor â€¢ 17 Looping bell â€¢ 18 Twin path â€¢ 19 Midnight at noon â€¢ 20 Leap month ## Time-Dilated Zones

- Fast/Slow/Stopped bands; pressure/altitude modifiers interact with time flow
- Long exposure: Aging/regression risks; sanity checks Integration: [[Complete Reality Merger System]], [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]], [[Memory Trading Economy System|Memory Economy]], [[Deep Mother]]. ## Player-Facing Summary Complete Temporal Mechanics System is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Complete Temporal Mechanics System as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Complete Temporal Mechanics System. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A document has gone missing and chaos spreads

- A prisoner has gone missing and war looms
- Someone is protecting information for love ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
