## Description
I am fishing on the lake by my house when I see two dragonflies flying with tails joined. Then two more, these with one on top of the other. So I watched and saw how they all liked to fly that way; I thought I should make a machine that would let two people fly together. 

First I tried the [[Air Screw|air screw]], but another person below the screw caught too much wind. We pumped harder and harder but to no use. The frame broke. The whirling part hit my assistant and so he left. I gave up on the screw. I went back to the dragonfly. 

I put two wings on each side, like for the dragonfly: two men could make more force. The wings have a pivot over the wheel and a [[Hinge|hinge]] to a coarse screw. One man sits on each side, strapped to the frame. The heavier man steps and pulls on the wheel and the wings go down. The lighter steps and pulls and they go up. (95 gp)

## Additional Details
chance of failure per round equals average weight minus average Str and Dex \[e.g., (130 lb + 90 lb)/2 - ((Str 16 + Str 14)/2 + (Con 13 + Con 17)/2) = 80% chance of failure per round]; when successful, can rise 20 ft per round and move at 15; regular falling damage applies for failure; magical alteration to weight, Str, and Con apply
