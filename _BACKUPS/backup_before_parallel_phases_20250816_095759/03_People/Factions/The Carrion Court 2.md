# The Carrion Court
*In Death We Find True Nobility*

## Overview
The Carrion Court is an aristocratic hierarchy of undead beings that maintains the twisted traditions of an ancient noble court from beyond the grave. Led by **Lich-Queen Morwyn the Deathless**, this organization of vampires, liches, wraiths, and other powerful undead seeks to establish a kingdom where death is merely a transition to higher nobility rather than an ending. They operate with the pomp, ceremony, and political intrigue of a living court, but with the power and immortal patience of the undead.
