--- # Windvane

*Weapon ([[Eldritch Spear Xphb]]), legendary (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/windvane.webp#right) - **Damage**: - One-handed: `dice: 1d6` piercing - Two-handed: `dice: 1d8` piercing
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [[item properties#Finesse|Finesse, [item properties#Thrown|Thrown]], [[item properties#Versatile|Versatile
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs. A silver spear, Windvane has dark sapphires on the filigreed surface of its polished head. Held by its shining haft, the weapon feels insubstantial, as if clutching a cool, gently flowing breeze. The spear contains a spark of [Yan C Bin Pota]], the Prince of Evil Air. You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has the finesse weapon property. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra`d6`lightning damage. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Air Mastery You gain the following benefits while you hold Windvane: - You can speak Auran fluently. - You have resistance to lightning damage. - You can cast [[Dominate Monster Xphb (save **DC 17**) on an [elemental]]. Once you have done so, Windvane can't be used this way again until the next dawn. ## Song of the Four Winds While inside an air node, you can perform a ritual called the Song of the Four Winds, using Windvane to create a [[devastation-orb-of-air-pota (items). Once you perform the ritual, Windvane can't be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn. ## Flaw Windvane makes its wielder mercurial and unreliable. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I break my vows and plans. Duty and honor mean nothing to me." *Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 224* ## Player-Facing Summary Windvane pota is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of windvane pota as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around windvane pota. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [Master_Item_Catalog]]
