## Special Traits
***Rancid Degeneration.*** At the end of each of the troll's turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes 11 ( `dice: 2d10`) necrotic damage, unless the troll has taken acid or fire damage since the end of its last turn.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The troll makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ( `dice: 1d6+4`) piercing damage plus 16 ( `dice: 3d10`) necrotic damage.

***Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ( `dice: 2d6+4`) slashing damage plus 5 ( `dice: 1d10`) necrotic damage.

## Description
A troll that is infused with waves of necrotic energy as it regenerates can develop a symbiotic relationship with that deathly power. The troll's body withers, and its flesh falls away from the body as quickly as it forms. Eventually a rot troll becomes unable to regenerate, though it still heals normally. The creature courses with necrotic energy that flows out of its withered form. Simply standing near a rot troll exposes other creatures to its lethal emanations.
