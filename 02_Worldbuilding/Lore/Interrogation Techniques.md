# Interrogation Techniques

*"Truth flows like water - apply the right pressure and it will find its way out."*

## Overview

Interrogation Techniques in the dual-realm world have evolved to account for the unique challenges of questioning suspects who may come from radically different cultural backgrounds, possess magical abilities, or have been affected by inter-dimensional phenomena. These methods combine traditional investigative approaches with specialized techniques for magical subjects and cross-cultural communication.

## Mechanics

### Requirements

- Training in both surface and underwater interrogation methods
- Magical detection and protection capabilities
- Cultural sensitivity training for inter-realm subjects
- Proper legal authorization and oversight

### Effects

- **Truth Extraction**: Obtaining accurate information from subjects
- **Cultural Navigation**: Avoiding misunderstandings due to different customs
- **Magical Countermeasures**: Dealing with enchanted or corrupted subjects
- **Legal Compliance**: Maintaining admissible evidence standards

### Duration

Interrogation sessions typically last 1-4 hours with breaks for subject welfare.

## Adventure Hooks

1. **Interrogation Training**: Characters learn advanced questioning techniques
2. **Resistant Subject**: Interview someone with unusual magical or cultural protections
3. **False Information**: Determine truth when multiple suspects give conflicting stories

## Campaign Use

Provides framework for investigation scenes and adds realism to law enforcement encounters.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
