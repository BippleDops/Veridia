## Alertness

While holding the rod, you have [[Advantage Xphb]] on Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) checks and on [[Initiative Xphb]] rolls. Spells. While holding the rod, you can cast the following spells from it:

- [[detect-evil-and-good-xphb (spells)]]  
- [[detect-magic-xphb (spells)]]  
- [[detect-poison-and-disease-xphb (spells)]]  
- [[see-invisibility-xphb (spells)]]  

## Protective Aura

As a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's head sheds [[Light Xphb]] in a 60-foot radius and [[Light Xphb]] for an additional 60 feet. While in that [[Light Xphb]], you and your allies gain a +1 bonus to [[armor-class-xphb (variant-rules)]] and saving throws and can sense the location of any [[conditions#Invisible|Invisible]] creature that is also in the [[Light Xphb]].

The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes or when a creature takes a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to pull the rod from the ground. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
