# Session 4: The Deep Mother Stirs

*Level 4-5 Characters | 3-4 Hours | Investigation/Horror*

## Session Overview

The party's investigation into the strange memory loss epidemic leads them deeper into Aquabyssos's ancient secrets. As they follow the trail of missing memories, they uncover signs that something vast and terrible is beginning to wake in the deepest trenches of the ocean. The Fourth Shard's influence grows stronger, and the party must confront the reality that their quest may have already set apocalyptic events in motion.

## Opening Scene: The Memory Harvest

The session begins in the **Depth Archive**, where [[Archivist Coral-Mind Preserver]] has been working tirelessly to understand the memory extraction patterns the party discovered.

### Read Aloud
*The Archive's bioluminescent reading chambers cast an eerie blue-green glow over countless memory pearls floating in preservation tanks. Archivist Coral-Mind looks up from her work, her usually steady hands trembling slightly.*

*"I've analyzed the memory fragments you recovered," she says, her voice hollow. "The patterns... they're not random. Someone is harvesting specific memories - all related to ancient knowledge about the Deep Trenches. Knowledge that was buried for good reason."*

### Key Information Revealed
- **Memory Pattern**: Only memories about deep ocean lore, ancient warnings, and protective rites are being stolen
- **Timeline**: The memory thefts began exactly when the party started seeking the Seven Shards
- **Disturbing Detail**: The extracted memories show signs of being "fed" to something vast and hungry
- **Ancient Warning**: References to "She Who Dreams in the Abyss" keep appearing in the stolen memory fragments

## Investigation Phase: Following the Deep Current

The party must track the source of the memory extractions through Aquabyssos's underground network.

### Clue 1: The Forgotten Ward
**Location**: [[Ancient Memorial District]]

The party discovers that an entire district's worth of protective wards against "deep things" have been systematically dismantled. The ward-stones show signs of being dissolved by some kind of psychic acid.

- **Investigation (DC 15)**: The dissolution pattern matches the memory extraction technique
- **History (DC 18)**: These wards were placed here after the "Silent Century" - a period erased from most historical records
- **Arcana (DC 20)**: The wards were specifically designed to contain something that feeds on knowledge itself

### Clue 2: The Dreaming Cultists
**Location**: [[Hidden Shrine of Forgotten Depths]]

Following energy traces, the party finds a secret cult dedicated to [[The Deep Mother]]. The cultists are in a trance state, continuously feeding stolen memories into a massive obsidian pool.

**Encounter**: 
- 1 **Deep Oracle** (use Priest stats with psychic abilities)
- 4 **Memory Thralls** (use Cultist stats, but attacks drain memories temporarily)
- 2 **Void Touched** (use Wraith stats, but incorporeal and feed on thoughts)

#### Tactical Notes
- The obsidian pool glows brighter as memories are fed into it
- Each round the pool remains active, characters within 30 feet must make Wisdom saves (DC 14) or lose access to one random spell/ability until next long rest
- Destroying the feeding apparatus requires either dispelling the magic (DC 18) or dealing 50 damage to the pool

### Clue 3: The Tidal Prophecy
**Location**: [[Observatory of Sunken Stars]]

The party finds [[Prophet Nerida Voidgazer]], one of the few people who remembers the ancient warnings. She's been hiding, knowing that her knowledge makes her a target.

### Read Aloud
*The old prophet's eyes are milky white with cataracts, but they seem to see through dimensions. When she speaks, her voice echoes as if coming from a great depth.*

*"The Fourth Shard you seek... it was not lost, child. It was hidden. Bound. Used as a lock to keep Her sleeping. Every shard you claim weakens that binding. She stirs now, in dreams that shake the ocean floor."*

#### Prophecy Revealed
*"Seven Shards to rule the depths complete,  
But four awakens what should never meet.  
The Mother dreams of stars again,  
When memory's thief breaks the chain.  
In deepest trench where light has died,  
The Fourth Shard serves to stem the tide."*

**Key Information**:
- The Fourth Shard is acting as a binding agent, keeping [[The Deep Mother]] in dormancy
- Claiming it will begin her awakening process
- The memory thefts are her way of "remembering" how to influence the waking world
- The party now faces a terrible choice: abandon their quest or risk apocalypse

## The Deep Calling

As the session progresses, all characters begin experiencing psychological effects from [[The Deep Mother]]'s growing influence.

### Hourly Madness Effects
Each hour of the session, have all players roll a d20:
- **1-3**: Hear whispered words in an ancient language (Wisdom save DC 12 or take 1d4 psychic damage)
- **4-6**: Experience brief visions of impossible ocean depths (Disadvantage on next skill check)
- **7-9**: Feel compelled to move toward deep water (Wisdom save DC 15 or spend turn moving toward nearest large body of water)
- **10+**: No immediate effect, but gain one point of "Deep Calling" (track this)

### Deep Calling Corruption
Characters who accumulate 3+ Deep Calling points begin to change:
- **3 Points**: Can breathe underwater indefinitely, but feel uncomfortable in shallow water
- **5 Points**: Gain darkvision 120 feet, but bright light causes pain (disadvantage in sunlight)
- **7 Points**: Can communicate telepathically with other corrupted creatures, but struggle to speak aloud
- **10 Points**: Character becomes NPC under DM control, now serving [[The Deep Mother]]

## Major Decision Point: The Fourth Shard

The party discovers the location of the [[Fourth Shard of Binding]] in the **Leviathan Graveyard**, a massive trench where ancient sea creatures go to die. But getting there requires passing through areas where [[The Deep Mother]]'s influence is strongest.

### Options Presented
1. **Claim the Shard**: Continue the quest knowing it will accelerate the apocalypse
2. **Abandon the Quest**: Leave the shard as a binding, but fail their primary mission
3. **Seek Alternative**: Try to find another way to contain [[The Deep Mother]] while still claiming the shard

### Information Gathering
If the party seeks more information:
- **Ancient texts** reveal that [[The Deep Mother]] was bound by a coalition of the first Mer-Folk rulers and Aethermoor wind-mages working together
- **Historical records** show that similar awakenings can be countered, but require artifacts from both realms
- **Current intelligence** suggests that someone in Aethermoor is also seeking the Seven Shards, possibly for similar world-threatening purposes

## Climactic Encounter: The Leviathan Graveyard

If the party chooses to proceed, they must navigate the treacherous **Leviathan Graveyard**.

### Environmental Hazards
- **Crushing Depths**: Pressure increases every 10 minutes (Constitution saves, DC starts at 10, increases by 2 each check)
- **Psychic Storms**: [[The Deep Mother]]'s dreams create reality distortions (Wisdom saves DC 16 or experience terrifying hallucinations)
- **Leviathan Bones**: Massive skeletal remains create a maze - wrong turns lead to dead ends or dangerous encounters

### The Guardian of the Fourth Shard

**The Forgotten Leviathan** - An ancient whale-like creature that has been guarding the shard for millennia, slowly being corrupted by [[The Deep Mother]]'s influence.

**Stats**: Use Ancient Dragon stats but aquatic, with these modifications:
- **HP**: 200 (reduced from normal ancient dragon)
- **AC**: 18 (bone armor)
- **Speed**: 60 ft swim
- **Damage Resistances**: Cold, Necrotic
- **Condition Immunities**: Charmed, Frightened
- **Breath Weapon**: Sonic blast in 90-foot cone (6d8 thunder damage, DC 18 Constitution save for half, deafens for 1 minute on failure)
- **Memory Drain**: Once per turn, can attempt to steal memories from target within 60 feet (Charisma save DC 18 or lose access to highest level spell slot/ability until long rest)

### Tactical Considerations
- The Leviathan is being influenced by [[The Deep Mother]] but fights it
- Characters can attempt to help it resist (Persuasion DC 20 or Remove Curse)
- If freed from influence, it becomes an ally and warns about the true danger
- The Fourth Shard sits in the creature's rib cage, pulsing with binding energy

## Resolution and Consequences

### If the Party Claims the Fourth Shard
- Immediate psychic shock wave felt throughout Aquabyssos
- NPCs throughout the realm begin having nightmares
- The ocean itself seems to "shiver" with anticipation
- **The Deep Mother** begins actively influencing events (future sessions will show her growing power)
- Party gains powerful artifact but knows they've triggered something terrible

### If the Party Leaves the Shard
- The binding remains stable for now
- Other forces seeking the Seven Shards may eventually claim it anyway
- Party must find alternative methods to achieve their original goals
- **The Deep Mother** remains dormant but other threats may emerge

### If the Party Seeks Alternatives
- Opens up possibilities for cross-realm cooperation with Aethermoor
- Could lead to a larger alliance against cosmic threats
- More complex solutions that might satisfy both protection and power needs

## Session Rewards

### Experience Points
- **Base XP**: 1,200 XP per character for completing investigation
- **Bonus XP**: 
  - +200 XP for making the moral choice (regardless of which choice)
  - +300 XP for defeating the Forgotten Leviathan
  - +100 XP for discovering the true nature of the memory thefts

### Treasure
- **The Fourth Shard** (if claimed): Legendary artifact - can control tides, speak with all sea creatures, cast *tsunami* once per day
- **Memory Pearls**: 3d4 pearls containing ancient knowledge (each worth 500 gp or can be used to learn obscure information)
- **Leviathan Bone Talisman**: +2 to saves against psychic effects, can cast *fear* (save DC 15) once per long rest
- **Deep Current Map**: Shows hidden paths through the deepest parts of Aquabyssos

### Story Developments

- Political tensions in Aquabyssos escalate as people have nightmares about the deep
- Contact opportunities with Aethermoor increase
- The remaining three shards' locations become more urgent to discover

## GM Notes

### Managing Horror Elements
- Keep the horror psychological rather than purely visceral
- Use the Deep Calling corruption as a slow-burn threat
- Allow characters to retain agency even while experiencing supernatural influences
- Build tension through environmental details and NPC reactions

### Adapting Player Choices
- If players are hesitant to make the moral choice, have NPCs they care about be affected by the growing influence
- If players immediately go for the shard without consideration, have prophetic NPCs deliver warnings
- Be prepared for players to try unexpected solutions - the goal is meaningful choice, not railroading

### Setting Up Future Sessions
- The party's choice here fundamentally changes the campaign's direction
- Start planning how [[The Deep Mother]]'s influence will manifest in coming sessions
- Consider how this affects the political intrigue subplots
- Begin foreshadowing the connection between Aquabyssos and Aethermoor threats

### Connection to Larger Campaign
- This session should feel like a major turning point
- The psychological horror elements here contrast with the political intrigue of earlier sessions
- Start planting seeds for the revelation that both realms face connected cosmic threats
- Use this as an opportunity to deepen character motivations and bonds
