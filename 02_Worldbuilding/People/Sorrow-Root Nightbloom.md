## Overview
Once a member of [[The Verdant Accord]], Sorrow-Root Nightbloom now leads the Withered Court, a radical splinter faction that believes the only way to save nature is to weaponize it against civilization. They've begun experimenting with controlled corruption to create "crystal-eating" plants.

## The Withered Court
A growing faction of druids, rangers, and fey who believe that:
- Civilization must fall for nature to survive
- Crystal corruption can be turned against itself
- The [[The Seven Shards]] should be destroyed or corrupted beyond use
- Anyone who uses crystals deserves death

## DM Secrets
> [!warning] The Green Death
> Sorrow-Root has successfully created a fungal plague that feeds on crystal energy. Released in a populated area, it would kill anyone with any crystal exposure (nearly everyone) within days. They're waiting for the right moment to deploy it.

> [!danger] The True Horror
> Sorrow-Root isn't entirely wrong - they've discovered that the crystals are actually eggs of an extraplanar parasite. Their extreme methods might be the only thing preventing an even worse catastrophe, making them a villain who might be accidentally saving the world.

> [!info] Hidden Humanity
> Sorrow-Root maintains a secret garden where they keep one uncorrupted tree from their childhood home. If it dies or is corrupted, they plan to release the Green Death immediately. This tree is their last anchor to sanity.
