## Overview

Underwater Breathing represents the collective term for the sophisticated life support technologies that enable human habitation in [[Aquabyssos. These systems combine magical enhancement, biological adaptation, technological innovation, and environmental manipulation to allow citizens to breathe naturally in aquatic environments while maintaining the physiological functions necessary for normal human life.

The technology encompasses personal breathing apparatus, city-wide atmospheric management, [Emergency Life Support]] systems, and [[Biological Enhancement Procedures that work together to create breathable environments throughout the underwater city. These systems integrate closely with the [Pressure Adaptation System]] to provide comprehensive life support that addresses both pressure and respiratory needs.

Modern underwater breathing systems have evolved far beyond simple air supply mechanisms to include oxygen extraction from seawater, carbon dioxide processing, atmospheric composition management, and emergency backup systems that ensure citizen survival even during major system failures.
