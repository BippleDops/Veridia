# Bards' Emporium
## Overview
When I was young, I thought music fairly useless. It did not stop hunger, grant warmth, save life, cover nudity, quench thirst, turn rain, or perform any other worthwhile service, as far as I could tell. I was at that time too young and too practical to admit “soothing the heart” or “rousing the spirit” as true justifications for music. However, years spent at the mercy of the wandering trail and the storm-prone sky taught me to value a cheery song even above a hot meal or warm bed. Therefore, I offer only the finest quality instruments, each of them inspected and approved by the Waterdhavian Council of Musicians, Instrument Makers, and Choristers. As well as offering the instruments themselves, we allow special requests for blessing by the priests of Milil at double the instrument’s list cost and twice the ordering time. When ordering instruments for ensembles, remember that instruments crafted in disparate geographical or cultural areas may not be compatible in pitch. 

But bards do not live by instruments alone. I am pleased to also offer many of the accoutrements that bards need for the recitation of verse and the execution of drama. Read through the section that follows the instruments and discover there the many helps we provide for working wonder in the hearts of audiences.
