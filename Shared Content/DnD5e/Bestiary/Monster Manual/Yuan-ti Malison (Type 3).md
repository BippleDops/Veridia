At will: *animal friendship (snakes only)*
3/day: *suggestion*

***Shapechanger.*** The yuan-ti can use its action to polymorph into a Medium snake, or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It doesn't change form if it dies.

***Magic Resistance.*** The yuan-ti has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Type 1: Human body with snake head

Type 2: Human head and body with snakes for arms

## Description
A malison is a hideous blend of human and serpentine features. Three different types of malisons are known to exist, and other types are possible. Malisons form the middle caste of yuan-ti society and hunt with arrows tipped with their own venom. They use their magical powers of suggestion to force their enemies' surrender.
