## Description
Southern brews, including these Calishite beers, are rare, interesting, and lighter drinks called lager. They are lighter in taste, color, and weight and have more effervescence. Golden sands brews come in varying types, each with different additives to alter the taste of the base lager. These are available only through ports at Baldurâ€™s Gate and Waterdeep, though we will attempt to distribute to a wider clientele in the near future. Prices for all golden sands beers are the same: Hand keg, 2 sp; cask, 1 gp; barrel, 25 sp; butt, 8 gp; tun, 16 gp. The following are the variants of this Calimport brew:

***Golden Sands Basic***: Unadulterated lager with no added flavorings after brewing. It has a pale yellow color, white foam, and light bubbles.

**Golden Sands Gold:** The basic brew specially fortified with extracts from cacti and nettles, giving the beer a sharp, more bitter aftertaste and its deeper golden color.

**Golden Sands Orange:** Braced with flavor of orange and currant, this unique lager has an acidic aftertaste, but is sweeter than the basic lager.
