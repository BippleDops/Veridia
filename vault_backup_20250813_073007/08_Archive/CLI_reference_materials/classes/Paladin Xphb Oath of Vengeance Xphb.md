## Class Features

### Oath of Vengeance (Level 3)

*Punish Evildoers at Any Cost*

The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed grievously evil acts. When evil armies slaughter helpless villagers, when a tyrant defies the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too violent, when a dragon rampages through the countryside—at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right what has gone wrong.

These paladins share the following tenets:

- Show the wicked no mercy.  
- Fight injustice and its causes.  
- Aid those harmed by injustice.  

### Oath of Vengeance Spells (Level 3)

The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Vengeance Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

**Oath of Vengeance Spells**

| Paladin Level | Spells |
|---------------|--------|
| 3rd | [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/bane-xphb|Bane]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/hunters-mark-xphb|Hunter's Mark]] |
| 5th | [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/hold-person-xphb|Hold Person]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/misty-step-xphb|Misty Step]] |
| 9th | [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/haste-xphb|Haste]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/protection-from-energy-xphb|Protection from Energy]] |
| 13th | [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/banishment-xphb|Banishment]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/dimension-door-xphb|Dimension Door]] |
| 17th | [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/hold-monster-xphb|Hold Monster]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/scrying-xphb|Scrying]] |
^oath-of-vengeance-spells

### Vow of Enmity (Level 3)

When you take the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Attack|Attack]] action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until you use this feature again.

If the creature drops to 0 [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] before the vow ends, you can transfer the vow to a different creature within 30 feet of yourself (no action required).

### Relentless Avenger (Level 7)

Your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe's retreat. When you hit a creature with an [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Opportunity%20Attack|Opportunity Attack]], you can reduce the creature's [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb|Speed]] to 0 until the end of the current turn. You can then move up to half your [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb|Speed]] as part of the same [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb|Reaction]]. This movement doesn't provoke [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Opportunity%20Attack|Opportunity Attacks]].

### Soul of Vengeance (Level 15)

Immediately after a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity hits or misses with an attack roll, you can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb|Reaction]] to make a melee attack against that creature if it's within range.

### Avenging Angel (Level 20)

As a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]], you gain the benefits below for 10 minutes or until you end them (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]]. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).

#### Flight

You sprout spectral wings on your back, have a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/fly-speed-xphb|Fly Speed]] of 60 feet, and can hover.

#### Frightful Aura

Whenever an enemy starts its turn in your Aura of Protection, that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Frightened|Frightened]] condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Attack|Attack]] rolls against the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Frightened|Frightened]] creature have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb|Advantage]].
