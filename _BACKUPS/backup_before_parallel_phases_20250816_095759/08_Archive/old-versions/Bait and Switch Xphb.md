--- # Bait and Switch

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 94* When you're within 5 feet of a creature on your turn, you can expend one Superiority Die and switch places with that creature, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement and the creature is willing and doesn't have the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated condition. This movement doesn't provoke [actions#Opportunity%20Attack|Opportunity Attacks]]. Roll the Superiority Die. Until the start of your next turn, you or the other creature (your choice) gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Bait and switch xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
