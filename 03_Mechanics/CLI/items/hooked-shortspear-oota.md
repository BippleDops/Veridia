- **Damage**: 1d4 piercing
- **Properties**: [Light](/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties.md#Light)
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

On a hit with this weapon, the wielder can forgo dealing damage and attempt to trip the target, in which case the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall [prone](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Prone). The DC is 8 + the wielder's Strength modifier + the wielder's proficiency bonus.
