## Special Traits
**Mesmerizing Gaze:** As a bonus action, a wolfwere in wolf or human form can target one living creature within 30 feet and line of sight with its mesmerizing gaze. If the targeted creature can see the wolfwere, then the targeted creature must make a successful DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be stunned for `dice: 1d4` rounds. A creature that is capable of taking actions can, at the start of its turn, look away to avoid the wolfweres gaze for one complete round. If it targets the wolfwere while averting its gaze, it suffers all the usual penalties for attacking an unseen target. Creatures that are blind, unconscious, or unable to see the wolfwere for any other reason are immune to this attack.

**Shapechanger:** The wolfwere can change from its wolf form or human form to its hybrid form as a bonus action. Changing from wolf form directly to human form or vice versa takes an action. In wolf form, it is indistinguishable from a normal wolf.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** In hybrid form, a wolfwere makes two melee attacks, one of which can be with its scimitar. In human or fox form, it makes one melee attack and can also use its mesmerizing gaze.

**Bite (wolf form):** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (`dice: 2d4+3`) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 11 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Claws (hybrid form):** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d6+3`) slashing damage.

**Scimitar (human/hybrid form):** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d6+3`) slashing damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Cold or temperate plains and underground

**Organization**: Solitary, gang (2–5), or pack (1 plus 5–8 wolves)

## Description
In humanoid form, a wolfwere appears as a normal humanoid, often with gray or gray-streaked hair and dark gray eyes. Unlike most other therianthropes, wolfweres are social and gregarious. They love boisterous company, whether their companions are other wolfweres, normal wolves, or a tavern full of humanoids. They never stay in one place for very long (an attribute they share with many adventurers), because they’re afflicted with incurable wanderlust, always wondering what’s beyond the bordering forest or in the next valley across the hills. Fortunately for them, their sense of direction is unerring. A wolfwere might not always know precisely where it is, but it can always find its way back to where it came from—assuming it’s ever interested in retracing its steps and seeing the same sites twice.
