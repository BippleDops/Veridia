# Dock Worker Tomás

*"Twenty years loading cargo, and I still don't understand half of what comes up from the deep."*

## Overview

Tomás Saltwhistle is a weathered dock worker in his mid-forties who has spent the majority of his adult life loading and unloading ships at one of Aethermoor's major ports. Despite his humble occupation, Tomás has become an invaluable source of information about shipping schedules, cargo contents, and the various personalities who frequent the docks. His keen observational skills and natural curiosity have made him privy to more secrets than most nobles.

What sets Tomás apart from other dock workers is his genuine fascination with the underwater goods that began appearing after contact with Aquabyssos was established. He's developed an unofficial expertise in identifying underwater artifacts and understanding the basic principles of pressure-resistant packaging, making him a go-to person for anyone dealing with inter-realm trade goods.

## Historical Background

Tomás began working the docks as a teenager, following in his father's footsteps after a fishing accident left the family needing steady income. He witnessed the dramatic changes in port operations when trade with Aquabyssos began, adapting quickly to the new types of cargo, specialized handling requirements, and exotic security measures needed for underwater goods.

During the early years of inter-realm trade, Tomás helped develop many of the standard procedures now used for handling pressure-sensitive items and water-logged goods. His practical innovations, born from trial and error, became part of the official dock worker training program, though he rarely receives credit for these contributions.

## Current State

Now a senior dock worker, Tomás serves as an unofficial supervisor and mentor to newer employees. His reputation for reliability and discretion has earned him the trust of various merchants, diplomats, and adventurers who value his insights about dock operations and shipping patterns. He maintains detailed mental records of who ships what and when, making him a valuable intelligence source.

Tomás has recently been expressing concerns about the increasing number of "strange" shipments coming through the port - containers that seem to affect local weather, crates that whisper at night, and packages that dock workers report feeling "watched" by. He's begun keeping an informal log of these incidents.

## Cultural Impact

### Aquabyssos
Underwater merchants and diplomats have come to respect Tomás's expertise with their goods. Several have specifically requested him to handle their most delicate shipments, and he's received honorary recognition from the Aquabyssos Trade Guild for his contributions to inter-realm commerce.
