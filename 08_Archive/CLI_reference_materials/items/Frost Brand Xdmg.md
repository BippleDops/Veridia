In freezing temperatures, the weapon sheds [Bright Light](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) in a 10-foot radius and [Dim Light](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 10 feet.

When you draw this weapon, you can extinguish all nonmagical flames within 30 feet of yourself. Once used, this property can't be used again for 1 hour.
