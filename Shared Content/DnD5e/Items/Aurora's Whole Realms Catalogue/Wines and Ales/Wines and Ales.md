# Wines and Ales
## Overview
Elminster once said, “The heavy wisdom that sorrow teaches is lightened by the pint, and lost by the gallon.” For all the insight in this typically pedantic Elminsterism, I’ve more than once seen the old mage well into his cups. 

Of course most of us rely upon distilled fare not for its deleterious effects, but for the mere quenching of thirst. Unless one dwells in Vaasa, the High Moor, or the glad halls of Evermeet, water consumption has proven consistently dangerous to health, as well as producing what the dwarfs term “sloshtomach.” By contrast, a strong, almost impenetrable ale scours the palate, pleases the stomach, and lightens the head for philosophical debate. 

And what ale does in two swallows, wine does in one. As you will see in the next few pages, I am committed to offering a wide variety of distilled fare, with selections suitable for most any palate and purse. I caution that a wise drinker will engage in philosophy but avoid driving beasts of burden.

## Puchasing Size
Despite Elminster’s fables about some faraway land where even the most common of drinks are sealed and sold in glass bottles, I can offer only those standard containers adopted by vineyards of Faerun. All of the beers, wines, and other products here are to be found in sizes and packages like these:

**Hand keg:** 12" long and 8" in circumference, the hand keg weighs about 10 pounds and carries roughly 2 gallons of liquid.

**Cask:** This small barrel is roughly 2' long and 18" in circumference, casks carry 12 gallons of wine or beer.

**Barrel:** Generally 3-5' long and as wide around as a healthy man’s shoulders, barrels are the most common container for transporting liquids. Barrels hold 30 gallons.

**Butt:** 100 gallon butts are roughly 6-7' long and wider than a man, a standard purchase size for well-to-do manors, estates, and small castles.

**Tun:** Generally mounted into the wall of taverns with a tap directly into it, a tun holds 250 gallons.
