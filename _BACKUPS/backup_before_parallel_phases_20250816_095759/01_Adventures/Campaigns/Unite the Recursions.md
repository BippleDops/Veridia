--- # Unite the Recursions *The ultimate quest to merge all recursive realities into one stable existence* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview "Unite the Recursions" refers to both an ancient prophecy and an active quest to resolve the fundamental instability of Aquabyssos's reality. The underwater realm exists not as a single timeline but as an infinite recursion of possibilities, each iteration slightly different, all existing simultaneously in the same space. This recursive nature is both Aquabyssos's greatest strength—making it impossible to truly destroy—and its fatal weakness—threatening to collapse into paradox at any moment. The quest to unite the recursions attempteded seventeen times throughout history. Each attempt has failed, creating more recursions rather than fewer. Yet the prophecy insists that the eighteenth attempt will either succeed in creating a single, stable reality, or destroy all versions of Aquabyssos across every possible timeline. However, ### Understanding Recursive Reality Aquabyssos exists in a state of quantum superposition:

- Every possible version exists simultaneously
- Choices create new recursions rather than replacing old ones
- Dead people are alive in adjacent recursions
- The same space contains multiple contradictory truths
- Time loops back on itself infinitely ### The Recursion Types **Primary Recursions** (The Seven Core Realities)

**Summary**: The Recursion Types **Primary Recursions** (The Seven Core Realities) - Key information at a glance.

1. **The Drowned World**: Where the surface never existed
2. **The Risen Dream**: Where Aquabyssos rules the surface
3. **The Eternal War**: Where the conflict never ends
4. **The Perfect Peace**: Where harmony was achieved
5. **The Dead Waters**: Where everyone died but continues
6. **The Living Ocean**: Where the water itself is conscious
7. **The Original**: The first Aquabyssos (maybe) **Secondary Recursions** (Variations of the Seven)

- Each primary has millions of variations
- Differ in small but significant details
- Characters may be good or evil
- Events happen in different orders
- Some are temporally reversed **Tertiary Recursions** (Unstable Echoes)
- Temporary realities that fade
- Created by major decisions
- Last days to centuries
- Often paradoxical
- Sometimes become permanent ** Recursions** (Failed Realities)
- Realities that shouldn't exist
- Violate fundamental laws
- Inhabited by impossibilities
- Gradually corrupt other recursions
- Must be pruned or contained ### Recursion Mechanics **Bleed-Through Effects**

- Memories from other recursions leak through
- Objects phase between versions
- People meet alternate selves
- Events happen multiple ways simultaneously
- Reality becomes negotiable **Recursion Sickness**
- Caused by awareness of other versions
- Symptoms include temporal displacement
- Seeing multiple realities at once
- Existential crisis from lost uniqueness
- Physical splitting into variants **Anchor Points**
- Locations stable across all recursions
- Events that happen in every timeline
- People who exist in all versions
- Objects present in every reality
- Concepts universal to all recursions ### The Eighteen Attempts **First Attempt**: The Gathering of Minds

- 3,000 years ago by the Philosopher Kings
- Tried to think all realities into one
- Created the Paradox Academy instead
- Thinkers still debating in recursion loops **Second Attempt**: The Great Convergence
- 2,500 years ago by the Archmage Council
- Used massive ritual magic
- Accidentally created more recursions
- Magic now works differently in each reality **Third through Sixteenth Attempts**: [See Appendix A for details]
- Various methods tried
- All failed uniquely
- Each created new problems
- Some attempts still ongoing in recursions **Seventeenth Attempt**: The Reality Engine
- 50 years ago by the Techno-Theocrats
- Built machine to merge realities
- Machine exists in all recursions now
- Running but effect unknown **Eighteenth Attempt**: The Current Quest
- Prophesied to be the final attempt
- Will either succeed or end everything
- Requires elements from all previous attempts

Party searches for the Universal Key across recursions, discovering it might be a person, idea, or moment rather than an object. **The Diplomat Mission**

Negotiate the Uimous Decision by convincing every version of key individuals across multiple recursions. **The Reality Mappers**

Chart unexplored recursions while avoiding Recursion Purists trying to stop them. **The Paradox Solvers**

Resolve fundamental contradictions between recursions without creating new ones. **The Divine Petitioners**

Seek approval from gods across all realities, including those who hate each other. ### Recursion-Spanning Adventures **The Self Hunt**

Track down and deal with evil versions of the party from other recursions who are sabotaging unification. **The Perfect Crime**

Solve a murder that happened differently in each recursion, with different victims, killers, and motives. **The Recursion War**

Fight in a battle occurring across multiple realities simultaneously with different sides winning in each. **The Identity Crisis**

Party members begin merging with alternate selves, gaining their memories and abilities but losing their identity. **The Final Choice**

Decide whether unification is worth the cost when the party discovers they only exist in some recursions. ### Running Recursion Games **Managing Multiple Realities**:

- Keep core elements consistent
- Change details significantly
- Document differences clearly
- Let players discover variations
- Use recursion for plot twists **Recursion Encounter Table** (d20):

1-3: Meet alternate self
4-6: Object phases between versions
7-9: History changes mid-conversation
10-12: Dead NPC alive here
13-15: Different faction in charge
16-17: Fundamental law different
18-19: recursion intrusion
20: Reality Engine activation **Tracking Recursions**:
- Number or name each one
- Note key differences
- Track party's path
- Monitor bleed-through
- Manage paradoxes ### The Meta Truth The quest to Unite the Recursions is itself recursive. Every campaign that attempts it creates a new recursion where it succeeded or failed. The players' decisions don't determine the outcome—they determine which recursion the campaign continues in. The real question isn't whether to unite the recursions, but whether the party wants to live in a reality where they did. --- ## See Also

- [[The Recursion Nexus *"To Unite the Recursions is to choose one truth from infinite lies, one path from all possibilities, one reality from endless dreams. The question is not can we, but should we, and if we should, which we should do it?"* ## Player-Facing Summary Unite the Recursions is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Unite the Recursions as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Unite the Recursions. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Plot Hooks - A shipment has gone missing and war looms

- An heirloom has gone missing and truth emerges
- Someone is blackmailing a witness for power
- Strange sightings suggest a conspiracy ## Related Notes - [Similar Topic 1]]
