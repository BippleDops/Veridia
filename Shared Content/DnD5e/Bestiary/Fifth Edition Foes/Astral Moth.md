## Description
Astral moths are large, mothlike creatures with the bizarre ability to carry other creatures between planes of existence or into other dimensions.

The origins of these rare creatures are lost in the sands of time, but three varieties are known. The dark and white varieties are both semiintelligent, with the dark-colored moths being Chaotic Neutral in alignment and the white ones being Lawful Neutral. There is also a grey variety which is believed to be closer to the original breeding stock, having only animal intelligence and Neutral alignment. All three varieties are capable of planar travel and of receiving instructions by means of rudimentary telepathy.

Training is essential for an astral moth that is intended for use as a mount, because poorly trained and untrained astral moths may try to throw off a rider mid-journey—a significant hazard in some of the realms astral moths can cross.

The creatures themselves are relatively harmless. The true threat from an astral moth is whatever strange being might be riding it. Astral moths have been used by many lost and forgotten nonhuman civilizations that existed in different times, planes, and dimensions.

They are, of course, greatly prized by wizards. The egg of an astral moth can fetch 5,000 gp from the right buyer. Capturing a wild adult is possible, but care must be taken to keep it from getting airborne: if the creature is able to take wing, it will simply escape into unknown dimensions, possibly dragging its would-be captor along into distant realms with no hope of a safe return.
