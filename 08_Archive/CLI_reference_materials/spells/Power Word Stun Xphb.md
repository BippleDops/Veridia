# Power Word Stun
*8th-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range. If the target has 150 [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] or fewer, it has the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Stunned|Stunned]] condition. Otherwise, its [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb|Speed]] is 0 until the start of your next turn.

The [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Stunned|Stunned]] target makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on itself on a success.
