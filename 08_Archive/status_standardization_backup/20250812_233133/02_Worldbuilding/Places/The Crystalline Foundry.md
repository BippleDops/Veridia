## Secrets and Mysteries

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Dragon's Bargain
> The Crystalline Foundry is actually built around and powered by a sleeping Crystal Dragon named Lumathyst from before the Great Drowning. The dragon made a bargain with the original builders - they could use her power to create wonderful things, but if they ever became corrupt or used their abilities for destruction, she would awaken and reclaim her power. Only Master Thorek knows the full truth.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Failed Experiment
> Thirty years ago, the Foundry attempted to create sentient crystal beings as perfect workers. Several constructs gained true intelligence but disappeared during the Great Fire incident. They may still exist somewhere in the city's underground, possibly organizing other constructs and planning their own agenda for crystal-kind's future.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Hidden Arsenal
> Deep beneath the main complex lies a secret facility where the most dangerous weapons are created. This includes items that could shift the balance of power between kingdoms, weapons commissioned by the royal family for "special purposes," and experimental artifacts too dangerous for normal use. Access requires personal authorization from the Master and the Queen.
