## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The mangler makes two claw attacks.

***Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ( `dice: 1d8+4`) slashing damage. If the attack roll has advantage, the target also takes 7 ( `dice: 2d6`) psychic damage.

***Flurry of Claws (Recharge 4-6).*** The mangler makes six claw attacks against one target. Either before or after these attacks, it can move up to its speed as a bonus action without provoking opportunity attacks.

## Description
A mangler is a low-slung, creeping horror with multiple gangly arms. A mangler most often has six arms, but one can have any number from four to eight. Manglers creep along the ground or the walls, sticking to shadows, hiding in spots that seem too shallow or well-lit to conceal anything. They appear smaller than their true size, thanks to their hunched posture and emaciated frame. Cultists summon these creatures to serve as guards and assassins, two roles at which they excel.
