# Trap #22 - "Rock and Roll River" by Evinrood and the Delvers!
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> In the wall opposite the waterfall is another entrance covered by tightly spaced chains that barely touch the water. If the party has even a shred of sense they will make for this exit at great speed. (I've had great fun betting on which delver will make the exit first, kinda like cockroach races.)
> 
> Once through the chains the tomb robbers may want to turn back. Before them is a narrow tunnel 7 to 10 feet wide, and about twice that in height (half of this filled with very rapidly moving water.) Adding to the trepidation is the fact that the tunnel bends out of sight to the right. (Lights, torches would be nice here!) The speed of the current will preclude any deep thought on the part of the delvers. There are stalactites depending from the ceiling which have a mere 10% chance (L 1) of beaning someone upright in the boat. Their presence will nicely obscure the real traps in this section.
> 
> Evinrood being in this for the long haul, needed a way to keep the narrower parts of his waterway clear of debris, most of which would be biological, so as with the shredding spears earlier he devised a clever slicer here. The Rolling Rocks of Doom are perhaps the most diabolical traps so far rendered. As the party is swept along, both boaters and "floaters", they will encounter water-smoothed rocks that lurk just below the surface. Aside from some bumps and bruises they will not seriously disturb the "floaters", and the boaters will just scrape over them with little ill effect due to the speed of the current. No problem, thinks the delvers. "Hal", says you. The next smooth rock they come to is anything but.
> 
> The upstream side is a smooth rock surface counterweighted so that the smooth side faces upriver. Rushing water will not upset this balance. The impact of a heavy object, like a large dead fish , or a boat load of foolish tomb robbers will cause the balance to tip. Mounted on dwarvish steel axles, the rock portion drops down, out from under the delvers, presenting a broad flat surface to the current of the stream. This will force the other end of the device to swing around, up and over, presenting the party with a rack of parallel scythe-like blades. These blades will flash around and neatly flense your victims into convenient longitudinal slices. The force of the river's motion on the now, ahem, clogged blades will bring the smooth rock face back around and help reset the flenser.
> 
> I suppose if a high enough level character with incredible armour on could see the trap coming, he could roll into a ball, and the scythe blades might just hook him around and under, freeing him on the other side. But this would stretch the bounds of credulity. There is only a 50% chance (L5) that even having heavy armour would help.
> 
> Three skulls are about the best I can go on this one good effort for a janitorial tool.
