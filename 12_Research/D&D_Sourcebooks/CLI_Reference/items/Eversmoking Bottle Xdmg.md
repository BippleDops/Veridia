# Eversmoking Bottle
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/eversmoking-bottle.webp#right)

As a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you can open or close this bottle.

Opening the bottle causes thick smoke to billow out, forming a cloud that fills a 60-foot [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] originating from the bottle. The area within the smoke is [[heavily-obscured-xphb|Heavily Obscured]].

Each minute the bottle remains open, the size of the [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum size of 120 feet.

Closing the bottle causes the cloud to become fixed in place until it disperses after 10 minutes. A strong wind (such as that created by the [[gust-of-wind-xphb|Gust of Wind]] spell) disperses the cloud after 1 minute.
