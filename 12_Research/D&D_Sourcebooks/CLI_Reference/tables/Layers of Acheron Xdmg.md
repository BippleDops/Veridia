**Layers of Acheron**

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Avalas | Spirit soldiers wage endless wars across debris-strewn battlefields. |
| Thuldanin | Pitted, hollow cubes are filled with the cast-off machinery of war. |
| Tintibulus | Jagged blocks tumble in darkness, holding frozen memories sapped by the River Styx and crystallized into fleeting images. |
| Ocanthus | Maelstroms of razor-sharp debris swirl above a mire of black ice. |
