## Description
Though many thieves carry these handy gadgets, most hope never to use them. The earblade is an incredibly keen blade mounted on a spring hinge and resting unobtrusively behind the ear. The earblade’s sole use is to deeply score a nooseline placed over a thief’s head. Thus, when the gibbet block is dropped, the rope will snap and the thief can escape. Since none can guess which side the noose will be placed on, most thieves buy two of these. (1 sp)
