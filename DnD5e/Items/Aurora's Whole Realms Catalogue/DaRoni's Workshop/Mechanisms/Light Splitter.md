### Light Splitter (Pic)

## Description
All creatures of day seek light and fear dark. A gnome on a hill can scare a giant below if his shadow is tall over the giants head. A bird above a clear lake passes a shadow in the bottom as great as the leviathan. Water and glass make shadows big by the way they are shaped, and distance spreads shadows far. 

So I ask myself how to make a machine that makes small shadows big? My light splitter (25 gp) lets [[Candle|candle]] light go through a glass to straighten it, then past a colored glass stencil, then through another glass, then to a wall. Makes the shadow of the stencil upside-down on the wall. The stencil can be cut to look like a man, orc, horse, whatever.

## Additional Details
useful for creating diversion or nonmagical illusion; focuses up to 30 feet away; saves per wood or glass, whichever is worse
