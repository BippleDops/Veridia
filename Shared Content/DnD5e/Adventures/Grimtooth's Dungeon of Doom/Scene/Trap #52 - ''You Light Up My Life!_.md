# Trap #52 - ''You Light Up My Life!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The room that opens before you is brightly lighted. It is 50 feet by 50 feet py 25,just like the "Blue" room before it. The walls are covered with reddish-orange tiles that have a lambent glow. The floor is perforated with small holes out of which are leaping a waving sea of small (1/8th. inch high) blue flames, which flicker and reignite when disturbed, rippling over the floor. At the end of the room there on a bier is a carnelian sarcophagus. At either end of the bier there are columns of dancing flame 9 feet high. The small flames are cool enough to be endurable by anyone wearing thick boots. There is a definite danger if dangling fabrics are present. 
> 
> This would be an excellent place to comment that perhaps the Water Dog and Tsunami Warrior members of the party may wish to retreat. They will take `dice: 1D6` of damage for every turn in this room. They may not regenerate from this damage while in the room. The net result is that this damage will be cumulative. This effect is the same for those mem hers of the party who are bare foot, or shod in metal which will conduct the heat. 
> 
> A close inspection of the sarcophagus shows that has no obvious tricks. It will open with ease to reveal another mummy of a woman, very well preserved and protected exactly like the one in the "Blue" room. (Another vandalism update: even laying the mummy in the flames will have no effect, but give the delvers an "A" for effort.) 
> 
> On this mummy's fingers are 8 rings in the form of long bodied cat creatures. These rings are formed of carnelian with rubies for eyes. Their cash value is over 2,500 g.p. As with the rings in the other room these have a variety of magical spells upon them, and like before some are good and some bad. Keep in mind all will fit, but not over armor. 
> 
> First the good. Two of the rings will give control of elemental creatures known as "Fire Cats". They are made up of flickering licks of flame. They have faces like giant lynxs and bodies the size of cougars. They are capable of `dice: 30D6` of damage. 
> 
> The third ring is the fabled **Ring of Fire**. This ring enables the delver who bears it to burst into flame. This is hard on cloth gannents, and will spoil the temper of a good sword after a time, but will enable the delver to act as a torch without tying up his hands. Blunt or untempered weapons are largely unaffected by the flame and in prolonged use will actually derive some benefit. (Imagine being hit by a red hot mace!) This will add `dice: 3D6` to any unaffected weapon's hit value. If the delver fights in ignited form hand to hand he will generate `dice: 10D6` over his strength value. 
> 
> The fourth ring is The Ring Of The Fire-maker. This ring renders the wearer immune to fire, flame, or intense heat. 
> 
> The last four rings are somewhat less salubrious. The fifth ring causes the bearer to be consumed by the flame (Leaving the ring behind.)
> 
> The sixth ring has the backsticking pin coated with a nerve poison that makes the tomb robber afflicted by it to feel as if his body were on fire. Needless to say this is quite painful and will stop most delvers from being able to do anything but writhe in pain. Again, only a magical cure will help. (Maybe.) 
> 
> The seventh ring injects a hallucinogen that induces a carelessness that nears the state of drunken recklessness. The character will have to exert extraordinary will not to leap into foolish circumstances. There is a 10% chance of the delver who has been jabbed in this fashion behaving in a grossly irresponsible way. An example being if the party goes back to the flour room to search for the trap door. They will leave all flaming devices outside and perhaps be foundering around on the ground. The affected member of the party will say, "We need a light.", and thereupon strike a spark to light a torch. For this poor sod logic will be a constant exercise in will power. 
> 
> The eighth ring will burst into flame itself, burning off the flesh of the fin geron which it is placed. This will be intensely painful, and a member of the party with below average constitution naturally or due to injuries will not survive the shock. The ring cannot be pulled off, and will continue to burn forever, unless the finger is removed. The good news is that the rest of the delvers hand is immune to the firey effects. 
> 
> This ring is a blessing in disguise, for in tomb work it can act as a torch with out tying up a hand. A cautionary note though: don't hand this fellow any scrolls to read. (For that matter think of the effect he will have on any bed he tries to sleep in. Talk about the hazards of smoking in bed!)
> 
> Again the Rings are skull rated from four to two.
> 
> One last note: While Evinrood was known to consort with both these ladies during his checkered career, it was never at the same time for what will become obvious reasons.
> 
> The lady in the Blue Room was the Sorceress of the Inland Sea. She had control of a variety of water based creatures, most notable of whom were her Water Dogs which she would set upon her enemies. It is known that this cool, level-headed lady was the love of Evinrood' s youth. Her fate has passed into the mysteries of the past, but clearly Evinrood has taken steps to look after her remains.
> 
> The other lady was the so-called Goddess of the Fire Ridge. She may have had elemental antecedents. She arrived at the same time as a fiery volcano in the lands that Evinrood knew, bringing with her her wildly unpredictable Fire Cats. This fiery, mercurial woman was the love of Evinrood's majority. Hpr end too is lost in the mists of time, but he likewise took steps to protect her.
> 
> There is a problem that the servants of these two women will pose for the party. Fire Cats and Water Dogs are basically elementals of two mutually antagonistic types. Under the command ofan elemental master they can be made to work together. Under the inept guidance of the delvers the two will rush together in a steam explosion the first time they meet. (A Cat and Dog explosion will have a force of S5D6, and keep in mind there are two of them. Evinrood giveth and Grimtooth taketh away!)
