**Location**: Shadowhaven Docks ## Description

The Dockworkers Union is a powerful and influential union that represents the interests of the dockworkers of Shadowhaven. They are a force to be reckoned with, and they are not afraid to use their power to get what they want. ## Player-Facing Summary Dockworkers Union is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Dockworkers Union as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Dockworkers Union. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - The authorities needs help investigating before the new moon
