# Befuddlement
*8th-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a key ring with no keys)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw.

On a failed save, the target takes `10d12` Psychic damage and can't cast spells or take the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action. At the end of every 30 days, the target repeats the save, ending the effect on a success. The effect can also be ended by the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration-xphb|Greater Restoration]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/heal-xphb|Heal]], or [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish-xphb|Wish]] spell.

On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only.
