# TTRPG Vault Transformation Log

This document summarizes the changes made during the ultra-thorough TTRPG Obsidian vault optimization.

## Phase 1: Deep Research & Analysis

- **Vault Structure Analysis**: Analyzed the existing folder structure, template usage, linking structure, frontmatter properties, and Dataview queries.
- **Content Pattern Recognition**: Identified patterns in session notes, character notes, locations, quests, and other content types.
- **Technical Debt Assessment**: Identified broken links, inconsistent property names, duplicate content, and vestigial folders.

## Phase 2: Research Best Practices

- **Obsidian Bases Migration Research**: Researched the latest features and migration patterns for the Obsidian Bases plugin.
- **Advanced TTRPG Vault Patterns**: Investigated best practices from Joshua Plunkett, PhD20, and Sly Flourish.
- **AI Integration Strategies**: Researched optimal configurations for Text Generator, Smart Connections, and other AI tools.

## Phase 3: Comprehensive Vault Transformation

### 3.1 Structural Reorganization

- Created a new, optimized folder hierarchy.
- Migrated all existing content to the new structure.
- Updated all internal links to reflect the new paths.

### 3.2 Template System Overhaul

- Created new, streamlined templates for sessions, characters, locations, and quests.
- Templates are now Bases-ready, AI-ready, and use Templater for automation.

### 3.3 Database Schema Implementation

- Standardized frontmatter properties across all notes to a consistent schema.

### 3.4 Bases Migration Preparation

- Converted key Dataview queries to Bases-compatible format.
- Created Bases dashboards for active quests, campaign overview, NPC roster, location directory, and session timeline.

### 3.5 AI-Ready Content Structure

- Added AI instruction blocks and prompt templates to the new templates.

### 3.6 Advanced Linking Implementation

- Automatically added bidirectional links to the vault to improve navigation and discoverability.

### 3.7 Automation Scripts

- Created Templater scripts for session prep and post-session cleanup.

## Phase 4: Quality Assurance & Documentation

- **Validation Checks**: Verified that all templates are properly formatted, there are no broken links, and property naming is consistent.
- **Create Operations Manual**: Created a `VAULT_GUIDE.md` file to document the new folder structure and template usage.
