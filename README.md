<details><summary>:grey_question: Welcome to the Obsidian 5e Vault Project</summary>
This is a project for DMs to work together on getting usable data into Obsidian so that we can all run our games more efficiently. Obsidian is a fantastic tool for managing your TTRPG campaigns however for many of us; the idea of having to manually enter the data into the tool is overwhelming and a blocker to getting the most out of the tool. And that is why we are here; to help each other get more out of the tool; share the load and get the most out of Obsidian and the content we own.

<details><summary>:grey_question: A Note On Content</summary>
We are not here to support piracy in any form. We understand that the content we want to use is not available in the format that we want to use it in. We understand that at this point most of us own not one but sometimes 2, 3 or 4 copies of the data that we are using. As such, if you are participating in this project and using the data then we expect you to own the data that you use. If you don't own the data, then delete what you don't own and use what you do own. If you want to use content that you don't own... buy it. Someone has worked hard to create the content, support them so that the hobby can continue to grow.

<details><summary>:grey_question: This Is Fight Club</summary>
First rule about fight club is you don't talk about fight club. We do not want this to become a publicly known project. If we do that, then the leeches will come and they will use this to pirate content they don't own. If the leeches come then we will have no choice but to shut the project down. So don't talk about it. Don't post about it. If you have a close friend who could benefit then let them know the special knock to get through the door but outside of that, this is not a public repository. This is for us to benefit from the work of each other and contribute to each others games in order to lighten the load.

<details><summary>:grey_question: How Can I Use The Content</summary>
Browse through the repository and identity the parts you are interested in using. You can download the whole Vault using [THIS LINK](https://github.com/ObsidianTTRPGProject/ObsidianTTRPGVault/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) or you can download parts of the vault by copying the URL for the folder you want to download into [THIS LINK](https://download-directory.github.io/). 

Once your download has completed simply extract the content into your Obsidian Vault Folder. Images are generally not hosted here and as such you will need to download them seperately. There are seperate Read Me Files within the various folders that contain specific instructions on how to do this.
