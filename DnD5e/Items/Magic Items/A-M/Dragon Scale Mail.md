## Description

Dragon [[Scale Mail|scale mail]] is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes [[14 - Monsters|dragons]] collect their cast-off scales and gift them to [[14 - Monsters|humanoids]]. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon [[Scale Mail|scale mail]] is highly valued.

While wearing this [[2 - Armor|armor]], you gain a +1 bonus to [[2 - Armor|AC]], you have [[2 - Advantage and Disadvantage|advantage]] on [[6 - Saving Throws|saving throws]] against the Frightful Presence and breath [[3 - Weapons|weapons]] of [[14 - Monsters|dragons]], and you have [[17 - Damage and Healing|resistance]] to one damage type that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).

Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the [[2 - Armor|armor]]. This [[3 - Weapons|special]] action canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.
