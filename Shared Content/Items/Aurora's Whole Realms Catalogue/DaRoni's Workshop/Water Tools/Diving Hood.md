## Description
I thought of how the leviathans swim underwater and spout their air above them. I thought if I could breathe my air like they breathe their air I could move underwater too. So I made this diving hood. The top floats on the water and the tube goes down to a mask you wear. It doesnt help you see, but does help you breathe. Best if you put rocks in your pockets and wax in your ears. 25 gp

## Additional Details
allows descent to 20 feet; wearer can move at Â¼ normal movement rate
