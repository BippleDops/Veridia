# Unburn (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a small vial of water)

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
You cast this spell on anything that has been burned within the last 24 hours. It con-jures of a hand-sized black flame that radi-ates cold and shadow, which proceeds to “unburn” the burnt material, taking it back to its pre-fire state. Anyone who touches this flame will take 1 point of cold damage. It will not reverse burn damage to living creatures and will not restore hit points lost to fire damage. If a living creature died due to fire damage, this spell will remove the burns from the corpse, but will not restore the creature to life.

Like normal fire, this black flame spreads and grows, consuming all burnt items until 24 hours have passed or it runs out of burnt material to consume.

If the original fire reduced an object to ashes, and some of those ashes have blown away, then this spell will restore the item with gaps.

Because rust is a form of oxidation, the black flame will reverse the effects of rust, tarnish, and corrosion on metal.
