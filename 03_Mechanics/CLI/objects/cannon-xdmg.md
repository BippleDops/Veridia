# Cannon
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 96*  

A Cannon uses gunpowder or arcane power to propel heavy iron balls at destructive speeds. A Cannon is usually attached to a wooden frame with wheels. Loading a Cannon requires the [Utilize](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Utilize) action, and aiming it requires another [Utilize](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Utilize) action. Then a crew member can take the Cannonball action.
