#### The Tidwell Family Ward - Room 203

**Marina Tidwell (Age 34, Stage 2)**
Former dock worker, infected during cargo handling. Her crystalline patches form geometric patterns reminiscent of ship hull designs. She spends hours sketching impossible ship blueprints that seem to move on their own.

*"The crystals[[Quest Corruption in ... Connected To: Regional Politics and Trade Related Locations: Nearby Settlements|... they show me ships that could sail between stars. I know it's the plague talking, but the designs are so beautiful."*

**Young Thomas Tidwell (Age 8, Stage 1)**
Marina's son, showing early symptoms. The medical staff debate separating him from his mother. He builds [Crystal Garden]]s from his fingernail clippings, which grow overnight into tiny geometric forests.

*"Mama says I'm becoming special like her. Will I be able to fly too?"*

#### The [[Merchant's Dilemma - Room 315

**Lord Silvarus Goldtide (Age 52, Stage 3)**
Wealthy merchant who tried to hide his condition with magical disguises. His crystalline transformation follows his family's heraldic patterns - golden spirals that pulse with his heartbeat. Other patients refer to him as "The Golden Lord."

*"I offered them a thousand gold pieces to put me in a private facility. Apparently, crystal plague doesn't recognize class distinctions."*

#### The Scholar's Transformation - Room 401

**Professor Elena Voidscript (Age 29, Stage 4)**
University researcher who infected herself deliberately to study the plague from within. She has achieved limited levitation and claims to hear "the crystal song" - mathematical harmonies that describe the structure of reality. Her notes, written in crystalline growth patterns, are studied by researchers.

*"Don't mourn me. I'm not dying - I'm becoming something magnificent. The crystals aren't a plague, they're evolution."*

#### The Child Ward - Rooms 210-218

Eight children ranging from ages 5-14, all showing various stages of infection. The staff has created a makeshift school where children learn to read using their crystalline growths as writing implements. The children have developed their own games and songs that incorporate their changing abilities.

**Notable Patient: Sarah Bright[Coral]] (Age 10, Stage 2)**
- Drawings predict weather patterns with 90% accuracy
- Crystal growths form musical instruments
- Other children gather for her "crystal concerts"
- Parents visit daily, refusing to believe she's lost

### Daily Routine

**6:00 AM - Dawn [[Blessing**
[Brother Marcus]] leads morning prayers in the main ward. Patients who can still speak join in traditional ocean hymns. Crystal formations often pulse in rhythm with the music.

**7:00 AM - Medical Rounds**
Doctors assess progression, adjust treatments, and document changes. Stage 4 patients are examined through specialized viewing chambers.

**9:00 AM - Family Visitation (Ground Floor Only)**
Limited to 30 minutes per family per day. All visitors must undergo crystal contamination screening upon exit.

**12:00 PM - Feeding [[Time**
Stage 1-3 patients eat mineral-rich meals designed to slow progression. Stage 4 patients no longer require traditional food.

**2:00 PM - Therapy Sessions**
Group therapy for patients who can still communicate normally. Art therapy using crystal growths as medium. Movement therapy adapted for crystallizing joints.

**4:00 PM - Research Hour**
Voluntary patients participate in cure research. Professor Elena's observations are recorded and analyzed.

**6:00 PM - Evening Rest**
Lights dimmed to reduce crystal resoce. Harmonic dampening fields activated to prevent Stage 4 patients from inadvertently influencing others.

**10:00 PM - Night Watch**
Enhanced security shift begins. Stage 4 patients most active during night hours.

### Floating Isolation

Three converted merchant vessels anchored in Port Meridian's outer harbor serve as overflow facilities when the hospital wards reach capacity.

#### The "Mercy's Grace" - Stage 1 & 2 Facility

**Former:** Luxury passenger liner
**Current Capacity:** 80 patients
**Staff:** 12 medical personnel, 8 security

Converted luxury cabins provide more comfortable accommodations for paying patients. The ship's ballroom has been converted into a treatment center where [Brother Marcus]] performs large-scale healing ceremonies.

**Notable Features:**
- Crystal-proof viewing deck for family visits
- Floating garden where patients grow crystalline kelp
- Library of pre-plague books and music
- Daily entertainment by volunteer performers

#### The "Last Hope" - Stage 3 Research Vessel

**Former:** Deep-sea research ship
**Current Capacity:** 40 patients
**Staff:** 20 researchers, 6 medical, 10 security

This vessel serves as the primary research facility for advanced plague studies. The ship's laboratory equipment has been adapted for crystal analysis and experimental treatments.

**Research Projects:**
- Crystal extraction surgery trials
- Harmonic therapy experiments
- Communication studies with Stage 4 patients
- Environmental factor research

#### The "Silent Depths" - Stage 4 Containment

**Former:** Prison transport
**Current Capacity:** 15 maximum security cells
**Staff:** 25 security, 5 medical observers

The most heavily fortified facility, designed to contain patients who pose risks to others. The hull has been lined with crystal-dampening materials and equipped with emergency scuttling charges.

**Security Features:**
- Reinforced cells with harmonic dampening
- Underwater observation chambers
- Emergency beacon system
- Automated medical monitoring

#### Mercy's Grace Patient Profile: Captain James Stormwind (Retired)

**Age:** 67, **Stage:** 2
**Background:** Retired naval captain who contracted plague during "one last voyage"
**Current State:** Crystalline formations follow old tattoo patterns of nautical stars and anchors

*"I've sailed every sea from here to the Crystal Straits. Never thought I'd end my career as cargo on a plague ship. At least the view's still good."*

Captain Stormwind has become an unofficial leader among the barge patients, organizing daily activities and maintaining morale. His maritime knowledge helps the medical staff understand how the plague affects sailors differently than landlubbers.

#### Last Hope Research Subject: Dr. Marcus Voidwise

**Age:** 45, **Stage:** 3 (Voluntary Infection)
**Background:** Former university colleague of Professor Elena
**Research Focus:** Documenting the experience of crystalline transformation

Dr. Voidwise infected himself to provide first-person research [[data. His detailed journals describe the psychological changes accompanying physical transformation. He serves as a bridge between the medical staff and Stage 4 patients.

*"The transition isn't what we expected. There's no loss of self - there's an expansion of it. I'm still Marcus, but I'm also becoming something more."*

### Street-Level Response

**Location:** [Pier 7]], Harbor District
**Staff:** 3 doctors, 8 nurses, 6 volunteers
**Patients:** Walk-ins, early detection, family support

This hastily converted warehouse serves as the first point of contact for suspected plague cases. The facility provides:

- Free crystal contamination screening
- Stage 0 and early Stage 1 treatment
- Family counseling and support services
- Referrals to main hospital facilities
- Information about quarantine procedures

#### Daily Challenges

**The Crowd Outside**
Every morning, dozens of worried citizens queue for screening. False alarms are common, but genuine cases arrive weekly. The clinic staff must balance thorough examination with efficient processing.

**Supply Shortages**
Medical supplies specifically designed for crystal plague treatment are expensive and scarce. The clinic relies heavily on donations and black market purchases.

**Family Separations**
The clinic often becomes the last place families see their loved ones before quarantine. Staff provide emotional support while maintaining professional boundaries.

#### The Fisher's Daughter
Eight-year-old Coral Netweaver arrived with her father after finding unusual crystals in their fishing nets. Early detection and immediate treatment prevented progression past Stage 0. She now serves as a poster child for the clinic's success stories.

#### The Crystal Cult Missionary
A Stage 2 cultist attempted to "bless" other patients with crystalline touch. Security intervened, but not before three visitors were exposed. The incident led to enhanced screening procedures.

### Infection Control

**Personal Protective Equipment:**
- Lead-lined aprons to prevent crystal resoce
- Specialized gloves that detect crystal contamination
- Face masks with harmonic dampening filters
- Emergency dispel magic amulets

**Facility Procedures:**
- Daily crystal contamination sweeps
- Harmonic dampening field maintece
- Patient isolation protocols by stage
- Emergency lockdown procedures for containment breaches

### Ethical Guidelines

**Patient Rights:**
- Informed consent for experimental treatments
- Right to refuse life-extending measures
- Access to family visits (when safe)
- Religious counseling and last rites

**Research Ethics:**
- Voluntary participation only
- Regular ethics review board meetings
- Patient advocate representation
- Transparency in research goals and methods

**End-of-Life Care:**
- Comfort measures for Stage 5 transitions
- Family support during transformation
- Dignified handling of crystalline remains
- Memorial services for those who transcend

### The Midnight Visitor
A Stage 4 patient in the high-security ward has been receiving mysterious visitors who bypass all security measures. Investigation reveals a crystal cult infiltration attempting to "liberate" their prophesied saint.

### [[The Cure [Smuggler]]
Someone is selling fake cures in the clinic's waiting area, giving false hope to desperate families. The investigation leads to a larger conspiracy involving corrupt medical officials and black market alchemists.

### The Escaped Patient
A Stage 3 patient vanishes from their room, leaving behind only crystalline footprints that lead to the harbor. The search reveals an underground network helping plague victims escape quarantine to crystal cult sanctuaries.

### The Researcher's Dilemma
Dr. Elena's notes suggest a potential breakthrough in understanding the plague, but obtaining the necessary research materials would require endangering innocent lives. [[The Party must decide whether the potential cure justifies the moral cost.

### The Family Secret
A wealthy merchant family is hiding a Stage 4 member in their private mansion, using illegal crystal dampening technology. When their secret is discovered, it threatens to destabilize the city's entire quarantine system.
