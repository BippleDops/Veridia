# Spectral Tendrils
## Overview
*Magical trap*
This 20-foot-square area has been cursed with a ritual that forms tendrils of pure necrotic energy that hunger to feed on the living. The ritual is powered by an unholy symbol painted or carved into the ground at the center of the area. The tendrils live below the surface of the floor and wait for a living creature to walk into the area before attacking.

A character notices the trapped area and its immediate surroundings are slightly colder with a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. A character trained in Religion can determine the meaning of the symbol with a DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check.

When a creature steps into the area, the tendrils rise from the ground and make an attack roll against that creature with a +8 bonus. On a hit the tendrils deal 22 (4d10) necrotic damage and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). While grappled in this way the target is also restrained. The tendrils make new attacks at the start of each round against any creature in the area.

Dealing 15 damage to the tendrils grasping a creature with a single attack or spell causes the arms to let go of that creature (AC 15). Dealing any radiant damage to the tendrils causes them to disappear.
