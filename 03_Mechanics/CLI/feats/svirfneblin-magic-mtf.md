# Svirfneblin Magic

**Prerequisite**: [Gnome (Deep)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/races/gnome-deep-mtf.md)

You have inherited the innate spellcasting ability of your ancestors. This ability allows you to cast [nondetection](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/nondetection-xphb.md) on yourself at will, without needing a material component. You can also cast each of the following spells once with this ability: [blindness/deafness](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/blindness-deafness-xphb.md), [blur](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/blur-xphb.md), and [disguise self](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self-xphb.md). You regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish a long rest.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you cast them at their lowest possible levels.
