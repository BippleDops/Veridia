## Overview
Archon Meredith Saltweaver rules [[New Tethys]] and the [[Tethyan Hegemony]] with an iron fist wrapped in silk. A master politician and powerful hydromancer, she maintains her position through careful manipulation, strategic alliances, and rumored dark pacts. She appears as a regal woman in her 50s, though magic keeps her looking younger. Her skin has a blue-green tint from partial adaptation, and her eyes glow with an unsettling cerulean light.

## History
Born to merchant family before the drowning's completion, Meredith witnessed the final transformations of the surface world. She maneuvered through the chaos to seize power, supposedly making a deal with something in [[The Cerulean Trench]] for the strength to rule. Has ruled New Tethys for 47 years.
