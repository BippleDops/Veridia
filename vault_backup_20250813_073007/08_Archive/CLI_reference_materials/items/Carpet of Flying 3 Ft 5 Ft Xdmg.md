# Carpet of Flying, 3 ft. × 5 ft.
*Wondrous item, very rare*  



You can make this carpet hover and fly by taking a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action and using the carpet's command word. It moves according to your directions if you are within 30 feet of it.

A 3 ft. × 5 ft. carpet can carry up to 200 lb. at a fly speed of 80 feet. A carpet can carry up to twice the weight shown on the table, but its [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/fly-speed-xphb|Fly Speed]] is halved if it carries more than its normal capacity.
