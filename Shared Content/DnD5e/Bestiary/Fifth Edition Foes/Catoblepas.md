## Special Traits
**Stunning Ugliness:** The catoblepas is so shockingly ugly that just glimpsing one can blind the viewer. Characters fighting a catoblepas must either either avert their eyes and take tactical disadvantage on attack rolls against the catoblepas, or make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw before making their attack roll. Failure on the saving throw means the character is blinded until the start of his or her next turn. Anyone who rolls a lower initiative result than the catoblepas must attempt this saving throw immediately at the beginning of combat.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The catoblepas attacks with its tail and uses its rancid breath (if available).

**Tail Sweep:*** Melee Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 15 ft., up to 3 creatures in a 10 ft. square. Hit: 8 (`dice: 1d10+3`) bludgeoning damage and the target is knocked prone. Rancid Breath (Recharge 5-6): automatic hit, 60 ft. cone, creatures in the cone. Hit: creatures in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against poison or be stunned. Stunned creatures can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, recovering with a successful save. If a creature that is currently stunned by the catoblepas's breath is stunned again by a second rancid breath attack, that creature immediately drops to 0 hit points.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Swamps

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, or herd (3–6)

## Description
The catoblepas is loathsome beyond description, with no positive qualities whatsoever. It resembles a bloated hippopotamus with a long, whiplike tail and a snakelike neck topped with the oversized head of a diseased warthog with bloodshot eyes. For all its ungainliness, its tail is tremendously quick and accurate when whipping around to strike at enemies anywhere near the creature.

The deadliest weapon of the catoblepas, however, is its rancid breath, which can leave creatures helplessly gasping for air, or even kill with too large a dose. Fortunately, its metabolism is so slow that it exhales only infrequently.

Catoblepases live only in swamps, and the more fetid, the better. They are territorial, ill-tempered, and aggressive when encountered, but they spend most of their time slumbering, digging for roots, or hunting for small prey or fish in shallow water. On those rare occasions when they venture to the edges of their fens, they’ve been known to devastate entire villages simply by standing at the outskirts and letting their rancid breath waft through town.
