## Special Traits
**Duplicate (1/Day):** As an action, a tangtal creates `dice: 2d4` images of itself. The images can move up to 30 feet away from the tangtal, but each must stay within 10 feet of at least one other image. Images have the same AC and speed as the tangtal and 1 hit point apiece; an image disappears when it takes any damage. An image can be damaged only by an attack that targets and damages it specifically; images arent affected by area attacks or nondamaging effects. An attack that targets the tangtal has a chance to hit an image instead, in exact proportion to the number of images; e.g., if there are six images, an attack against the tangtal has a 1-in-7 chance to hit it and a 6-in-7 chance to hit an image.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A tangtal bites once and attacks once with claws.

**Claws:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d8+3`) slashing damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate forests and plains

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
Tangtals, or dupli-cats, have the appearance and ferocity of normal panthers, but they are far more intelligent and they have a magical ability to project illusory images of themselves. They roam haunted woodlands or plains, but also often lair near civilized areas.

Tangtals are solitary creatures; no recorded encounter has ever been with more than one of these creatures. Tangtal young are unknown; none have ever been killed, captured, or even seen.

Tangtals are carnivores that prefer to dine on rabbits, squirrels, grouse, and other small game. When food is scarce, it is not unheard of for a tangtal to sneak into a civilized area and carry off chickens, sheep, calves, dogs, cats, and even children.

A tangtal is about 7 feet long from nose to tail and weighs 350 to 400 pounds.

Tangtals are ferocious on the attack, but they are also smart enough to know when a fight is lost. If combat goes against one, it flees, usually while it still has images remaining to distract the enemy.
