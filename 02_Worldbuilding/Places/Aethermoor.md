# Aethermoor
*The Shattered Crown Continent*

## Overview
Aethermoor is a continent forever changed by the Great Crystallization, an event 500 years ago when massive spires of crystallized magic erupted from the earth. These Aether Crystals grant incredible magical power but come with a terrible price - prolonged exposure causes crystalline corruption, slowly transforming living beings into crystal themselves.

## Geography

### Major Regions

**[[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Crystalline Wastes]]** - Northern wasteland where crystal growth is uncontrolled
*Sensory Environment*: A barren landscape where reality itself feels unstable. Air shimmers with uncontrolled magical energy, creating visual distortions and phantom sounds. Temperature fluctuates wildly as crystal formations absorb and release energy unpredictably. The ground crunches underfoot with crystal fragments, while the horizon warps through prismatic effects. Abandoned settlements stand as crystalline monuments to the dangers of uncontrolled growth.

**[[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Lumengarde]]** - Central kingdom, center of crystal technology
*Sensory Environment*: The heartland of crystal civilization, where controlled magical energy creates an atmosphere of organized power. Cities hum with harmonious crystal resonance, while countryside farming utilizes crystal-enhanced agriculture. The air tastes of progress and innovation, while roads paved with crystal fragments provide natural lighting for night travel. Architecture blends seamlessly with integrated crystal formations.

**[[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Verdant Reach]]** - Southern forests resisting crystal expansion
*Sensory Environment*: Ancient forests where natural magic conflicts with crystal intrusion. Air carries the complex scents of old growth trees, wild flowers, and the ozone of magical resistance. Crystal formations here grow reluctantly, often twisted into organic shapes by the forest's influence. Sounds range from natural forest ambiance to the subtle chiming of crystal-wood hybrid trees. Temperature remains moderated by natural climate systems.

**[[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Sundered Peaks]]** - Eastern mountain range, source of purest crystals
*Sensory Environment*: Majestic mountain peaks where crystal formations grow in their most spectacular forms. Thin air carries the sharp scent of snow and crystal ozone, while echoes multiply through crystal cave systems. Temperature varies dramatically with altitude and crystal activity. Underground crystal formations create natural amphitheaters where sound behaves in impossible ways.

**[[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Azure Coast]]** - Western trading ports and naval power
*Sensory Environment*: Where sea meets crystal-enhanced civilization. Salt air mixes with crystal ozone, creating unique atmospheric conditions. Harbor cities showcase the marriage of traditional maritime culture with crystal technology. Ship horns enhanced by crystal resonance can be heard for leagues, while lighthouse crystals provide navigation beacons visible from great distances. Sea spray carries traces of crystal energy from ships.

**[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Whispering Expanse|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Whispering Expanse]]** - Mysterious desert where crystals sing
*Sensory Environment*: A vast desert where crystal formations create natural wind instruments. During the day, heat causes crystal expansion that produces subtle musical tones. Night brings cooling contractions that create entirely different harmonic compositions. Sand carries crystal dust that creates sparkling effects in sunlight and makes walking feel like moving through glitter. Navigation requires following crystal-song patterns rather than traditional landmarks.

**[[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Shadowmere]]** - Corrupted swamplands in the southeast
*Sensory Environment*: A dark region where crystal corruption has created an environment of decay and danger. Air tastes bitter and metallic, while water carries an oily sheen that rejects natural purification. Corrupted crystal formations create unnatural lighting that hurts to look at directly. Sounds become muffled and distorted, while temperature drops unnaturally despite the warm climate. Plants and animals show signs of crystal mutation.

### Major Cities
- **[[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven]]** - Capital of Lumengarde, the Crystal Throne
- **[[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]]** - Largest trading hub on the Azure Coast
- **[[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Ironhold]]** - Dwarven stronghold in the Sundered Peaks
- **[[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Sylvanheart]]** - Elven sanctuary in the Verdant Reach

## History

### The Three Epochs

#### The Age of the Crown (Before Great Crystallization)
When the God-King Aetheron ruled with the Crown of Stars, maintaining perfect order through divine mandate.

#### The Shattering (500 years ago)
[[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Crystallization]] - Aetheron was betrayed by his seven advisors. The Crown of Stars shattered, its fragments piercing the earth and emerging as Aether Crystals. This event is detailed in [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Shattering of the Crown]].

#### The Crystal Age (Present)
Five centuries of adaptation to crystal magic. The rise of the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/People/Crystal Wardens]], the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Purist Coalition]], and other factions vying for control.

## Player-Facing Summary

Aethermoor is a sky-borne element of the setting, known for brass fittings and cloudstone terraces. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Aethermoor as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Aethermoor.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
