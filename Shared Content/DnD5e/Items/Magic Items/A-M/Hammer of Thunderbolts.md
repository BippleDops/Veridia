## Description
You gain a +1 bonus to [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] and damage rolls made with this [[Magic Weapon|magic weapon]].

***Giantâ€™s Bane*** ***(Requires Attunement).*** You must be wearing a [[Belt of Giant Strength|belt of giant strength]]** (any variety) and [[Gauntlets of Ogre Power|gauntlets of ogre power]]** to attune to this weapon. The attunement ends if you take off either of those items. While you are attuned to this weapon and holding it, your [[Strength|Strength]] score increases by 4 and can exceed 20, but not 30. When you roll a 20 on an [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] roll made with this weapon against a giant, the giant must succeed on a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 17 [[Constitution|Constitution]] saving throw or die.

The hammer also has 5 charges. While attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] with the hammer, hurling it as if it had the Thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the hammer unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 17 [[Constitution|Constitution]] saving throw or be [[Stunned|stunned]] until the end of your next turn. The hammer regains `dice: 1d4+1` (1d4+1) expended charges daily at dawn.

**Heavy.** Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

**Two-Handed.** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
