## Special Traits

**Aura of Desecration:** All undead within 20 feet of a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadaver]] lord gain tactical advantage against attempts to turn undead.

**Cadaver Fever:** At the end of a battle against [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadavers]], anyone who was clawed or bitten by a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadaver]] must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against disease. Failure indicates the character is infected with [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadaver]] fever. An infected character gains one level of exhaustion immediately and must repeat the saving throw at the end of every long rest. Each failed saving throw adds one more level of exhaustion; a successful saving throw at the end of a long rest means only that the character's condition doesn't worsen. The character recovers fully when he or she makes successful saving throws at the ends of two consecutive long rests or when lesser restoration or comparable magic is used on the character.

**Create Spawn:** A creature slain by a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadaver]] lord rises in `dice: 1d4` minutes as a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadaver]] under the control of the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadaver]] lord.

**Reanimation:** When reduced to 0 hit points, a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadaver]] is not destroyed; rather it falls inert and begins regaining 1 hit point per round. Hit points lost to magical weapons or spells are not regained. When the creature reaches its full hit point total (minus damage dealt by magical attacks and weapons), it reassembles itself and stands up, ready to fight again. Scattering or even destroying the pieces of its body don't prevent it from magically reassembling and reanimating. If gentle repose is cast on the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadaver]] when it is at 0 hit points, it can't reanimate. A bless spell delays the reanimation, causing the creature to regain 1 hit point per minute instead of per round.

**Spell-like Abilities:** The [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadaver]] lord can use the following spell-like abilities, using Charisma as its casting ability (DC 12, attack +4). The cadaver lord requires no material components to use these abilities.

- 1/day: *darkness, fear*

**Summon Undead (1/Day):** Once per day as an action, a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadaver]] lord can summon five [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadavers]]. They arrive in `dice: 1d6` rounds (shambling from nearby chambers, digging up from their shallow graves, etc.), and are under the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadaver]] lord's control.

## Actions

**Multiattack:** The [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadaver]] lord bites once and attacks once with claws.

**Bite:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (`dice: 1d8+3`) piercing damage and the target may be infected with [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadaver]] fever (see above).

**Claw:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (`dice: 3d6+3`) slashing damage and the target may be infected with [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadaver]] fever (see above).

## Ecology

**Environment**: Any

**Organization**: Solitary or troupe ([[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadaver]] lord plus 1â€“4 [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadavers]])

## Description

[[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|Cadaver]] lords are rare examples of [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadavers]] that arose from creatures that were uncommonly powerful in life, making them extremely dangerous opponents. They are stronger, tougher, and more intelligent than the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver|cadavers]] they command. They are rarely encountered by chance and rarely encountered alone. Most maintain a lair far away from civilization where they plot and plan, sending their minions on missions to further their goals.
