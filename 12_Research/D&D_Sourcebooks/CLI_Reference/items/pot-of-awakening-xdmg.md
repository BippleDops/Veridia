# Pot of Awakening
*Wondrous item, common*  



If you plant an ordinary shrub in this 10-pound clay pot and let it grow for 30 days, the shrub magically transforms into an [[awakened-shrub-xmm|Awakened Shrub]] at the end of that time. When the shrub awakens, its roots break the pot, destroying it.

The awakened shrub is [[friendly-attitude-xphb|Friendly]] toward you and obeys your commands. Absent commands from you, it does nothing.
