# 1361 - Invasion of Shilmista Forest
## Overview
**Date**: Friday, 2 January 1361 12:00:00 AM

Led by the ogrillon fighter Ragnor, an army of [[Orc|orcs]] and other monstrous humanoids from Castle Trinity invaded the elven kingdom of Shilmista Forest. Ragnorâ€™s forces inflicted substantial damage on the elves, but the forest people were later able to kill the ogrillon and defeat his followers with the help of Cadderly Bonaduce and a group of his [[Friends|friends]], including Danica Maupoissant and Ivan and Pikel Bouldershoulder. During the war, Galladel, the king of Shilmista Forest, was slain and his son, Elbereth, was named the new ruler of the elven nation.
