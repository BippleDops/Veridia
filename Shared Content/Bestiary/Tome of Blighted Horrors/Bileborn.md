# Bileborn
## Overview
### Bileborn
![[1setnvzr.nqb.png|Bileborn|300]]
[[1setnvzr.nqb.png|open outside]]

*T**his revolting creature appears to be formed of a tangle of limbs and pieces of rotting corpses that splay in all directions like some kind of demented sea urchin. The many appendages flail spastically as it moves with a disturbing, rolling motion. Barely discernible amid this tangle are a number of severed, rotting heads, their eyes open and watching, their lips wordlessly mouthing unheard imprecations*.

## Special Traits
**Coordinated Burst (1/day):** As a bonus action, the bileborn synchronizes its flailing motion. Its speed increases to 60 feet, and it can make 8 slam attacks on its turn. This effect lasts until the end of the bileborn’s current turn.

**Many Arms:** Creatures have tactical disadvantage on attempts to escape from the bileborn’s grapple.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The bileborn makes four melee attacks, using any combination of Slam and Absorb. It can use its Babbling Scream in place of two melee attacks.

**Melee Attack—Slam:** +7 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d8 + 4` bludgeoning damage. If two or more slam attacks hit the same creature in the bileborn’s turn, the creature is grappled (escape DC 14).

**Melee Attack—Absorb:** +7 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature already grappled by the bileborn). Hit: `dice: 2d6 + 4` piercing damage, and the creature is pulled into the bileborn’s space and absorbed into the monster’s body. An absorbed creature is blinded and restrained, and it takes `dice: 2d6 + 4` piercing damage at the start of the bileborn’s turn. One Medium creature or two Small creatures can be inside the bileborn at one time. An absorbed creature is unaffected by anything happening outside the bileborn or by attacks from outside it. An absorbed creature can escape from the bileborn’s body by using an action to make a successful DC 14 Str (Athletics) check, or it can get out after the bileborn’s death by using 5 feet of movement.

**Area Attack—Babbling Scream (recharge 5-6):** The bileborn screams in incoherent babbles. All creatures within 60 feet that hear it must make a successful DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be confused (as the confusion spell) for `dice: 1d4` rounds.

## Description
**Environment**: Any land

**Organization**: Solitary

The bileborn is an undead creature born of alchemical and necromantic experimentation. Its purpose and the identity of its creator are unknown, but the mistakes of this master have long since been paid for, as the original bileborn ultimately escaped and slew its creator, incorporating his body among the rest.

A bileborn seeks to increase its mass by absorbing creatures into its body. This does not increase the creature’s size or change it in any fundamental way, but the crowd of body parts grows denser at its center. Then at some indeterminate point, the creature reproduces by fission. The fused conglomeration of rotten body parts splits down the middle, forming two bileborns of equal size and power. These instinctively avoid each other as they go their own ways in search of victims to absorb.

These creatures are little more than horrid masses of dismembered and absorbed victims that somehow work in necromantic coordination and demonstrate considerable stealth and surprising speed for their size and composition. Despite their chaotic and jumbled appearances, their fleshy mass is physically tough, quickly using the dismembered parts of its interior to switch out damaged limbs on it exterior. The bulk of its absorbed brain tissue resides within the severed heads of the central mass of the creature, allowing it to function in a rational manner, though its purpose and goals are likely to be inscrutable to living, sane creatures.
