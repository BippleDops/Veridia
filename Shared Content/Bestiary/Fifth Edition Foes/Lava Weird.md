## Special Traits
**Control Elemental:** Lava weirds have the ability to dominate elementals of the earth or fire type. When the lava weird uses an action to issue a command to an elemental within 50 feet, the elemental must make a successful DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be dominated. The effect is permanent, but the elemental is allowed to repeat the saving throw if it is commanded to do something that will clearly result in its own destruction. An elemental that makes a successful save is not dominated and is immune to this effect for 24 hours. Theres no limit to the number of elementals a lava weird can control. Once domination is established, it has no range limitation, provided the lava weird and the elemental remain on the same plane of existence. Lava weirds are immune to this effect.

**Lava Pool:** A creature thats dragged into a lava pool (or that falls in, or winds up in lava for any reason at all) is restrained and takes 9 (`dice: 2d8`) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. To escape from the lava, the creature or an adjacent ally must use an action and make a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. If the check succeeds, the creature moves 5 feet out of the lava pool, is prone, and is on fire. While on fire, the creature takes 4 (`dice: 1d8`) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The fire is extinguished automatically when the creature or an adjacent ally spends an action to put it out.

**Reform:** When reduced to 0 hit points, a lava weird dissolves into its lava pool. One minute later, it reforms with full hit points minus any hit points it lost to cold damage in the preceding 24 hours.

**Camouflage:** Until it attacks, a lava weird in its lava pool is treated as invisible.

## Actions
**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: 11 (`dice: 2d8+2`) fire damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. A grappled creature takes 6 (`dice: 1d8+2`) fire damage at the start of its turn. If the save succeeds, the target is not grappled but it does catch fire if it is wearing or carrying combustible material or is itself flammable. While the fire burns, the creature takes 4 (`dice: 1d8`) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. The fire is extinguished automatically when the creature or an adjacent ally spends an action to put it out.

**Drag Into Lava:** *Melee Attack:* automatic hit, one creature grappled by the lava weird. Hit: the lava weird and the grappled creature engage in a Strength (Athletics) contest. If the lava weird wins, the grappled creature is dragged into the lava pool; see Lava Pool above.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Elemental Plane of Fire, Plane of Molten Skies

**Organization**: Solitary, pack (2â€“5)

## Description
Weirds are creatures from the elemental planes. They are sometimes encountered on the Material Plane, often in the employ of a powerful spellcaster. They are much more intelligent than typical elementals, however, and they do not take kindly to deception or forced servitude, so summoning these creatures against their will is a risky undertaking. Even so, their ability to command elementals is legendary and highly useful to anyone who has a need for an army of such beings.

Weirds speak the elemental languages of earth and fire. Those that spend time on the Material Plane usually pick up enough words of Common to engage in simple conversations.

Lava weirds have serpentine bodies about 10 feet long formed of elemental magma. No matter what plane they reside on, they spend their time swimming in pools of molten rock and liquid fire. On the Material Plane, they are only found in active volcanoes and other sources of magma. The air of the Material Plane is painfully cold to them, so they never leave their lava pools willingly or for very long. Anyone who hopes to employ these creatures as guards or as elemental commanders must provide them with lava pools to swim in. Because their range of control over elementals is unlimited, they can control any number of them from the safety of their lava pools in a remote volcano while the elementals wreak havoc halfway across the world.

A lava weird hides in its bubbling lava pool, where it is effectively invisible, until enemies come within range. Once a target is within reach, the weird lashes out. If it can, it will pull an intruder into the lava pool and let the molten rock do most of its dirty work. Being of a naturally vicious and malign nature, lava weirds are prone to attack just about any creature that wanders too close to their pools.
