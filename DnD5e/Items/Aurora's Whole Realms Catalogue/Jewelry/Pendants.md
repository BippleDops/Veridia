## Description
I am pleased to offer three styles of pendants, each with its own peculiar attraction. From Shou Lung comes a carnelian dragon’s head, depending from a black braided silk cord. Anauroch brings us a hammered silver disk, pierced around the edges and decorated with tiny bells that tinkle with every movement. Enameled blossoms strung with small amber cylinders are Calimshan’s entry into this offering. *Specify Dragon, Disk*, or *Blossoms* when ordering. Pendant: 45 gp.
