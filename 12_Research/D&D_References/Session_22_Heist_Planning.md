# Session 22: Heist Planning
## The Crystal Vault Infiltration

### Mission Brief
**Target:** Royal Crystal Vault, Sky Palace  
**Objective:** Steal the Shard of Heights before Shadow Conspiracy  
**Timeline:** 3 days to plan, 1 night to execute  
**Stakes:** Prevent cosmic artifact from enemy control  

### Planning Phase (2 hours)

#### Intelligence Gathering
**Serafina's Reconnaissance:**
- Mapped guard rotations and shift changes
- Identified pressure sensors and alarm crystals
- Located service entrances and maintenance shafts
- Discovered guard weaknesses and corruption

**Kestra's Social Intelligence:**
- Attended palace social events as entertainer
- Gathered information on vault access protocols
- Identified sympathetic staff members
- Learned about upcoming security changes

**Marcus's Environmental Assessment:**
- Studied wind patterns around palace
- Identified natural approach routes
- Analyzed structural weak points
- Planned escape routes through sky currents

#### The Plan: "Operation Sky Fall"

**Phase 1 - Distraction (Kestra & Lyralei)**
- Grand performance at palace reception
- Lyralei creates "weather malfunction" requiring evacuation
- Guards respond to apparent atmospheric crisis
- Security focus shifts away from vault

**Phase 2 - Infiltration (Serafina & Marcus)**
- Enter through maintenance shaft during chaos
- Navigate internal security using Serafina's knowledge
- Marcus guides through pressure-sensitive passages
- Reach vault during peak distraction

**Phase 3 - Acquisition (Thane)**
- Use reality anchoring to bypass magical defenses
- Careful extraction without triggering alarms
- Secure Shard in specially prepared container
- Signal team for extraction

**Phase 4 - Escape (Team)**
- Rendezvous at predetermined sky dock
- Escape via "borrowed" palace wind rider
- Lyralei provides storm cover for pursuit evasion
- Emergency backup plans for multiple scenarios

### Execution Session (2.5 hours)

- **Lyralei's Weather:** Created perfect chaos without harm

- **Marcus's Quick Thinking:** Alternative escape route
- **Kestra's Adaptation:** Extended performance to buy time
