# Hew
*Weapon ([battleaxe](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/battleaxe-xphb.md))*  


- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d8 slashing
  - Two-handed: 1d10 slashing
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This +1 battleaxe deals maximum damage when the wielder hits a plant creature or an object made of wood. The axe's creator was a dwarf smith who feuded with the dryads of a forest where he cut firewood. Whoever carries the axe feels uneasy whenever he or she travels through a forest.
