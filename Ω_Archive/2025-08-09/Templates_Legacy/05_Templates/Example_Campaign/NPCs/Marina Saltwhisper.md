## AI-Generated Description

### Physical Appearance
Marina Saltwhisper stands at a middling height with a lean, wiry build that speaks of years spent working the docks. Her ocean-green eyes, a distinctive trait of her elven heritage, are always alert beneath her silver-streaked auburn hair, which she usually keeps tied in a loose bun. Her skin, tanned and weathered from the sea breeze, is adorned with a few faded tattoos of seafaring symbols and oceanic creatures.

### Personality Quirks and Mannerisms
Marina is a keen observer, often found quietly surveying her bustling tavern from behind the counter. She has a habit of absently twisting a silver ring on her finger, a memento from her seafaring days. Despite her reserved demeanor, she's always ready to lend a hand to those in need, though she prefers to do so discreetly, often through subtle hints or covert aid.

### How She Speaks and Interacts
Marina's voice carries a soothing lilt, a lingering trace of her elven lineage, but her words are often colored with the coarse slang of the docks. She is polite, yet reserved, often choosing to listen more than she speaks. Her advice, when given, is dispensed in cryptic, roundabout ways, leaving others to decipher her true intentions.

### The Secret She's Hiding
Unbeknownst to most, Marina is a former pirate who left her life on the high seas after a near-death experience. The silver ring she constantly fiddles with is actually a key to a hidden stash of pirate treasure, a final remnant of her past life.

## Quest Hook: The Pirate Problem

When a notorious pirate gang starts causing trouble at the Shadowhaven Docks, Marina might subtly steer adventurers towards the problem. Her past connections and knowledge of pirate tactics could prove invaluable in dealing with the threat, but she would only reveal this information if she believes the adventurers can be trusted. If they prove their worth, she might even provide them with the key to her hidden stash, offering it as a potential reward for their assistance.

## Tavern: The Whispering Tide

Marina runs a popular tavern near the docks called "The Whispering Tide" where:
- **Dock workers** gather after long shifts
- **Sailors** share tales from distant ports
- **Information** flows as freely as the ale
- **Secrets** are traded in shadowy corners

### Daily Routine
**Dawn-Morning**: Preparing the tavern, receiving deliveries, quiet preparation
**Midday**: Serving lunch to dock workers, listening to gossip and news
**Evening**: Peak hours with sailors, merchants, and travelers sharing stories
**Night**: Closing time cleanup, but often stays late for "special" customers

## Roleplay Notes
