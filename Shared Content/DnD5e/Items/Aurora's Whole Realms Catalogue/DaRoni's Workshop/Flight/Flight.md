# Flight
## Overview
All people everywhere dream to fly, except maybe dwarfs, but they may not dream at all. So I studied the flight of birds to learn what they do to fly so nice. I looked too at the clouds and [[Winds|winds]] and storms to see what makes them move in the sky. What I come up with is here and I swear all of them work some, if the flyer practices.
