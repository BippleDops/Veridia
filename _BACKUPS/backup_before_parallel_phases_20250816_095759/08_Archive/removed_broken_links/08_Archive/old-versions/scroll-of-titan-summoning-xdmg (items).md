*Scroll, legendary* When you take a [[actions#Magic|Magic action to read this scroll, a particular titan named in the scroll appears in an unoccupied space on the ground or in water that you can see within 1 mile of yourself. The DM picks a suitable titan or determines it randomly by rolling on the table below. The titan is [Hostile Attitude Xphb]] toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]]. If the titan is summoned into a space that isn't large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted.`dice: [](scroll-of-titan-summoning-xdmg.md#^1-titan)`| dice: `dice: 1d100` | Titan |
