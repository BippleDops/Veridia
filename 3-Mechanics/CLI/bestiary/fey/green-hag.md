"traits":
- "desc": "The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She\
    \ can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:\n\n\
    At will: [dancing lights](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/dancing-lights.md), [minor\
    \ illusion](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/minor-illusion.md), [vicious mockery](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/vicious-mockery.md)"
  "name": "innate"
- "desc": "The hag can breathe air and water."
  "name": "Amphibious"
- "desc": "The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears\
    \ the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom ([Insight](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Insight))\
    \ check."
  "name": "Mimicry"
"actions":
- "desc": "Melee Weapon Attack: dice: d20+6 (+6) to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.\
    \ Hit: dice:2d8 + 4|text(13) (2d8 + 4) slashing damage."
  "name": "Claws"
- "desc": "The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical\
    \ illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid\
    \ shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she\
    \ dies.\n\nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection.\
    \ For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching\
    \ her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to\
    \ visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation))\
    \ check to discern that the hag is disguised."
  "name": "Illusory Appearance"
- "desc": "The hag magically turns [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible)\
    \ until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her [concentration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#concentration)\
    \ ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible),\
    \ she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by\
    \ magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is [invisible](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#invisible)\
    \ with her."
