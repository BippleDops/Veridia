## Special Abilities

**Assassinate.** During the first round of combat, Vespara has advantage on attack rolls against creatures that haven't taken a turn yet. Any hit she scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

**Shadow Step.** As a bonus action, Vespara can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space she can see that is in dim light or darkness.

**Sneak Attack.** Once per turn, Vespara deals an extra 21 (6d6) damage when she hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll.

**Crystal Shard Poison.** Vespara's weapons are coated with crystallized shadow essence. Targets hit must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) necrotic damage and be poisoned for 1 minute.

**Evasion.** When subjected to an effect that allows a Dex saving throw for half damage, Vespara takes no damage on success and half on failure.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** Vespara makes two attacks with her Shadow Blade or throws two Crystal Shards.

**Shadow Blade.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.

**Crystal Shard.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage plus poison effect.

**Infiltrate (3/Day).** Vespara casts *pass without trace* or *invisibility* (self only).

## Description

Vespara Thorne is a legendary assassin who walks the razor's edge between Aethermoor and Aquabyssos. Once a noble's daughter from the Crystal Spires, she was touched by shadow corruption during a diplomatic mission to the depths. Rather than succumb to madness, she embraced the darkness and became something newâ€”a killer who moves between worlds like a whisper in the night.

Standing 5'6" with platinum hair streaked with shadow-black, Vespara's most striking feature is her heterochromic eyes: one crystal-blue (Aethermoor heritage), one void-black (shadow corruption). Intricate tattoos of crystalline patterns spiral down her arms, pulsing faintly with trapped shadows.

She operates from the Shadowblade District, a neutral zone where information flows like water and contracts are sealed in blood and crystal dust. Her reputation is built on three pillars: she never misses a target, she never breaks a contract, and she never kills without cause.

## Stats
- **AC**: 12
- **HP**: 22 (4d8)
- **Speed**: 30 ft.

- **INT**: 12 (+1), **WIS**: 13 (+1), **CHA**: 14 (+2)
- **Skills**: Deception +4, Insight +3, Persuasion +4
- **Senses**: passive Perception 11
- **Languages**: Common
- **Challenge**: 1/8 (25 XP)

## Relationships

**Allies:**
- **[[The Biomancers]]** - Has an uneasy alliance; they occasionally hire her services and she provides them with rare shadow-touched specimens
- **Master Keth** - Her former mentor in the Shadowblade Guild (presumed dead)
- **Whisper Network** - Information brokers throughout both realms

**Enemies:**
- **[[Parliament Loyalists]]** - They've placed a massive bounty on her head for assassinating Lord Crystalborn
- **The Purification Order** - Zealots who see her shadow corruption as an abomination
- **House Thorne** - Her own family disowned her after her transformation

**Complicated:**
- **Captain Aldric Shadowmend** - Former lover turned political rival
- **The Shadow Courts** - She owes them a debt that grows heavier each day

## Quest Hooks

1. **The Crystal Heart Contract** - Vespara has been hired to steal the Heart of Aethermoor, but the job feels wrong. She needs the party's help to uncover who's really behind the contract.

2. **Shadow Debt** - The Shadow Courts are calling in Vespara's debt. She must complete three impossible tasks or forfeit her soul. She reluctantly seeks allies.

3. **Family Reunion** - House Thorne is hosting a grand ball, and Vespara has received an invitation written in her mother's hand. It's obviously a trap, but she can't resist going.

4. **The Biomancer's Gambit** - [[The Biomancers]] have offered Vespara a cure for her shadow corruption, but the price is assassinating someone she's sworn to protect.

5. **Mentor's Legacy** - Master Keth has been spotted alive in the deepest trenches of Aquabyssos, but he's no longer entirely human. Vespara needs a team to help her reach him.

## Roleplaying Notes

**Personality**: Cool, calculated, but surprisingly moral. Speaks in measured tones with occasional flashes of dry humor.

**Ideals**: "Death should have meaning. I am the sword that cuts away corruption, even if I must be corrupted to wield it."

**Bonds**: "My brother's death will be avenged, no matter the cost to my soul."

**Flaws**: "I trust no one completely, not even those who've earned it. Everyone has a price, everyone has a secret, everyone will betray you eventually."

**Voice**: Speaks Common with an upper-class accent that she occasionally slips back into. Uses Aquabyssan curse words when frustrated.
