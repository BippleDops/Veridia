Sister Thalassa is the most devoted servant of [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]], having spent thirty years in the deepest trenches communing with her sleeping goddess.

### Special Abilities

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Thalassa fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Deep Mother's Avatar.** Thalassa channels the Deep Mother's power directly. She has advantage on saving throws against divine magic from other sources and can speak with the authority of her sleeping goddess.

**Depth Mastery.** Thalassa can survive at any depth without equipment and moves through water as if it were air. She can breathe water and air equally, and water pressure cannot harm her.

**Divine Madness Immunity.** Thalassa's faith protects her from madness effects, and she has advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws against effects that would alter her mind or memories.

**Prophetic Visions.** Thalassa regularly receives visions from the Deep Mother. At the start of each day, roll a d20. On 15+, she gains a prophetic insight that grants her advantage on one crucial roll during that day.

**Pressure Aura.** The space within 30 feet of Thalassa is filled with crushing deep-sea pressure. Creatures that start their turn in this area must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) force damage and have their speed reduced by 10 feet until the start of their next turn.

**Spellcasting.** Thalassa is an 18th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). She knows the following spells:

- **Cantrips (at will):** guidance, resistance, sacred flame, shape water, thaumaturgy
- **1st level (4 slots):** command, cure wounds, detect magic, sanctuary
- **2nd level (3 slots):** hold person, silence, spiritual weapon
- **3rd level (3 slots):** dispel magic, mass healing word, water walk
- **4th level (3 slots):** control water, freedom of movement, guardian of faith
- **5th level (3 slots):** commune, greater restoration, mass cure wounds, scrying

- **7th level (1 slot):** divine word, plane shift, regenerate
- **8th level (1 slot):** antimagic field, earthquake
- **9th level (1 slot):** gate, storm of vengeance

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Thalassa makes three attacks: two with her Deep Trident and one Pressure Wave, or she can cast a spell and make two Deep Trident attacks.

**Deep Trident.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) cold damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn as the deep ocean's crushing essence overwhelms them.

**Pressure Wave.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (4d6 + 8) force damage. The target and all creatures within 10 feet must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Deep Mother's Voice (Recharge 5-6).** Thalassa speaks a prophecy in the Deep Mother's ancient tongue. All creatures within 60 feet must make a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw. Those who fail take 36 (8d8) psychic damage and are stunned for 1 round by visions of the Deep Mother's awakening. Those who succeed take half damage and aren't stunned.

**Ritual Drowning (1/Day).** Thalassa performs the sacred drowning ritual on a willing or helpless creature within 5 feet. The target must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they begin drowning even if they can breathe water, taking 22 (4d10) necrotic damage at the start of each of their turns. The target can repeat the save at the end of each turn, ending the effect on a success. If they die from this damage, they rise as a loyal depth-touched servant under Thalassa's control.

**Summon Deep Servants (1/Day).** Thalassa calls forth 2d6 depth-touched cultists (use cultist stats with swim speed 40 ft. and water breathing) or 1d4 water elementals that serve her for 1 hour.

**Awakening Call (1/Day).** Thalassa sends a psychic call to the Deep Mother, attempting to accelerate her awakening. All creatures within 300 feet must make a DC 23 Charisma saving throw. Those who fail are charmed for 24 hours and compelled to assist in preparing for the Deep Mother's awakening. Additionally, the Deep Mother stirs, causing minor earthquakes and tidal surges in a 10-mile radius.

### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)
Thalassa can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.

**Move.** Thalassa moves up to her speed, potentially swimming through air in water-touched areas.

**Deep Strike.** Thalassa makes one Deep Trident attack.

**Pressure Pulse.** Thalassa creates a pulse of crushing pressure. All creatures within 20 feet must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) force damage.

**Cast Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Thalassa casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.

**Divine Communion (Costs 3 Actions).** Thalassa briefly communes with the Deep Mother, gaining insight into immediate threats and divine will. She regains a spent spell slot of 3rd level or lower.

### Lair Actions
When encountered in the Shrine of Sorrows or another Deep Mother sacred site, Thalassa can take lair actions on initiative count 20:

**Deep Mother's Stirring.** The ground shakes as the sleeping goddess moves. All creatures except Thalassa must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone, and the area becomes difficult terrain until the next lair action.

**Drowning Chamber.** The area fills with crushing deep-sea water. All creatures except Thalassa must hold their breath or begin drowning, and movement is halved as if underwater.

**Prophetic Vision.** All creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned for 1 round as they experience overwhelming visions of the Deep Mother's awakening and its consequences.

## Moral Complexity & Philosophical Depth

### The True Believer Dilemma
**Genuine Faith vs. Dangerous Methods**: Thalassa's absolute conviction in her Divine calling
- Her visions and experiences may represent authentic Divine communication
- Methods involve mass death and transformation that could be interpreted as genocide
- Personal sacrifice and dedication demonstrate genuine spiritual commitment
- Question of whether ends justify means when stakes involve cosmic consciousness
- Possibility that her faith is both completely genuine and completely wrong

**Divine Will vs. Human Understanding**: Interpretation of cosmic consciousness
- Deep Mother's true intentions may be impossible for mortal minds to comprehend
- Thalassa's interpretation filtered through human limitations and psychological needs
- Alternative interpretations of same Divine experiences could lead to opposite conclusions
- Question of whether acceleration serves or thwarts actual Divine will
- Uncertainty about whether Divine awakening represents salvation or apocalypse

**Individual Agency vs. Cosmic Purpose**: Personal choice within universal frameworks
- Thalassa's transformation may have eliminated her ability to choose differently
- Divine calling could represent genuine spiritual evolution or sophisticated manipulation
- Question of whether she retains human free will or has become Divine instrument
- Possibility that accepting cosmic purpose requires surrendering individual agency
- Balance between serving greater good and maintaining personal moral responsibility

### The Religious Revolution Problem
**Reform vs. Destruction**: Changing established religious structures
- Orthodox Deep Mother worship may need updating for contemporary spiritual needs
- Thalassa's methods could destroy valuable spiritual traditions and wisdom
- Revolutionary change often requires breaking established institutional power
- Question of whether gradual reform or dramatic upheaval better serves spiritual growth
- Risk that destroying old creates vacuum filled by something worse than status quo

**Authority vs. Democracy**: Who determines authentic spiritual truth
