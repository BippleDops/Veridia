## Lore Details

Legends speak of Curse of Eternal Winter as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Curse of Eternal Winter.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Curse of Eternal Winter to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
