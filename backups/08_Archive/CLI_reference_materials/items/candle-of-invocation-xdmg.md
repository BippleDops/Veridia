# Candle of Invocation
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/candle-of-invocation.webp#right)


This candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from its total burn time.

While lit, the candle sheds [Dim Light](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) in a 30-foot radius. While you are within that light, you have [Advantage](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on [D20 Tests](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb.md). In addition, a Cleric or Druid in the light can cast level 1 spells they have prepared without expending spell slots.

Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast [Gate](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/gate-xphb.md) with it. Doing so destroys the candle. The portal created by the spell links to a particular Outer Plane chosen by the DM or determined by rolling on the following table.
