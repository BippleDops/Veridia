# Cubic Gate
*Wondrous item, legendary*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/cubic-gate.webp#right)


This cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes determined by the DM.

The cube has 3 charges and regains `d3` expended charges daily at dawn. As a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you can expend 1 of the cube's charges to cast one of the following spells using the cube.

## Gate

Pressing one side of the cube, you cast [[gate-xphb|Gate]], opening a portal to the plane of existence keyed to that side.

## Plane Shift

Pressing one side of the cube twice, you cast [[plane-shift-xphb|Plane Shift]], transporting the targets to the plane of existence keyed to that side.
