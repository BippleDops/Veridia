## Aerial or Aquatic

The familiar gains either a [[fly-speed-xphb|Fly Speed]] or a [[swim-speed-xphb|Swim Speed]] (your choice) of 40 feet.

## Quick Attack

As a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]], you can command the familiar to take the [[actions#Attack|Attack]] action.

## Necrotic or Radiant Damage

Whenever the familiar deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can make it deal Necrotic or Radiant damage instead.

## Your Save DC
