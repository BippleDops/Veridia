--- # Condition

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 363. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* A condition is a temporary game state. The definition of a condition says how it affects its recipient, and various rules define how to end a condition. This glossary defines these conditions: - [[conditions#Blinded|Blinded - [conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] - [[conditions#Deafened|Deafened - [conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] - [[conditions#frightened|Frightened - [conditions#Grappled|Grappled]] - [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated - [conditions#Invisible|Invisible]] - [[conditions#Paralyzed|Paralyzed - [conditions#Petrified|Petrified]] - [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned - [conditions#prone|Prone]] - [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained - [conditions#Stunned|Stunned]] - [[conditions#Unconscious|Unconscious A condition doesn't stack with itself; a recipient either has a condition or doesn't. The [conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] condition is an exception to that rule. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Condition xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of condition xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around condition xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Second Prophecy of Depths ## Plot Hooks - A stranger needs help finding before the festival
