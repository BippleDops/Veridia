  "revised_prompt": "Imagine a heroic tabletop fantasy scene reminiscent of Dungeons and Dragons, complete with culturally coherent gear made from materials typical of the medieval fantasy era. Focus on a detailed artifact - a pair of bracers - made from a combination of pearls, coral, cloud-crystals, and pressure-forged metals, decorated with abstract sigils softly glowing. Use a human hand or ruler for size comparison. The style should be consistently painterly, avoiding any modern technology, firearms, photoreal CGI, modern signage, or anime aesthetics. Voyaging into the realm of aquatic fantasy, the bracers illuminate with subsurface caustics and bioluminescent accents, reminiscent of the scene under a pressure dome. Stick with a palette of deep blues, teals, sea-greens, and pearl highlights. Ensure that any runes present are abstract sigils, avoiding the use of any readable words or garbled letter strings. Maintain the specified aspect and resolution and sidestep any possible artifacts.",
