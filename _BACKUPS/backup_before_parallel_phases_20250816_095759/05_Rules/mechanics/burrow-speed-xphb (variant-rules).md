*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 362. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* A creature that has a Burrow Speed can use that speed to move through sand, earth, mud, or ice. The creature can't burrow through solid rock unless the creature has a trait that allows it to do so. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Burrow speed xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
