## DM Notes
Marina represents the desperate clinging to humanity while embracing monstrous transformation. She's a tragic figure who uses commerce and etiquette to maintain sanity. Her memory manipulation makes her incredibly dangerous for information-based campaigns. She should feel like a decadent noble playing elaborate games while drowning eternally. Her connection to surface operations makes her a perfect bridge between Aquabyssos and Aethermoor plots. The countdown to her 1000th drowning creates timeline pressure.
