## Overview
The real Senator Glaucus Tidecaller has been imprisoned in the [[The Memory Meadows for three weeks, trapped within living kelp that slowly drains his memories while his shadow replacement [Senator Glaucus]] takes his place in the [[Parliament of Echoes. Once a respected advocate for surface-depth reconciliation, he now struggles to maintain his identity as the kelp forest feeds on his past.
