![[xf521d3w.qs1.png|Stegocentroper|300]]
[[xf521d3w.qs1.png|open outside]]

*A massive, lumplike creature bursts from the cavern floor. It is has a huge, fanged maw flanked by mandibles, above which is a single, insectlike eye. Four chitinous tentacles emerge from its body behind its head, and the body itself is covered in bony plates with a double row of sharpened crests running down its back. Numerous centipede legs propel it forward as it continues pouring out of its burrow.*

## Special Traits
**Spines:** A stegocentroper raises its spine-plates during combat and moves rapidly back and forth while fighting. Creatures within 5 feet of the stegocentroper at the start of the monster’s turn, and creatures that make melee attacks against the stegocentroper from 5 feet or less, must make successful DC 13 Dex saving throws or take `dice: 2d8 + 1` slashing damage.

**Swallow:** A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained. It takes `dice: 1d8 + 3` bludgeoning damage plus `dice: 1d8` acid damage automatically at the start of each of the stegocentroper’s turns. Only one Medium creature or two Small creatures can be inside the stegocentroper at one time. A swallowed creature is unaffected by anything happening outside the stegocentroper or by attacks from outside it. A swallowed creature can get out of the stegocentroper by using 5 feet of movement, but only after the stegocentroper is dead.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The stegocentroper bites once, stings once, and attacks twice with tentacles.

**Melee Attack—Bite:** +8 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d10 + 4` piercing damage. If the target is also grappled by the stegocentroper, it must make a successful DC 16 Dex saving throw or be swallowed (see below).

**Melee Attack—Sting:** +8 to hit (reach 10 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 3d6 + 4` piercing damage plus `dice: 2d8` poison damage.

**Melee Attack—Tentacles:** +8 to hit (reach 30 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 3d8 + 4` bludgeoning damage, and the target must make a successful DC 16 Str saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 14). The stegocentroper can have up to two creatures grappled at one time, but the stegocentroper is prevented from making one tentacle attack for each creature it has grappled at the start of its turn.

## Description
**Environment**: Underground (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary

This abominable cross between a roper and a stegocentipede is a true nightmare of the deep places of the earth. It inherited the fierceness and strength of both species, magnified in its combination. Fortunately, it did not inherit the roper’s intelligence, having only the dim awareness of the lower forms of life. It lives to eat and believes virtually anything it meets to be potentially edible. Its first instinct in combat is always to try to swallow opponents in its ceaseless hunger. Fortunately, the aggressiveness of these creatures prevents them from mating very frequently, so while they are naturally long-lived, they seldom reproduce.
