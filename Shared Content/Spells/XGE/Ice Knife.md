# Ice Knife
You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `dice: 1d10|avg` (1d10) piercing damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `dice: 2d6|avg` (2d6) cold damage.


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the cold damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
