# Trap #56 - ''The fabled ''Earthly Reason" At Work."
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The room beyond the doors is a 20 foot cube, one wall of which consists of the doors the party has just opened. On a raised platform near the back wall is a throne three times human size. Behind the throne is an inscription inlaid in gold, on the wall.

> [!EXAMPLE]+ Message
> "No souls escape the place beyond the seat of Earthly wisdom!"

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> There are no detectable exits from this room. There are no magical auras to be found in the room either. In short it is just the party and the chair. (Comments about the relative intelligence of either are welcome.)
> 
> Clearly some one must sit in the chair, although any suitable weight will do. (Oh, some parties will think of the "throw a backpack on the chair" trick, but most won't.)
> 
> Once the throne has received weight in any volume above 20lbs. the trap will activate. The throne, and the stairs are mounted on a pivot. The whole ensemble will flip over through 180 degrees. This will have two effects, first anyone on the stairs or the throne will be dumped into an identical room below this one. The damage potential of a [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|fall]] of 20 feet for a delver who has reached this point is negligible, but there is always the possibility that someone could break his fool neck. Say, 10% chance (L1).
> 
> The second effect is to bring up an identical throne upon which is seated a humanoid figure of superhuman proportions. This figure is magical in nature, and looks like a slab of rocky mud. On the creature's lap is a sword with a rust coloured blade. In its pommel is a dull amber stone. When the floor locks back in place the [[Elemental, Earth (D&D 5e SRD)|Earth Elemental]] will rise, taking up the sword and attack the party. The elemental will have the combined [[Strength (D&D 5e SRD)|Strength]], and [[Constitution (D&D 5e SRD)|Constitution]]/Endurance of all the warriors of the party. His great sword will recieve `dice: 50D6` in combat, and will have an effect on any magical creature, just like it would on a normal mortal! \[A note to all wizards, the stone in the pommel not only renders the elemental immune to magical attack, but casts a counter spell trapping the [[Wizard (D&D 5e SRD)|wizard]] who cast the spell. This trap will consist of a pentagram etched in magic fire on the floor of the room, and will last only three turns.]
> 
> If the party flees the room the Earth Elemental will return to the throne and sit down to await their return.
> 
> If the party defeats the elemental a section of the wall behind the throne 20 feet wide will sink slowly into the ground.
> 
> The blade will remain but in the hands of a normal delver it will be only a `dice: 18D6` weapon. The gem in the pommel will still be magical in nature, but it will only ward off direct magical attack, not trap the spell caster.
> 
> The trap is not lethal unless those who are on the stairs or throne cannot think of a way out of the room under the throne. I suppose they could starve to death. But this is only a one skull trap, of course the golem is quite another thing, but he is a trap only for wizards, and in that he does them no harm.
