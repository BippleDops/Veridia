## Environmental Speech Effects

### **Aquabyssos Conditions**

#### **Extreme Pressure (Below 1000ft)**
- **Effects**: Speech slows 25%, vowels compress, pauses lengthen
- **Advantage**: Deep-adapted speakers sound authoritative
- **Disadvantage**: Surface speakers sound weak and breathless
- **Special**: Some concepts only expressible at depth

#### **Strong Currents**
- **Effects**: Must speak louder, shorter sentences
- **Challenge**: DC +3 for complex communication
- **Solution**: Hand signals supplement speech
- **Danger**: Misunderstood navigation instructions

#### **Thermal Vents**
- **Effects**: Mineral-laden water affects voice clarity
- **Benefit**: Enhanced resonance for deep speakers
- **Drawback**: Corrosive effects on surface-adapted vocal cords
- **Special**: Chemical scents supplement communication

### **Aethermoor Conditions**

#### **High Altitude (Above 5000ft)**
- **Effects**: Thin air reduces volume, changes pitch
- **Advantage**: Sky-adapted speakers gain harmonic complexity
- **Disadvantage**: Ground-bound speakers lose vocal strength
- **Special**: Crystal amplification becomes necessary

#### **Storm Conditions**
- **Effects**: Wind interferes with sound transmission
- **Challenge**: DC +5 for any spoken communication
- **Solution**: Wind song techniques or crystal amplification
- **Opportunity**: Storm-singers gain supernatural communication range

#### **Crystal Resonance Zones**
- **Effects**: Natural amplification and harmonic enhancement
- **Benefit**: Complex tonal communication becomes possible
- **Risk**: Feedback loops can cause disorientation
- **Special**: Thoughts may become audible in pure crystal areas
