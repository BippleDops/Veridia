## Recruit: Creature

When you issue the "Recruit" order to this facility, you commission the facility's hirelings to add a creature from the Menagerie Creatures table to your Menagerie. The recruitment takes 7 days and costs you the amount listed in the table. The hirelings look after the creature.

Creatures in your Menagerie count as Bastion Defenders. Deduct any you lose from your Bastion Defenders roster. You can choose not to count one or more of these creatures as Bastion Defenders, in which case they can't be called on to defend the Bastion. Instead, they act in accordance with their nature and use their stat blocks in the "Monster Manual".

With the DM's consent, you can add different creatures than those shown in the Menagerie Creatures table to your Menagerie. The cost of a creature depends on its Challenge Rating, as shown on the Creature Costs by Challenge Rating table. Typically only Beasts and some Monstrosities can be kept in a Menagerie, though the DM might allow other creatures.

**Creature Costs by Challenge Rating**

| Challenge Rating | Cost |
|------------------|------|
| 0 or 1/8 | 50 GP |
| 1/4 | 250 GP |
| 1/2 | 500 GP |
| 1 | 1,000 GP |
| 2 | 2,000 GP |
| 3 | 3,500 GP |

## Player-Facing Summary

Menagerie is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of menagerie as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around menagerie.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
