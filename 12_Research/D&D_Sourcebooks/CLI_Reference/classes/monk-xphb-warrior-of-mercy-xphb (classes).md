These Monks are wandering physicians, but they bring a swift end to their enemies. They often wear masks, presenting themselves as faceless bringers of life and death. ### Hand of Harm (Level 3) Once per turn when you hit a creature with an [[Unarmed Strike Xphb]] and deal damage, you can expend 1 Focus Point to deal extra Necrotic damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die plus your Wisdom modifier. ### Hand of Healing (Level 3) As a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you can expend 1 Focus Point to touch a creature and restore a number of [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die plus your Wisdom modifier. When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can replace one of the Unarmed Strikes with a use of this feature without expending a Focus Point for the healing. ### Implements of Mercy (Level 3) You gain proficiency in the [[skills#Insight|Insight]] and [[skills#Medicine|Medicine]] skills and proficiency with the [[Herbalism Kit Xphb]]. ### Physician's Touch (Level 6) Your Hand of Harm and Hand of Healing improve, as detailed below. #### Hand of Harm When you use Hand of Harm on a creature, you can also give that creature the [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition until the end of your next turn. #### Hand of Healing When you use Hand of Healing, you can also end one of the following conditions on the creature you heal: [[conditions#Blinded|Blinded]], [[conditions#Deafened|Deafened]], [[conditions#Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]], or [[conditions#Stunned|Stunned]]. ### Flurry of Healing and Harm (Level 11) When you use Flurry of Blows, you can replace each of the Unarmed Strikes with a use of Hand of Healing without expending Focus Points for the healing. In addition, when you make an [[Unarmed Strike Xphb]] with Flurry of Blows and deal damage, you can use Hand of Harm with that strike without expending a Focus Point for Hand of Harm. You can still use Hand of Harm only once per turn. You can use these benefits a total number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long-rest-xphb]]. ### Hand of Ultimate Mercy (Level 17) Your mastery of life energy opens the door to the ultimate mercy. As a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you can touch the corpse of a creature that died within the past 24 hours and expend 5 Focus Points. The creature then returns to life with a number of [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] equal to`4d10`plus your Wisdom modifier. If the creature died with any of the following conditions, the creature revives with the conditions removed: [[conditions#Blinded|Blinded]], [[conditions#Deafened|Deafened]], [[conditions#Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]], and [[conditions#Stunned|Stunned]]. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a [[long-rest-xphb]]. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Monk xphb warrior of mercy xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
