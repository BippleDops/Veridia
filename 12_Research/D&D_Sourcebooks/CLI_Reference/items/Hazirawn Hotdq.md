## Increased Potency

While you are attuned to this weapon, its bonus on attack and damage rolls increases to +2, and a hit deals an extra `2d6` necrotic damage (instead of `d6`).

## Spells

Hazirawn has 4 charges to cast spells. As long as the sword is attuned to you and you are holding it in your hand, you can cast [[detect-magic-xphb|detect magic]] (1 charge), [[detect-evil-and-good-xphb|detect evil and good]] (1 charge), or [[detect-thoughts-xphb|detect thoughts]] (2 charges). Each night at midnight, Hazirawn regains `d4` expended charges.

## Wounding

While you are attuned to the weapon, any creature that you hit with Hazirawn can't regain hit points for 1 minute. The target can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect early on a success.
