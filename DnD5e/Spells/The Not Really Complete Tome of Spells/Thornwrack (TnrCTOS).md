# Thornwrack (TnrCTOS)

## Overview

**School**: *transmutation*

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


## Effects
You touch a creature and cause long, painful thorns to grow out of its flesh, piercing the skin from the inside.

After each minute, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious from the pain.
