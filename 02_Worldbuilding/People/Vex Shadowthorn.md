## Vex Shadowthorn
*The Whisper in the Dark, Master of the Syndicate*

## Overview
Vex Shadowthorn controls [[The Whisper Syndicate|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/The Whisper Syndicate]], [[Aethermoor]]'s most powerful criminal organization. Brilliant, ruthless, and utterly amoral, they profit from the crystal trade's dark side while gathering blackmail on everyone of importance. They know far more about the true nature of the crystals than they should, including [[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]'s corruption.

## Secrets

*"Corruption isn't a diseaseâ€”it's evolution. The weak fear it, the strong embrace it."*

*"I know your darkest secret. The question is: what is that knowledge worth to you?"*

## Voice & Mannerisms
