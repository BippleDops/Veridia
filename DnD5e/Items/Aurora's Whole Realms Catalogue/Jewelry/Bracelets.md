**Price:**: Gold bracelet: 25 gp. Gold cuff: 35 gp. Silver bracelet: 10 gp. Silver cuff: 20 gp.

## Description
No ensemble is complete without the flash of [[Metal|metal]] at the wrist. I am pleased to offer a selection of bracelets and cuffs, in gold or silver, adorned with various semi-precious stones. Specify bracelet (finger-width) or cuff (three-fingers width), gold or silver, and choose two stones (we will endeavor to provide your first choice, to the best of our ability): onyx, hematite, rose quartz, or moonstone. No two are exactly alike; each is designed by a master jeweler in Sundabar.
