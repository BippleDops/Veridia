--- # Chromatic Orb

*1st-level, Evocation* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/chromatic-orb.webp#right) - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth 50+ GP)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous You hurl an orb of energy at a target within range. Choose Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, or Thunder for the type of orb you create, and then make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes``dice: 3d8``damage of the chosen type. If you roll the same number on two or more of the d8s, the orb leaps to a different target of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Make an attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll. The orb can't leap again unless you cast the spell with a level 2+ spell slot. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by`d8`for each spell slot level above 1. The orb can leap a maximum number of times equal to the level of the slot expended, and a creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell. **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 249.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of chromatic orb xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around chromatic orb xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Strange accidents suggest a conspiracy
