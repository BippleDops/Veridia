Some xvarts are spawned with a trace of Raxivort's divine energy. These xvarts usually form a pact with him and wield magic in his service as warlocks.

## Xvarts

Xvarts are cowardly, greedy creatures spawned by a renegade demigod, Raxivort. They have blue skin, orange eyes, and receding hairlines, mirroring their creator's appearance. They stand about 3 feet tall.

Raxivort spent centuries watching over the treasury of Graz'zt, and in time, Raxivort plundered his lord's vault. One of the treasures he stole was the *Infinity Spindle*, a crystalline shard that could transform even a creature as lowly as Raxivort into a demigod. After his apotheosis, Raxivort forged the Black Sewers, a realm within Pandemonium that he filled with his beloved creatures, rats and bats, which xvarts befriend to this day. He enjoyed his reign only briefly before Graz'zt unleashed his vengeance. The demon prince urged villains far and wide to pursue the Infinity Spindle for themselves and destroy Raxivort.
