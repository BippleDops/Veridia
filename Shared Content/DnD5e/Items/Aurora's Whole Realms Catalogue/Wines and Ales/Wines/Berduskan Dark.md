## Description
Berduskan dark wine is a heavy, sweet, and burning wine. It is very dark in hue, almost black, and high in alcohol content. It is highly prized by some across the Realms. Once Berduskan dark was bottled in a cooperative effort of guilds in Berdusk. After a falling out between the Vintners’ and Alchemists’ Guilds, the wine became available in the containers found elsewhere in Faerun. Hand keg, 14 gp; cask, 24 sp; barrel, 60 gp; bottle (when available), 12 gp.
