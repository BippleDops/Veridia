# Vampiric Touch
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within reach. On a hit, the target takes `3d6` Necrotic damage, and you regain [Hit Points](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) equal to half the amount of Necrotic damage dealt.

Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action, targeting the same creature or a different one.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d6` for each spell slot level above 3.

**Classes**: [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Warlock](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Cleric (Grave Domain)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-grave-domain-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Cleric (Death Domain)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-death-domain-dmg.md "subclass=DMG;class=XPHB"); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard (College of Lore)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
