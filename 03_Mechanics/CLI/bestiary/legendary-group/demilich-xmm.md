# Demilich

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing a demilich's lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Enervating Domain.** Whenever a creature other than the demilich or one of its allies finishes a [Long Rest](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md) within 1 mile of the lair, the creature must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or have its [Hit Point](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) maximum reduced by `d4`. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a [Long Rest](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md) outside that area.  
- **Travel Ward.** Creatures can't use teleportation or planar travel to enter or exit the lair.  

If the demilich dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
