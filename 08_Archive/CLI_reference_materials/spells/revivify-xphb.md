# Revivify
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth 300+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature revives with 1 [Hit Point](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). This spell can't revive a creature that has died of old age, nor does it restore any missing body parts.

**Classes**: [Druid](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Warlock (Celestial Patron)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-celestial-patron-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Cleric](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Ranger](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md); [Cleric (Life Domain)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-life-domain-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Cleric (Grave Domain)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-grave-domain-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Paladin](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
