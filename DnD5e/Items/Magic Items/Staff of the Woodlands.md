## Description
This [[Staff|staff]] can be wielded as a magic [[Quarterstaff|quarterstaff]] that grants a +2 bonus to [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you have a +2 bonus to [[2 - Casting a Spell|spell attack]] rolls.

The [[Staff|staff]] has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice: 1d6+4` (1d6+4) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical [[Quarterstaff|quarterstaff]].

***Spells.*** You can use an action to expend 1 or more of the [[Staff|staff]]â€™s charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]]: **[[Animal Friendship|animal friendship]]** (1 charge), **[[Awaken|awaken]]** (5 charges), **[[Barkskin|barkskin]]** (2 charges), **[[Locate Animals or Plants|Locate Animals or Plants]]** (2 charges), **[[Speak with Animals|Speak with Animals]]** (1 charge), **[[Speak with Plants]]** (3 charges), or **[[Wall of Thorns|wall of thorns]]** (6 charges).

You can also use an action to cast the **[[Pass without Trace|pass without trace]]** spell from the [[Staff|staff]] without using any charges.

***Tree Form.*** You can use an action to plant one end of the [[Staff|staff]] in fertile earth and expend 1 charge to transform the staff into a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of [[Transmutation|transmutation]] magic if targeted by **[[Detect Magic|Detect Magic]].** While touching the tree and using another action to speak its command word, you return the staff to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a staff.
