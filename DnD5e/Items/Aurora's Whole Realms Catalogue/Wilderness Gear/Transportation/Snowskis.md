## Description
One way to make your way across snow-covered wastelands is to ski crosscountry. We sell sets of these skis for all sizes of creatures. They are made of oak, and have special leather [[Straps|straps]] to wrap around your regular boots. 15 gp with a pair of [[Poles|poles]] for [[Balance|balance]] (20 gp for creatures larger than man-sized).

## Additional Details
