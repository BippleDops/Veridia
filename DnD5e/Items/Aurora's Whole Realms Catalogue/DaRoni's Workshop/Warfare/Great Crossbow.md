## Description
Most sieges are easy to begin and hard to end. I thought to myself: What siege weapon could break a fortress? what siege weapon could break down a castle door? or fell a tower? or smash a wall to rubble? And I thought: what heavy thing could impact to do this? A boulder? a small brick building? a family of giants? These things are thrown easily by a great catapult, but arc too highly and tumble too oddly to be accurate. I thought: perhaps a tree, if shot like a quarrel, would do such damage.

For King Azoun IV I built my great crossbow. He has not used it in battle. In tests it razed walls 3 feet thick and smashed solid towers. It is rolled on six wheels and holds a straight trunk 30 feet long by 2 feet wide. Pine works best, stripped of branches. Dry needles make a slick bed for launching. It must be staked into the ground before firing. None should stand in front. 1250 gp
