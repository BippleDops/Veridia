## 📝 Best Practices Going Forward

### File Placement Guide

| Content Type | Directory | Example |
|
status: active
-------------|-----------|---------|
| Adventures, Campaigns | 01_Adventures | The [[Crystal Plague|Crystal Plague]] |
| NPCs, Characters | 03_People | Captain Blackwater |
| Locations, Maps | 04_Places | Port Nimbus |
| Lore, History, Culture | 02_Worldbuilding/Lore | Ancient Empires |

| Player Handouts | 07_Player_Resources | Player_Guide |
| Templates | 09_Templates | [[NPC_Template|NPC_Template]] |

### Linking Best Practices

1. **Use Simple Links**: `[[Note [[Name|Name]]]]` instead of full paths
2. **Let Obsidian Resolve**: Trust Obsidian's link resolution
3. **Avoid Path Prefixes**: Don't include directory names in links
4. **Use Aliases**: `[[Real Name|Display Name]]` for custom text

### Naming Conventions

1. **Clear Names**: Use descriptive names without directory prefixes
2. **Spaces Allowed**: `Crystal Plague` not `Crystal_Plague`
3. **No Redundancy**: Don't repeat category in [[filename|filename]]
4. **Consistent Format**: Pick a style and stick with it

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Recommended [[actions|Actions]]
1. **Review Remaining Broken Links**: Some complex references may need manual attention
2. **Update Bookmarks**: If you have saved locations, update them
3. **Refresh Graph View**: Let Obsidian rebuild its connection graph
4. **Test Navigation**: Verify your most-used links work correctly

### Maintenance Tips
1. **Regular Backups**: Now properly stored in 08_Archive
2. **Consistent Filing**: Always use the same directory for similar content
3. **Link Checking**: Periodically run link validation
4. **Structure Documentation**: Refer to this guide when uncertain
