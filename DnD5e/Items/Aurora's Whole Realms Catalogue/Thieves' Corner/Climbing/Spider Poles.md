## Description
This odd and gangly assortment of [[Metal|metal]] [[Poles|poles]] can be collapsed into a small, lightweight bundle. When unfolded, however, the spider-[[Poles|poles]] can be snapped variously together to form a semirigid ladder or articulated frame for scaling walls. Pay careful attention when you unfold the spider [[Poles|poles]], though, or you may never remember how to collapse them.

## Additional Details
+10 bonus to Climb Walls; requires Dex check for assembly/fold up; cannot be used with other climbing equipment
