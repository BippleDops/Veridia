## Description
Over the centuries, the shepherd’s crook has become a symbol of pastoral care and watchfulness—a gentle reminder for straying lambs, and a wicked weapon against the roving wolf. Our shepherd crooks are each unique, taken from branches roped up to grow into knotted staves and harvested for this purpose. (10 gp)
