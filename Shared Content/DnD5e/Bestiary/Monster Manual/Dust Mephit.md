## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting (1/Day).*** The mephit can innately cast sleep, requiring no material components. Its innate spellcasting ability is Charisma.

***Death Burst.*** When the mephit dies, it explodes in a burst of dust. Each creature within 5 ft. of it must then succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A blinded creature can repeat the saving throw on each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Actions
***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (`dice: 1d4+2`) slashing damage.

***Blinding Breath (Recharge 6).*** The mephit exhales a 15-foot cone of blinding dust. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Variant: Summon Mephits (1/Day).*** The mephit has a 25% summoning chance chance of summoning `dice: 1d4` mephits of its kind. A summoned mephit appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other mephits. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

## Description
Composed of earth and air, dust mephits are drawn to catacombs and find death morbidly fascinating.
