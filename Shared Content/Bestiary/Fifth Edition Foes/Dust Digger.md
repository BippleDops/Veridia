## Special Traits
**Earth Glide:** A dust digger can glide through sand, loose soil, or other loosely packed earth as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole and creates no ripple on the surface or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing dust digger flings the creature back 30 feet and stuns it for one round unless it makes a successful Constitution saving throw.

**Earthy Camouflage:** A dust digger has tactical advantage on Stealth checks while it's buried in the ground.

**Sinkhole:** A buried dust digger can deflate its body as a free action, causing the sand above it to slide toward its maw. A creature standing on the surface above the dust digger when it deflates must be checked for surprise. If it is surprised, it is attacked by all five tentacles during the dust digger's surprise round. If the creature is not surprised, roll initiative normally.

**Swallow:** A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained but no longer grappled. It takes 5 (`dice: 1d8+1`) bludgeoning damage plus `dice: 1d8` acid damage automatically at the start of each of the dust digger's turns. One Medium creature or two Small creatures can be inside the dust digger at one time. A swallowed creature is unaffected by anything happening outside the dust digger or by attacks from outside it. A swallowed creature can get out of the dust digger by using 5 feet of movement, but only after the dust digger is dead.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A dust digger attacks five times; no more than one of those attacks can be a bite.

**Tentacle Slam:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d8+3`) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled.

**Tentacle Crush:** *Melee Attack:* automatic hit, one creature already grappled by a tentacle at the start of the dust digger's turn. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d8+3`) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled and restrained.

**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, one creature already grappled by a tentacle at the start of the dust digger's turn. Hit: 12 (`dice: 2d8+3`) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 13 Strength saving throw or be swallowed (see above).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Warm desert

**Organization**: Solitary, gang (4–8), or colony (9–20)

## Description
Dust diggers are desert carnivores about 10 feet in diameter. The creature spends most of its life buried under the sand, waiting for potential prey to wander too close or to actually wander directly over the buried dust digger.

A hunting dust digger inflates its body with air and buries itself under a layer of sand or dirt. When a living creature walks over the dust digger, the creature deflates its body, creating a sinkhole in the loose earth that’s similar in effect to quicksand. It folds its tentacles around the flailing victim and tries to shove the prey into its mouth.
