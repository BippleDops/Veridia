You have spent years practicing your writing and oration in the hope of becoming a student of Silverquill College.

Consider customizing how your spells look when you cast them. Your Silverquill spells might be accompanied by visual effects resembling splotches of ink or radiating ripples of golden light. Any auditory effects of your spells often sound like amplified echoes of your own voice speaking the spells' verbal componentsâ€”even amid the crash of lightning or a fiery eruption.

## Building a Silverquill Character

Many bards find a home in Silverquill, putting the power of their voices to use with Silverquill magic. Wizards (especially those who study the Schools of [[wizard-xphb-illusionist-xphb (classes)]] and Enchantment) are common in Silverquill, as are warlocks. Clerics with the Divine Domains of [[cleric-xphb-light-domain-xphb 2 (classes)]] and [[Cleric Xphb Trickery Domain Xphb]] also fit in well among the mages of Silverquill.

A number of both paladins and rogues attend Silverquill College as well, highlighting the diversity of the student body.
