## Description
This [[Rod|rod]] has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic [[Mace|mace]] that grants a +3 bonus to [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.

***Six Buttons.*** You can press one of the [[Rod|rod]]’s six buttons as a [[12 - The Order of Combat|bonus action]]. A button’s effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the [[Rod|rod]] to revert to its normal form.

If you press **button 1**, the [[Rod|rod]] becomes a [[Flame Tongue|flame tongue]], as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the [[Rod|rod]]’s flanged head.

If you press **button 2**, the [[Rod|rod]]’s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic [[Battleaxe|battleaxe]] that grants a +3 bonus to [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] and damage rolls made with it.

If you press **button 3**, the [[Rod|rod]]’s flanged head folds down, a [[Spear|spear]] point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] and damage rolls made with it.

If you press **button 4**, the [[Rod|rod]] transforms into a climbing [[Pole|pole]] up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items for Dungeons & Dragons 5e SRD/Ladder|ladder]]. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.

If you press **button 5**, the [[Rod|rod]] transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to [[Strength|Strength]] checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.

If you press **button 6**, the [[Rod|rod]] assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.

***Drain Life.*** When you hit a creature with a melee [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] using the [[Rod|rod]], you can [[17 - Damage and Healing|force]] the target to make a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 17 [[Constitution|Constitution]] saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra `dice: 4d6` (4d6) [[17 - Damage and Healing|necrotic]] damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

***Paralyze.*** When you hit a creature with a melee [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] using the [[Rod|rod]], you can [[17 - Damage and Healing|force]] the target to make a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 17 [[Strength|Strength]] saving throw. On a failure, the target is [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 1 [[7 - Time|minute]]. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.

***Terrify.*** While holding the [[Rod|rod]], you can use an action to [[17 - Damage and Healing|force]] each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 17 [[Wisdom|Wisdom]] saving throw. On a failure, a target is [[Frightened|frightened]] of you for 1 [[7 - Time|minute]]. A [[Frightened|frightened]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
