# Secret Vault Beneath Throne

*"What lies beneath the seat of power may be more valuable than the crown that rests upon it."*

## Overview

Deep beneath the Crystal Throne of Aethermoor lies one of the realm's most closely guarded secrets - a vast underground vault system that serves as both royal treasury and emergency command center. Built over centuries by paranoid monarchs, this hidden complex contains the crown's most precious treasures, darkest secrets, and contingency plans for the realm's survival.

The vault exists on seven distinct levels, each more secure and dangerous than the last. Only three living individuals know of its full extent: the reigning monarch, the Royal Treasurer [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Keeper Valdris Goldvault, and the mysterious Vault Guardian Prime, whose identity is known only to the crown.

## Discovery and Access

### Finding the Entrance
The primary entrance to the vault is concealed within the throne room itself, activated through a complex sequence involving the Crystal Throne's mystical properties. The throne must be positioned at specific angles while speaking ancient words of power in the old tongue.

**Hidden Activation Sequence:**
1. Rotate throne 47 degrees counterclockwise
2. Press the third crystal from the left on the armrest
3. Speak the phrase "Umbral Crown Descends" in Ancient Celestial
4. Touch the crown jewel while thinking of the royal bloodline

**Alternative Entrances:**
- **The Mourning Garden Route**: Hidden passage through the royal crypts (requires undead warding)

### Level 6-10: The Succession Crisis

### Level 11-15: The Deep Secrets

## DM Secrets

### The Ultimate Truth
The entire royal vault system is actually a prison designed to contain The Crown Eternal - an ancient entity that feeds on mortal ambition and power. Every monarch believes they rule, but they are actually being slowly consumed by this entity.

### The Real Purpose
The seven levels represent the seven stages of possession:
1. **Temptation** (Access to power and wealth)
2. **Corruption** (Using secrets for personal gain)
3. **Control** (Commanding others through fear)
4. **Domination** (Wielding absolute power)
5. **Isolation** (Losing connection to humanity)
6. **Desperation** (Preparing for ultimate measures)
7. **Absorption** (Complete merger with the entity)

### The Escape Clause
The vault system can be destroyed by simultaneously activating all seven levels' self-destruct mechanisms, but this requires seven people of royal blood to sacrifice themselves willingly. This would free the realm from the entity's influence but also destroy centuries of accumulated wealth and power.

### The Continuing Cycle
This has happened before. The ruins scattered across Aethermoor are remnants of previous kingdoms that fell to the same entity. The current dynasty is just the latest in a long line of victims.
