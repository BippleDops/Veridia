# Priests' Alcove
## Overview
Despite the obvious fact that priestly folk concern themselves more often with spiritual rather than material matters, priests often require as many physical implements as fighters. Most of these accoutrements are specific to a faith, or are large structures (such as altars) that we obviously could not carry. Even so, I am proud to offer the finest selection of equipment for the adventuring priest, including all clerical [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Items|items]] common to the more established and materially oriented faiths of Toril. In addition to tools of the faith, I supply implements to help the healing priest, and components necessary for all the major spells. Note that none of these [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Items|items]] carry clerical blessing or sanctification when purchased.
