> [!secret] DM Secret - The Smuggler's Alliance
> [[Harbormaster Erik Saltbeard]] is secretly aware of a sophisticated smuggling operation but allows it to continue because it provides intelligence about potential threats to the harbor. The smugglers deal in information and minor contraband rather than truly dangerous goods, and Saltbeard uses their network to monitor hostile foreign activities. However, some members of the Alliance are beginning to expand into more dangerous goods, forcing Saltbeard to consider whether to continue the arrangement.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Time-Lost Ship
> Occasionally, a mysterious skyship appears in the harbor during severe crystal storms, crewed by sailors who claim to be from different time periods. The ship appears to be jumping randomly through time, and its crew is desperate to find a way home to their own era. [[Harbor Pilot Captain Storm Skyreacher has encountered the ship multiple times and is beginning to piece together the pattern of its appearances, realizing that the ship may hold the key to understanding the true nature of crystal storms.
