Endless turmoil has scarred Wildemount, from the wars of ages long past to the more recent bloody conflicts between the many factions that lay claim to this land. These struggles have shaped the past and the future—even as they have imbued the denizens of Wildemount with the tenacity to survive in a world filled with danger.

This chapter provides stat blocks for various creatures of Wildemount. These creatures are presented in alphabetical order. For guidance on how to use a creature's stat block, see the introduction of the "Monster Manual".

## Wildemount NPCs

Appendix B of the Monster Manual contains stat blocks that can be used to represent most nonplayer characters (NPCs) in Wildemount. You can modify these stat blocks to give NPCs features similar to the character options in "chapter 4" of this book. For example, you can create an NPC dunamancer by taking the archmage or mage stat block in the "Monster Manual" and replacing some of its spells with new spells from chapter 4, or you can take the knight or veteran stat block and add a trait similar to the Manifest Echo class feature of the Echo Knight in chapter 4.

> [!quote] Elder Evils of Exandria

> Few creatures in the multiverse have any awareness of the Elder Evils, and their exact identity remains in dispute among the scant few sages who study them. Some are said to be gods, primordials, or fiends. Some are alleged to be creatures of the Far Realm. But scholars versed in the most esoteric mysteries insist that the Elder Evils are beings unlike any of those, set apart from any aspect of mortal reality, and perhaps trapped in particular planes or worlds by wandering stars, imprisoned in the vastness of the night sky. The extent to which these beings channel power on Exandria varies, as do notions of their relative strength and spheres of influence. But they are all forces of corruption and evil. Nothing good can come from their influence. No bargain made with an Elder Evil ends in anything other than madness, plague, or death.
