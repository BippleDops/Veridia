# Discover Shadow Market Location

*"The market that exists only in whispers and shadows."*

## Overview
A covert investigation quest where players must locate the hidden Shadow Market - a black market operating in the depths of Aquabyssos. This underground network deals in forbidden artifacts, illegal memory trades, and contraband from the surface world.

Success requires careful information gathering, building trust with criminal contacts, and avoiding detection by city authorities who have been trying to shut down the market for years.

## Quest Objectives

## Key NPCs

- **Captain Blackcurrent**: Smuggler with connections
- **The Broker**: Shadow market coordinator (identity unknown)

## Potential Locations
