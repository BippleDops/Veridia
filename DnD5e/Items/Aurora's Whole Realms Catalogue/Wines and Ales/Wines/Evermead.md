## Description
Evermead is *the* elven meadâ€”the one against which all other meads (and any other drinks) are compared. A sip is reputed to be a taste of the higher planes themselves. Made according to closely guarded traditional methods in Evermeet and allegedly aged for hundreds of years, very few kegs of Evermead ever reach non-elven hands. Outside of Evermeet, Evermead can be bought only through direct contact with me. Hand keg, 50 gp; bottle, 30 gp.
