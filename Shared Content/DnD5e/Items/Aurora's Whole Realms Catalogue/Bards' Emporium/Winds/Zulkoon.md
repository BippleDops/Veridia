## Description
Zulkoon are portable organs. By means of a [[Bellows|bellows]] contraption that lies upon the ground and is pumped by the playerâ€™s feet, air is forced over what amount to a set of odd organ pipes. The constant flow of air from the zulkoon produces a loud drone that underlies the other tones. (95 gp)
