## Description
Those who think saddles uncomfortable have never ridden a horse bareback. Our saddle (10 gp) is far from uncomfortable, made of the finest blacked Ordulan leather, with elegantly tooled fenders, a single-cinch strap, and a fourteen inch tree. Includes [[Straps|straps]] for the addition of saddlebags. The saddle rests comfortably upon our contoured saddleblanket (2 sp).
