Born to an elvish sea captain and a human dock worker, Luna grew up straddling two worlds—the structured hierarchy of maritime law and the rough-and-tumble reality of port life. ### Rise to Power

Luna's path to becoming Harbor Master was unconventional. Originally a smuggler and information broker operating from the docks, she earned her position through a combination of blackmail, genuine competence, and a spectacular public service when she single-handedly prevented a [Kraken]] attack on the harbor by coordinating the city's defenses while the official Harbor Master cowered in his office. The [[City Council of Aquabyssos recognized her natural leadership and appointed her to the role, much to the chagrin of more traditional candidates. ### Current Authority

As Harbor Master, Luna oversees all maritime traffic entering and leaving [Aquabyssos]], manages the complex web of dock fees, shipping schedules, and trade regulations, and serves as the de facto law enforcement for the harbor district. Her authority extends to investigating smuggling, piracy, and other maritime crimes, making her one of the most influential figures in the city's economy. ### The Freedrift Network

Luna maintains her old contacts from her smuggling days, creating an extensive intelligence network that spans from the lowest dock workers to the highest-ranking ship captains. This network, known as the [[Freedrift Network, provides her with information about everything happening in and around [Aquabyssos]]'s waters, making her an invaluable ally and a dangerous enemy. ### The Harbor Master's Trials

For those seeking special privileges or access to restricted areas of the harbor, Luna has established informal "trials": 1. **The Trial of Trust:** Proving reliability through completion of a small but important task
2. **The Trial of Value:** Demonstrating what you can offer the harbor community
3. **The Trial of Loyalty:** Showing commitment to [[Aquabyssos's prosperity and safety ## Personality & Demeanor Luna embodies the spirit of freedom that her surname suggests. She's quick-witted, adaptable, and possesses an infectious confidence that draws people to her cause. Despite her criminal past, she genuinely cares about [Aquabyssos]] and works to make the harbor a place where honest merchants can prosper while keeping truly dangerous elements at bay. ### The Ghost Ship Incident

A mysterious vessel called [[The Phantom Current has been spotted in [Aquabyssos]] waters, seemingly crewed by undead sailors. Luna needs trustworthy agents to investigate without causing panic among the merchant fleet. She suspects the ship is connected to an ancient curse but needs proof before taking official action. ### The Smuggling War

Two rival smuggling operations are escalating their conflict, threatening to spill over into legitimate harbor operations. Luna must maintain plausible deniability while maneuvering the groups into either peace or mutual destruction. She's looking for discrete operatives to handle sensitive negotiations. ### The Deep Trade Routes

Strange reports from deep-sea fishing vessels suggest new trade routes opening to previously unknown civilizations in the ocean depths. Luna wants to establish [[Aquabyssos's claim to these routes but needs explorers to chart the waters and establish first contact protocols. ### The Harbor Master's Gambit

Political pressure is mounting to replace Luna with a more "traditional" candidate from the [Noble Houses]]. She's building a coalition of supporters while gathering leverage on her opponents, but needs allies who can operate in both legitimate and shadowy circles. ### The Siren's Bargain

A group of [[Sirens has approached Luna with a proposal for safe passage through their territorial waters in exchange for certain considerations. The deal could revolutionize shipping routes but comes with moral complications that Luna needs help navigating. ## Luna's Harbor Office Located in the [Harbor Master's Tower]], a converted lighthouse overlooking the main docks, Luna's office serves as both command center and social hub. The circular room features: - **Navigation Charts:** Covering every wall, constantly updated with new information

- **Message Tubes:** A pneumatic system connecting to key locations throughout the harbor
- **The Freedrift Ledger:** Luna's personal record of debts, favors, and obligations
- **Compass Rose Table:** A massive table with a built-in compass rose for planning operations
- **Emergency Signals:** Magical communication devices for coordinating harbor defenses --- *"The tide waits for no one, but a smart sailor learns to read the currents. In this harbor, I am both tide and current—cross me at your peril, sail with me to prosperity."* - Harbor Master Luna Freedrift ## Player-Facing Summary Harbor Master Luna Freedrift is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
