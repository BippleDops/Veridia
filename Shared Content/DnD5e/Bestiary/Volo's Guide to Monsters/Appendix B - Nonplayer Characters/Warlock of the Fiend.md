1/day each: *feeblemind, finger of death, plane shift*

***Dark One's Own Luck (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** When the warlock makes an ability check or saving throw, it can add a `dice: d10` to the roll. It can do this after the roll is made but before any of the roll's effects occur.

***Spellcasting.*** The warlock is a 17th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It regains its expended spell slots when it finishes a short or long rest. It knows the following warlock spells:

Cantrips (at will): *eldritch blast, fire bolt, friends, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation, shocking grasp*

1st - 5th level (4 5th-level slots): *banishment, burning hands, flame strike, hellish rebuke, magic circle, scorching ray, scrying, stinking cloud, suggestion, wall of fire*

## Description
Warlocks of the fiend gain their powers through magical pacts forged with archfiends of the Lower Planes. These warlocks often keep imps or quasits as companions, and they tend toward extremes of behavior: consorting with fiend-worshiping cultists or dedicating their lives to destroying fiendish cults.
