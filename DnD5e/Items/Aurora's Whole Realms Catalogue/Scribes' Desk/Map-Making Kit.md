## Description
Are you tired of losing adventuring companions to catastrophe because you canâ€™t find your way back out of a dungeon quickly enough? Do you get tired of backtracking repeatedly through endless miles of wilderness terrain, searching for someplace you should have found already? Then this kit is for you. Within one small, oaken map tube, sealed against the elements, you will find: a starter set of 10 pages of mapping parchment, with a grid line system already thoughtfully drawn in; a set of five colored charcoal markers; a pair of scales, for measuring distances; a quill pen with three nibs; a miniature bottle of ink; a thin steel rule, to help measure and draw straight lines, which also has some commonly used mapping stencils, such as the North arrow, stairs, and swinging doors; and finally, the Handbook of Mapping for Better Mapping Etiquette. This guide shows the fledgling mapmaker how to read and draw accurate, quality maps, using widely accepted symbols and terminology. It also provides sample maps of Waterdeep and the Sword Coast, for the beginning mapper to study and learn from. We offer this kit to you at the unbelievably low price of 35 gp. You may also order refills of gridded parchment (45 gp for 50 sheets), and charcoal (2 gp for five sticks of five colors each).

## Additional Details
It is left entirely up to the DM how he wishes to design the Handbook of Mapping, if at all, and details the provided maps might give.
