*Adventuring gear* - **Cost**: 1 gp
- **Weight**: 5.0 lbs. As a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize action, you can tie a knot with Rope if you succeed on a **DC 10** Dexterity ([skills#Sleight%20of%20Hand|Sleight of Hand]]) check. The Rope can be burst with a successful **DC 20** Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics) check. You can bind an unwilling creature with the Rope only if the creature has the [conditions#Grappled|Grappled]], [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated, or [conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition. If the creature's legs are bound, the creature has the [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained condition until it escapes. Escaping the Rope requires the creature to make a successful **DC 15** Dexterity ([skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]) check as an action. *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 228.
