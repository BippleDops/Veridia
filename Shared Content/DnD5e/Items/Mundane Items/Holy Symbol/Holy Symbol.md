# Holy Symbol

## Overview
**Holy Symbol.** A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an [[Amulet|amulet]] depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an [[Emblem|emblem]] on a [[Shield|shield]], or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix PH-‐‑B "Fantasy-‐‑Historical Pantheons" lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A [[Cleric|cleric]] or [[Paladin|paladin]] can use a holy symbol as a [[7 - Spellcasting|spellcasting]] focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a [[Shield|shield]].
