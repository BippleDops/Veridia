# Deepmind Conspiracy

*"In the depths of consciousness, where thoughts flow like currents, we have built the ultimate intelligence network - one that exists in minds rather than matter."*

## Overview

The Deepmind Conspiracy represents the most sophisticated intelligence operation in either Aethermoor or Aquabyssos - a psychic network that exists primarily in the collective consciousness of its members rather than in physical space. This mental infrastructure allows for instantaneous communication, shared knowledge, and coordinated operations across vast distances without leaving any physical evidence.

Built around a core of powerful psychic individuals, the Conspiracy maintains a hidden web of informants, analysts, and operatives whose minds are linked through complex mental bonds. They gather intelligence not through conventional means, but by reading thoughts, accessing memories, and manipulating the mental states of targets. The organization serves as the primary intelligence resource for multiple shadow organizations while maintaining its own mysterious agenda.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Deepmind Conspiracy as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Deepmind Conspiracy.
