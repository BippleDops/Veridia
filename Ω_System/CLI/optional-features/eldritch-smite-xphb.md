*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 155*  

**Prerequisite**: Level 5 Warlock

Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you can expend a Pact Magic spell slot to deal an extra `d8` Force damage to the target, plus another `d8` per level of the spell slot, and you can give the target the [Prone](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Prone) condition if it is Huge or smaller.
