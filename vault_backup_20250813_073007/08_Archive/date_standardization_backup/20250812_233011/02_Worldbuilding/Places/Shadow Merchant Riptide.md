**Role:** Information Broker and Black Market Dealer  
**Location:** [[Shadow Market Canals]] - Mobile operations  
**Affiliations:** [[Shadow Surgeons Collective]], [[The Whisper Syndicate]]  
**Specialties:** Memory trafficking, identity forgery, political blackmail

## Overview
Riptide operates as one of [[Aquabyssos]]'s most dangerous information brokers, dealing in stolen memories, forged identities, and political secrets. His network spans from the deepest criminal organizations to corrupt government officials. What makes him particularly dangerous is his collection of "insurance memories" - compromising experiences extracted from powerful figures that ensure his protection and influence.

- Never meets in the same location twice
- Always has three escape routes planned

### Secret Operations

## DM Notes

### Using Riptide Effectively
- Never show all his cards at once - he always has more information than he reveals
- Make him simultaneously helpful and threatening in every interaction
- Use his network to provide information party needs, but at moral cost
- Present him as symptom of larger problems rather than root cause

### Balancing His Power
- His information is valuable but not always accurate or complete
- Political connections protect him but also create obligations and enemies
- Memory abilities have limitations and costs that can be exploited
- His paranoia sometimes leads to mistakes and overreactions

### Character Development
- Could become ally if party proves trustworthy and useful long-term
- Might seek redemption if confronted with full consequences of his actions
- Could be redeemed through sacrifice that saves others from his fate
- Alternatively, could become increasingly corrupted and dangerous over time

> [!danger] DM Secret
> Riptide is actually the original founder of the [[Shadow Surgeons Collective]], but he had his own memories of this fact surgically removed to protect himself from retaliation. The current leadership of the Collective doesn't know their organization's true origins, and Riptide himself has forgotten why he sometimes experiences unexplained familiarity with their operations. If this truth is revealed, it could either destroy the Collective or reunite it under his leadership, dramatically shifting the criminal landscape of [[Aquabyssos]].
