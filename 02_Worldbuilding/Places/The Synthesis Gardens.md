# The Synthesis Gardens

*Where nature and crystal become one abomination*

## Overview
Hidden deep within [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Verdant Reach]], the Synthesis Gardens represent [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Sorrow-Root Nightbloom]]'s primary laboratory - a corrupted grove where plant and crystal merge in horrifying ways. This living dungeon grows and changes, making each visit unique and increasingly dangerous.

## Description
The Gardens exist in a two-mile radius of corrupted forest where the boundaries between plant, crystal, and flesh blur. Trees with crystalline bark pulse with internal light, while crystal formations sprout leaves and bleed sap. The air itself shimmers with pollen that carries corruption, and the ground shifts between soil, crystal, and something disturbingly in-between.

## Areas

### The Germination Chambers
Former druid groves converted into experimental plots where Sorrow-Root tests new hybrid creations. Each chamber holds different abominations:
- **Chamber of Thorns**: Crystalline roses that shoot penetrating thorns
- **The Breathing Stones**: Crystals that inhale and exhale corrupting spores
- **Flesh Garden**: Where captured animals and people are "planted"

### The Spiral Greenhouse
A massive glass and crystal structure spiraling into the earth, each level more corrupted than the last:
- **Level 1**: Seemingly normal plants with subtle crystal veining
- **Level 2**: Mobile plant-crystal hybrids that hunt intruders
- **Level 3**: The Merger Pools - where subjects are transformed
- **Level 4**: The Heart Root - Sorrow-Root's personal sanctuary

### The Compost Heaps
Mass graves of failed experiments that have merged into shambling mounds of crystal, plant, and bone. They hunger for fresh material to add to their mass.

### The Canopy Network
Corrupted trees whose branches have fused into bridges and platforms. The [[Withered Court]] uses these as highways, while crystal fruit hanging from branches grants temporary abilities at the cost of corruption.

## Inhabitants
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Sorrow-Root Nightbloom]]** - Master of the Gardens
- **Withered Court Druids** - 20-30 corrupted nature worshippers
- **Thornlings** - Humanoid plant-crystal hybrids (former druids)
- **The Gardeners** - Shambling mounds that tend the experiments
- **Crystal Dryads** - Once-beautiful fey now made of living crystal

## Connections
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Verdant Reach]]**: Hidden in the deepest, most corrupted section
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Archdruid Thornweaver]]**: Constantly sends scouts to monitor the Gardens
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Drowned Embassy]]**: [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Korvin Blacktide]] secretly funds experiments
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]]**: Source of unwilling test subjects via [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Whisper Syndicate]]

## Environmental Hazards

### Corruption Pollen
- DC 13 CON save every hour or gain 1 level of crystal corruption
- Thick areas require saves every 10 minutes
- Can be filtered with proper equipment

### Living Architecture
- Walls and floors can suddenly sprout attacking appendages
- Doors are actually mouth-like openings that might close on victims
- Stairs and bridges can retract or reshape

### The Garden's Hunger
- Spilled blood causes rapid plant growth that entangles
- Crystal formations drain magic items of power
- Extended stays (8+ hours) require WIS saves or suffer personality changes

## Current Experiments
- **Project Seedfall**: Corrupted seeds that can transform entire forests
- **The Perfect Hybrid**: Attempting to create a creature immune to but empowered by corruption
- **Crystal Photosynthesis**: Plants that feed on crystal energy instead of sunlight
- **The Green Death**: Fungal weapon designed to target crystal users

## DM Secrets
> [!warning] The Living Dungeon
> The Gardens are becoming sentient. Each experiment adds to a collective consciousness that's beginning to act independently of Sorrow-Root. It may soon decide it doesn't need any master.

> [!danger] The Root Network
> The Gardens' root system extends for miles underground, slowly corrupting [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Verdant Reach]] from below. These roots are approaching [[Ironhold]] and could destabilize the dwarven city's foundations.

> [!info] Hidden Cure
> Ironically, one of Sorrow-Root's failed experiments (Batch 7-Alpha) actually reverses crystal corruption. They destroyed most samples, but one grows in the deepest chamber, guarded by their most trusted lieutenants.

## Notable Features

### The Symbiosis Pools
Three pools of liquid crystal-sap that can grant powerful mutations:
- **Pool of Thorns**: Gain natural armor but vulnerability to fire
- **Pool of Roots**: Gain tremorsense but reduced speed
- **Pool of Blooms**: Gain charm abilities but weakness to necrotic damage

### The Ancestral Tree
A massive oak corrupted into crystal but still somehow alive, containing the trapped souls of druids who opposed Sorrow-Root. Can provide information if freed.

### The Harvest Moon Chamber
An underground chamber with artificial moonlight that accelerates growth. One hour here equals one month of growth, but ages visitors proportionally.

## Treasure & Resources
- Hybrid seeds (valuable to alchemists and dangerous in wrong hands)
- Crystallized sap (powerful but corrupting alchemical ingredient)
- Living weapons (swords that grow, armor that regenerates)
- Druidic artifacts corrupted into new forms
- Research notes on corruption resistance

## Encounter Table (d10)
1-2: Thornling patrol (3-4 creatures, CR 3 each)
3-4: Corrupted dire beasts (bears, wolves with crystal mutations)
5-6: Withered Court druid with plant minions
7: Living garden section (walls attack, floor entangles)
8: Crystal dryad attempting to charm party
9: Failed experiment shambling mound
10: Sorrow-Root's lieutenant checking experiments

## Plot Hooks
- Rescue captured druids before transformation
- Steal or destroy the Green Death before deployment
- Find the hidden corruption cure
- Stop the root network from reaching [[Ironhold]]
- Infiltrate a Withered Court gathering
- Prevent alliance between Sorrow-Root and [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Korvin Blacktide]]
- [[Quest - The Root Network]]
