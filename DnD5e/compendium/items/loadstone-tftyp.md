# Loadstone
*Wondrous Item, rare*  

- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This stone is a large gem worth 150 gp.

## Curse

The stone is cursed, but its magical nature is hidden; [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) doesn't detect it. An [identify](/compendium/spells/identify.md) spell reveals the stone's true nature. If you use the Dash or Disengage action while the stone is on your person, its curse activates. Until the curse is broken with [remove curse](/compendium/spells/remove-curse.md) or similar magic, your speed is reduced by 5 feet, and your maximum load and maximum lift capacities are halved. You also become unwilling to part with the stone.
