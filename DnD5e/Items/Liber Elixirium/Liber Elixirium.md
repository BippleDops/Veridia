# Liber Elixirium
## Overview
**[[Potions]] and Oils**

**01 Physic of Fitness - Cure Disease**

Remove disease cures all diseases that the subject is suffering from. The spell also kills parasites, including green slime and others. Certain special diseases may not be countered by this spell or may be countered only by a caster of a certain level or higher. Note: Since the spell’s [[4 - Duration|duration]] is [[Instantaneous|instantaneous]], it does not prevent reinfection after a new exposure to the same disease at a later date.

**02 [[Mother's Kiss]] - Cure [[Light]] Wounds**

When laying your hand upon a living creature, you channel positive energy that cures `dice: 1d8` points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +5). Since undead are powered by negative energy, this spell deals damage to them instead of curing their wounds. An undead creature can apply spell [[Resistance|resistance]], and can attempt a Will save to take half damage.

**03 [[Remedy of Repair]] - Cure Moderate Wounds**

This spell functions like [cure light wounds](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/cureLightWounds.htm), except that it cures [`dice: 2d8`](javascript:void(0);) points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +10).

**04 [[Solution of Salubriousness]] - Cure Serious Wounds**

This spell functions like [cure light wounds](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/cureLightWounds.htm), except that it cures [`dice: 3d8`](javascript:void(0);) points of damage +1 point per caster level (maximum +15).

**05 [[Remedy of Rejuvenation]] - Cure Critical Wounds**

This spell functions like cure [[Light|light]] wounds, except that it cures `dice: 4d8` points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20).

**06 Venom Vaporizor - Neutralize [[0. DM Screen/Weapons, Armor, Items, Spells/Poison]]**

You detoxify any sort of venom in the creature or object touched. A [[Poisoned|poisoned]] creature suffers no additional effects from the [[0. DM Screen/Weapons, Armor, Items, Spells/Poison|poison]], and any temporary effects are ended, but the spell does not reverse [[Instantaneous|instantaneous]] effects, such as hit point damage, temporary ability damage, or effects that don’t go away on their own. The creature is immune to any [[0. DM Screen/Weapons, Armor, Items, Spells/Poison|poison]] it is exposed to during the [[4 - Duration|duration]] of the spell. Unlike with delay [[0. DM Screen/Weapons, Armor, Items, Spells/Poison|poison]], such effects aren’t postponed until after the [[4 - Duration|duration]] —the creature need not make any saves against [[0. DM Screen/Weapons, Armor, Items, Spells/Poison|poison]] effects applied to it during the length of the spell. This spell can instead neutralize the [[0. DM Screen/Weapons, Armor, Items, Spells/Poison|poison]] in a poisonous creature or object for the [[4 - Duration|duration]] of the spell, at the caster’s option.

**07 [[Valuable View]] - Remove Blindness**

Remove blindness cures blindness , whether the effect is normal or magical in nature. The spell does not restore eyes that have been lost, but it repairs them if they are damaged. Remove blindness counters and dispels blindness.

**08 [[Auditory Antidote]] - Remove Deafness**

Remove deafness cures deafness, whether the effect is normal or magical in nature. The spell does not restore ears that have been lost, but it repairs them if they are damaged. Remove deafness counters and dispels deafness.

**09 [[Mother's Milk]] - Remove [[Frightened|Fear]]**

You instill courage in the subject, granting it a +4 morale bonus against [[Frightened|fear]] effects for 10 minutes. If the subject is under the influence of a [[Frightened|fear]] effect when receiving the spell, that effect is suppressed for the [[4 - Duration|duration]] of the spell. Remove [[Frightened|fear]] counters and dispels cause [[Frightened|fear]].

**10 Physic of Prevention - Resist [[0. DM Screen/Weapons, Armor, Items, Spells/Poison]]**

You receive a +4 bonus to all Constitution saves against [[0. DM Screen/Weapons, Armor, Items, Spells/Poison|poison]] for the next hour.

**11 Rolling Thunder's Remedy of Reanimation - [[Raise Dead]]**

You restore life to a deceased creature. You can raise a creature that has been [dead](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#dead) for no longer than one day per caster level. In addition, the subject’s soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject’s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return receives no [saving throw](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#savingThrows).

Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The subject of the spell loses one level (or 1 Hit Die) when it is raised, just as if it had lost a level or a Hit Die to an energy-draining creature. If the subject is 1st level, it loses 2 points of Constitution instead (if this would [[Enlarge_Reduce|reduce]] its Con to 0 or less, it can’t be raised). This level/HD loss or Constitution loss cannot be repaired by any means. A character who died with [[PHB - Spells|spells]] prepared has a 50% chance of losing any given spell upon being raised, in addition to losing [[PHB - Spells|spells]] for losing a level. A [[Chapter 10 - Spellcasting|spellcasting]] creature that doesn’t prepare [[PHB - Spells|spells]] (such as a [sorcerer](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/sorcererWizard.htm#sorcerer)) has a 50% chance of losing any given unused spell slot as if it had been used to cast a spell, in addition to losing [[4 - Spell Slots|spell slots]] for losing a level.

A raised creature has a number of hit points equal to its current Hit Dice. Any ability scores damaged to 0 are raised to 1. Normal [poison](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#poison) and normal [disease](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#disease) are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. None of the dead creature’s [[Chapter 5 - Equipment|equipment]] or possessions are affected in any way by this spell.

A creature who has been turned into an [undead](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#undeadType) creature or killed by a [death effect](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#deathAttacks) can’t be raised by this spell. [Constructs](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#constructType), [elementals](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#elementalType), [outsiders](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#outsiderType), and undead creatures can’t be raised. The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age.

**12 Barman's Brew - Sobriety**

You become completely sober for 1 hour, negating any penalties to your actions for being drunk. Magical and alchemical methods (such as detect [[0. DM Screen/Weapons, Armor, Items, Spells/Poison|poison]]) still detect you as inebriated. Time spent under the effect of this panacea do not count toward the time necessary to sober up (it merely delays your intoxication).

**13 Lorelie's Bewitching Beauty - Increase Charisma**

[[Eagle]]’s Splendor. The target has advantage on Charisma checks. 1 hour.

**14 Physic of Fortitude - Increase Constitution**

Bear’s Endurance. The target has advantage on Constitution checks. It also gains `dice: 2d6` temporary hit points, which are lost when the spell ends. 1 hour.

**15 [[Noble]] Nimbleness - Increase Dexterity**

[[Cat]]’s Grace. The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn’t take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn’t [[Incapacitated|incapacitated]]. 1 hour.

**16 Amarth's Boost of Brilliance - Increase Intelligence**

Fox’s Cunning. The target has advantage on Intelligence checks. 1 hour.

**17 Mixture of Might - Increase Strength**

Bull’s Strength. The target has advantage on Strength checks, and his or her carrying capacity doubles. 1 hour.

**18 Masquerade - [[Alter Self]]**

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [[Alter Self]] spell.

**19 Mae Mae's Animal Expansion - Animal Growth**

The target animal grows to twice its normal size and eight times its normal weight. This alteration changes the animal's size category to the next largest, grants it a +8 size bonus to Strength and a +4 size bonus to Constitution (and thus an extra 2 hit points per HD), and imposes a -2 size penalty to Dexterity. The creature's existing natural armor bonus increases by 2. The size change also affects the animal's modifier to AC, attack rolls, and its base damage. The animal's space and reach change as appropriate to the new size, but its speed does not change. If insufficient room is available for the desired growth, the creature attains the maximum possible size and may make a Strength check (using its increased Strength) to burst any enclosures in the process. If it fails, it is constrained without [[Harm|harm]] by the materials enclosing it--the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.

All [[Chapter 5 - Equipment|equipment]] worn or carried by the animal is similarly enlarged by the spell, though this change has no effect on the magical properties of any such [[Chapter 5 - Equipment|equipment]].

Any enlarged item that leaves the enlarged creature's possession instantly returns to its normal size.

The spell gives no means of [[Command|command]] over an enlarged animal.

Multiple magical effects that increase size do not stack.

[[4 - Duration|Duration]]: 10 minutes

**20 Melnimicar's Vision - Arcane sight**

This spell makes your eyes glow blue and allows you to see magical auras within 120 ft of you. The effect is similar to that of the '[[Detect Magic|detect magic]]' spell, but 'arcane sight' does not require [[Concentration|concentration]] and discerns aura location and power more quickly.

You know the location and power of all magical auras within your sight. An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning level or an item's caster level. If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Arcana skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each (make on check per aura; DC 15 + [[1 - Spell Level|spell level]], of 15 for a nonspell effect).

If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 ft of you as an action, you can determine whether it has any [[Chapter 10 - Spellcasting|spellcasting]] or spell-like abilities, whether these are arcane or divine (spell like abilities register as arcane), and the strength of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use. In some cases, 'arcane sight' may give a deceptively low reading--for example, when you use it on a spellcaster who has used up most of his or her daily spell allotment.

[[4 - Duration|Duration]]: 10 minutes

**21 Draught of Distortion - [[Blur]]**

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [[Blur]] spell.

**22 Animal Magnetism - [[Charmed|Charm]] Animal**

You attempt to [[Charmed|charm]] a Animal you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is [[Charmed|charmed]] by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The [[Charmed|charmed]] creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was [[Charmed|charmed]] by you.

**23 Creature Cordial - [[Charmed|Charm]] Monster**

You attempt to [[Charmed|charm]] a Monster you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is [[Charmed|charmed]] by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The [[Charmed|charmed]] creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was [[Charmed|charmed]] by you.

**24 Personal Allure - [[Charm Person]]**

You attempt to [[Charmed|charm]] a Animal you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is [[Charmed|charmed]] by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The [[Charmed|charmed]] creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was [[Charmed|charmed]] by you.

**25 Elixir of Eavesdropping - Clairaudience**

You create an [[Invisible|invisible]] sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the [[4 - Duration|duration]], and it can’t be attacked or otherwise interacted with. You can hear through the sensor as if you were in its space. A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from [[See Invisibility|see invisibility]] or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible [[Orb|orb]] about the size of your fist.

**26 Farsight - [[Clairvoyance]]**

You create an [[Invisible|invisible]] sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the [[4 - Duration|duration]], and it can’t be attacked or otherwise interacted with. You can see through the sensor as if you were in its space. A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting from [[See Invisibility|see invisibility]] or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible [[Orb|orb]] about the size of your fist.

**27 Solution of the Soulless - [[Command]] Undead**

You speak a one-word [[Command|command]] to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or follow the [[Command|command]] on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn’t understand your language, or if your [[Command|command]] is directly harmful to it.

Some typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a [[Command|command]] other than one described here. If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves. If the target can’t follow your [[Command|command]], the spell ends.

- **Approach**. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet o f you.
- **Drop**. The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.
- **Flee**. The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.
- **Grovel**. The target falls [[Prone|prone]] and then ends its turn.
- **Halt**. The target doesn’t move and takes no actions. A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.

**28 Cordial of Comprehension - [[Comprehend Languages]]**

For the [[4 - Duration|duration]], you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the w ords are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.

This spell doesn’t decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn’t part of a written language.

**29 Elixir of the Eclipse - [[Darkvision]]**

When you drink the potion, you gain [[Darkvision]] for the next 4 hours.

**30 Moral Findings - Detect Alignment**

Upon drinking this potion your eye-sight adjusts. The target's alignment is revealed as coloured auras, blue for good, grey for unaligned and red for evil. Also, lighter shades reveal lawfullness, and darker shades chaos. Detect Alignment can be fooled, however, if a significantly powerful [[6 - Ritual|ritual]] or artifact imbues a person and changes their aura.

Detect Alignment can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of [[Common|common]] metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it. Animals, traps, poisons and other potential perils are not evil and cannot be detected through this method, nor can potentially helpful items such as food, [[Potions|potions]], or magicically imbued (Unless Artifacts)as they are not good. Unaligned objects and entities do not appear with this method either.

**31 Physic of Fact Finding - Detect Lie**

Each round, you concentrate on one subject, who must be within range. You know if the subject deliberately and knowingly speaks a lie by discerning disturbances in its aura caused by lying. The spell does not reveal the truth, uncover unintentional inaccuracies, or necessarily reveal evasions. Each round, you may concentrate on a different subject.

**32 Drinkable Dressing - [[Disguise Self]]**

You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends or until you u se your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent o f the [[Illusion|illusion]] is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it w ould feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand o f someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.

To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

**33 Cordial of Comfort - Endure Elements**
A creature protected by endure elements suffers no [[Harm|harm]] from being in a hot or cold environment. It can exist comfortably in conditions between -50 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit (-45 and 60 degrees Celsius) without having to make Fortitude saves. The creature's [[Chapter 5 - Equipment|equipment]] is likewise protected. 24 hours

**34 Potion of Grounding - Energy/ Electricity**

For the [[4 - Duration|duration]], the creature who consumes the potion has [[Resistance|resistance]] to lightning damage.

[[4 - Duration|Duration]]: 1 hour

**35 Blacksmith's Brew - Energy/Fire [[Resistance]]**

For the [[4 - Duration|duration]], the creature who consumes the potion has [[Resistance|resistance]] to fire damage.

[[4 - Duration|Duration]]: 1 hour

**36 Polar Philter - Energy/Frost [[Resistance]]**

For the [[4 - Duration|duration]], the creature who consumes the potion has [[Resistance|resistance]] to cold damage.

[[4 - Duration|Duration]]: 1 hour

**37 Expanding Extract - [[Enlarge_Reduce|Enlarge]] Person**

When you drink this potion, you gain the "[[Enlarge_Reduce|enlarge]]" effect of the [[Enlarge_Reduce|enlarge/reduce]] spell for `dice: 1d4` hours (no [[Concentration|concentration]] required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the [[Bottle|bottle]] fails to interrupt this process.

**38 Ainyele's True Thought - ESP**

**39 Delicate Drop - Featherfall**

You rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the potion wears off. The potion last for 5 minutes.

**40 Spurious [[Sleep]] - [[Feign Death]]**
You touch a willing creature and put it into a cataleptic state that is indistinguishable from death. For the spell’s [[4 - Duration|duration]], or until you use an action to touch the target and dismiss the spell, the target appears dead to all outward inspection and to [[PHB - Spells|spells]] used to determine the target’s status. The target is [[Blinded|blinded]] and [[Incapacitated|incapacitated]], and its speed drops to 0. The target has [[Resistance|resistance]] to all damage except psychic damage. If the target is diseased or [[Poisoned|poisoned]] when you cast the spell, or b ecomes diseased or [[Poisoned|poisoned]] while under the spell’s effect, the disease and [[0. DM Screen/Weapons, Armor, Items, Spells/Poison|poison]] have no effect until the spell ends.

**41 Countess Shelby's Soaring Solution - Flying**

You touch a willing creature. The target gains a flying speed o f 60 feet for the [[4 - Duration|duration]]. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft, unless it can stop the fall. Lasts for 10 minutes.

**42 Memory Dismissal - Forget**

You attempt to reshape another creature’s memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes [[Charmed|charmed]] by you for the [[4 - Duration|duration]]. The [[Charmed|charmed]] target is [[Incapacitated|incapacitated]] and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target’s memories are modified.

While this [[Charmed|charm]] lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event.

You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature’s memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in [[Acid|acid]], is dismissed, perhaps as a bad [[Dream|dream]]. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.

A [[Remove Curse|remove curse]] or [[Greater Restoration|greater restoration]] spell cast on the target restores the creature’s true memory.

**43 Bumgurgle's Extract of Smoke - [[Gaseous Form]]**

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [[Gaseous Form|gaseous form]] spell for 1 hour (no [[Concentration|concentration]] required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. This potion's container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.

**44 True Death's Delay - [[Gentle Repose]]**

You touch a corpse or other remains. For the [[4 - Duration|duration]], the target is protected from decay and can’t become undead. The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence o f this spell don’t count against the time limit o f spells such as [[Raise Dead|raise dead]]. Lasts for 10 days.

**45 Solution of Celerity - [[Haste]]**

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target’s speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity [[6 - Saving Throws|saving throws]], and it gains an additional action on each o f its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. When the spell ends, the target can’t move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave o f lethargy sweeps over it. Lasts for 1 minute.

**46 Liren's Draught of the Hero - [[Heroism]]**

For 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. For the same [[4 - Duration|duration]], you are under the effect of the [[Bless|bless]] spell (no [[Concentration|concentration]] required). This blue potion bubbles and steams as if boiling.

**47 Concentrate of Cunning - Increase Wisdom**

[[Owl]]'s Wisdom: The target has advantage on Wisdom checks. 1 hour

**48 Concoction of the Clandestine - [[Invisibility]]**

This potion's container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become [[Invisible|invisible]] for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is [[Invisible|invisible]] with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.

**49 Air [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items for Dungeons & Dragons 5e SRD/Ladder]] - Levitation**

One creature or object of your choice that you can see within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains suspended there for the [[4 - Duration|duration]]. The spell can [[Levitate|levitate]] a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it w ere climbing. You can change the target’s altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the target, you can move up or down as part of your move. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spell’s range.

When the potion ends, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft. [[4 - Duration|Duration]]: up to 10 minutes

**50 Liquid Limbs - Liquid Form**

**51 Finding Formula - [[Locate Object]]**

Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the direction to the object’s location, as long as that object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its [[2 - Movement|movement]].

The spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up close—within 30 feet—at least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.

This spell can’t locate an object if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.

**52 Nyx's Philter of Infatuation - Love Potion**

**53 [[Cat]]'s Eye - Low [[Light]] Vision**

**54 Merikal's Hideaway - Non-Detection**

For the [[4 - Duration|duration]], you hide a target that you touch from [[Divination|divination]] magic. The target can be a w illing creature or a place or an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can’t be targeted by any [[Divination|divination]] magic or perceived through magical [[Scrying|scrying]] sensors. [[4 - Duration|Duration]]: 8 hours

**55 Gardener's [[Charmed|Charm]] - Plant Shape**

**56 Beldaraan's Mixture of Mimicry - [[Polymorph]]**

[[4 - Duration|Duration]]: up to 1 hour

This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form. An unwilling creature must make a W isdom saving throw to avoid the effect. A shapechanger automatically succeeds on this saving throw.

The transformation lasts for the [[4 - Duration|duration]], or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or the target’s level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points o f its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t [[Enlarge_Reduce|reduce]] the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked [[Unconscious|unconscious]].

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast [[PHB - Spells|spells]], or take any other action that requires hands or speech.

The target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its [[Chapter 5 - Equipment|equipment]].

**57 Elyk's Elixir of Enmity - Protection from Evil/Good**

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can’t be [[Charmed|charmed]], [[Frightened|frightened]], or p os sessed by them. If the target is already [[Charmed|charmed]], [[Frightened|frightened]], or p ossessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.

Lasts 10 minutes.

**58 Clear Sight - [[See Invisibility]]**

For the [[4 - Duration|duration]], you see [[Invisible|invisible]] creatures and objects as if they were visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal creatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent. [[4 - Duration|Duration]]: 1 hour

**59 Shadowfoot - Shadowwalk**

**60 Trumpet Tongue - Shout**

**61 Draught of Diminishing - Shrink/Diminuation Person**

When you drink this potion, you gain the "[[Enlarge_Reduce|reduce]]" effect of the [[Enlarge_Reduce|enlarge/reduce]] spell for `dice: 1d4` hours (no [[Concentration|concentration]] required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the [[Bottle|bottle]] fails to interrupt this process.

**62 Fizalisorn's Sweet Slumber - [[Sleep]]**

**63 Beast Tongue - [[Speak with Animals]]**

When you drink this potion, you can cast the [[Animal Friendship|animal friendship]] spell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will. Agitating this muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird tongue, a [[Cat|cat]] claw, or a squirrel hair.

**64 Bone Tongue - Speak with Dead**

You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still have a mouth and can’t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the target o f this spell within the last 10 days. Until the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the corpse is under no [[Compulsion|compulsion]] to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t return the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend anything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about future events.

**65 Tree Tongue - [[Speak with Plants]]**

You imbue plants within 30 feet o f you with limited sentience and animation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in the spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.

You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the [[4 - Duration|duration]]. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain that lasts for the [[4 - Duration|duration]], causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for example.

Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the DM’s discretion. The spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot themselves and move about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.

If a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a [[Common|common]] language, but you gain no magical ability to influence it.

This spell can cause the plants created by the [[Entangle|entangle]] spell to release a restrained creature.

**Creature**. You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. Make an ability check with your [[Chapter 10 - Spellcasting|spellcasting]] ability contested by the creature’s Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range o f this spell.

On subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.

If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must make an ability check with your [[Chapter 10 - Spellcasting|spellcasting]] ability contested by that creature’s Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.

You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a [[Vial|vial]].

**71 Mindspeak - [[Telepathy]]**

You create a telepathic link between yourself and a willing creature with which you are familiar. The creature can be anywhere on the same plane of existence as you. The spell ends if you or the target are no longer on the same plane.

Until the spell ends, you and the target can instantaneously share words, images, sounds, and other sensory messages with one another through the link, and the target recognizes you as the creature it is communicating with.
