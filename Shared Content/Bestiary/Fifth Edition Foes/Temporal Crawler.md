## Special Traits
**Foresight:** A temporal crawler can see a few seconds into the future. This ability prevents a temporal crawler from ever being surprised and grants it an AC bonus equal to its Wisdom modifier (already factored into its AC). In addition, attackers never gain tactical advantage or bonus damage against it from the presence of nearby allies.

**Immunity to Temporal Magic:** Temporal crawlers are unaffected by magic that alters or manipulates time in any way.

**Slowing Webs:** Creatures other than temporal crawlers that are within 10 feet of the webbing in a temporal crawlers lair must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or uffer the effects of a slow spell. The slowing effect ends `dice: 1d4` rounds after the creature leaves the affected area.

**Webbing Trap (1/Day):** The approach to a temporal crawler lair usually is trapped by a concealed net of webbing. The trap, which covers a 20-foot-by-20-foot area, can be spotted with a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check. Each creature entering the trapped area has a 1-in-3 chance to set it off. When the trap is triggered, the webbing drops and each creature in the trapped area must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained. A restrained creature can escape by using an action to make a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check. Alternatively, the webs restraining one creature can be destroyed by 10 points of slashing or fire damage (AC 10).

## Actions
**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d6+3`) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (`dice: 1d6`) poison damage and be paralyzed for a number of rounds equal to the poison damage.

**Webs (Recharge 5—6):** *Ranged Attack:* automatic hit, range 50 ft., one creature. Hit: the target must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained. A restrained creature can escape by using an action to make a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check. Alternatively, the restraining webs can be destroyed by 10 points of slashing or fire damage (AC 10).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Elemental Plane of Time, any land

**Organization**: Solitary or cluster (2–5)

## Description
Temporal crawlers are man-sized spiders from the distant and littleknown Elemental Plane of Time. How and why they first came to the Material Plane is unknown; some sages believe they jumped through a portal opened by a time elemental.

These carnivorous aberrations prey on the flesh of intelligent creatures. They build their well-hidden lairs near populated areas where the food supply is plentiful. They can be found in the decaying slums and sewers of large, old cities, along remote stretches of well-traveled caravan routes, near lawless boom-towns of all sorts, and anywhere else that people can disappear without causing much alarm or triggering a well-organized search.

Because of their manner of hunting, their distant origins, the magical nature of their lairs, and their deep, piercing eyes, it is easy for victims to conclude that these creatures are more intelligent than they are. Sadly, all efforts to communicate with them have met with failure, and scholars have concluded that they are not reticent geniuses but just very clever beasts.

The silver hourglass-shaped marking on a temporal crawler’s back is animated: sand actually appears to flow from one chamber to the other. If a temporal crawler is slain, the marking fades and the “sand” stops flowing.
