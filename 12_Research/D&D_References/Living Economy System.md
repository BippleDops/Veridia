# Living Economy System

## Core Concept
Prices, availability, and demand shift session-to-session based on events, faction control, and Convergence weather. Use lightweight clocks and modifiers to keep it fast at the table.

## Market State Clock (0–6)
- 0–1: Stable. Prices -10% on staples, +10% on rarities.
- 2–3: Tense. Prices normal; rumor trades common.
- 4–5: Volatile. Prices +10% across the board; black market adds 1d4 items.
- 6: Crisis. Prices +25%; legal supply constricts; smuggling checks at advantage.

Advance one tick when: major route disrupted, scandal revealed, shard power spikes, war escalates. Reduce one tick when: truce holds a week, cure stabilizes, guardian pact honored.

## Dynamic Pricing
- Base price × (1 + modifier). Modifier by state: Stable -0.1, Tense 0, Volatile +0.1, Crisis +0.25.
- Faction control modifiers: Pearl Guard -5% on legal goods, +15% on contraband; Syndicate +10% on all, but inventory +2 items; Verdant Accord +5% on food/living goods, -10% on weapons.

## Trade Route Disruptions
- Each route has a Reliability score (0–3). On travel completion, roll d6 ≤ Reliability to avoid disruption. Failure: raise local Market State by 1 and generate a rumor.

## Supply/Demand Mechanics
- Each location tracks a 3-slot inventory list for staples, tools, and curios.
- On session start, roll 1d6 per slot: 1–2 scarce (price +10%), 3–4 normal, 5–6 surplus (price -10%).

## Economic Warfare (Factions)
- Sabotage: Reduce rival Reliability by 1 for a week; on a failed attempt, you’re spotted but gain a whistleblower contact.
- Sanction: Increase rival prices +10% in their hub for a week; on a miss, reputation drops by 1 but black market gains +1 inventory.

## Player Market Manipulation
- Cornering: Buy out a category; raises state by 1 for two sessions in that region.
- Information: Spend 50 gp in drinks and tips to learn next session’s surplus category.
- Arbitrage: Move goods across a state boundary; profit = 10% × value per step of difference.

## At the Table: Quick Procedure
1) Set or adjust Market State.
2) Roll availability for 3 slots.
3) Apply faction control mods.
4) Offer one rumor tied to a route or shard event.

## Adventure Hooks

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
