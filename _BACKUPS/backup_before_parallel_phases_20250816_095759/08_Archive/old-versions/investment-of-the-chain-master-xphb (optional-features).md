*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 156* **Prerequisite**: Level 5 Warlock When you cast [[find-familiar-xphb (spells), you infuse the summoned familiar with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the following benefits. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Aerial or Aquatic The familiar gains either a [Fly Speed Xphb]] or a [[swim-speed-xphb (variant-rules) (your choice) of 40 feet. ## Quick Attack As a [Action Xphb]], you can command the familiar to take the [[actions#Attack|Attack action. ## Necrotic or Radiant Damage Whenever the familiar deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can make it deal Necrotic or Radiant damage instead. ## Your Save DC If the familiar forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC. ## Resistance When the familiar takes damage, you can take a [reaction-xphb (variant-rules)]] to grant it [[boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats)]] against that damage. ## Player-Facing Summary Investment of the chain master xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of investment of the chain master xphb as a nexus where past and present converge.
