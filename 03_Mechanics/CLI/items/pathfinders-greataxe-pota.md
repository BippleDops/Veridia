# Pathfinder's Greataxe
*Weapon ([greataxe](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/greataxe-xphb.md))*  


- **Damage**: 1d12 slashing
- **Properties**: [Heavy](/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Two-Handed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)
- **Weight**: 7.0 lbs.

When you wield this +1 greataxe, you always know the way to the nearest passage leading from underground toward the surface, as well as the approximate depth the axe is underground.
