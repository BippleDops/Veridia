## Cambion

*Mortal Infused with Fiendish Might*

- **Habitat.** Any  
- **Treasure.** Relics  

Cambions are former mortals corrupted by fiendish power or possessed by insidious forces. While tieflings are free-willed individuals with a hint of fiendish ancestry, cambions are inherently tied to or remade by the wicked magic of the Lower Planes.

Many cambions serve the malevolent forces that are the source of their powers. Others seek to claim the might of whatever created them or to seize otherworldly powers of their own. Among the most notorious of such cambions is Iuz, a villain who became an evil demigod and whose villainous nation threatens the Free City of Greyhawk on Oerth.

Cambions come into being in disparate ways. Roll on or choose a result from the Cambion Origins table to determine the source of a cambion's fiendish might.
