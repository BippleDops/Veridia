## DM Notes

Marina works best as a complex ally who provides access to impossible locations and unique perspectives. Her ongoing transformation creates natural tension - she's invaluable but increasingly alien. Use her deep-sea knowledge to drive exploration-based adventures while exploring themes of belonging, transformation, and the cost of being special. Her connection to [[The Deep Mother]] can serve as a hook for cosmic horror or divine favor depending on campaign tone.
