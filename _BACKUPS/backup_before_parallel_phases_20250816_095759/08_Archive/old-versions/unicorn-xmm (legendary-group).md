_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_ The region containing a unicorn's lair is changed by its presence, creating the following effects: - **Obscuring Foliage.** The unicorn and its allies have [[Advantage Xphb on Dexterity ([skills#Stealth|Stealth]]) checks while within 1 mile of the lair. - **Positive Energy.** Whenever a creature within 1 mile of the lair regains [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules) from a spell, it regains the maximum number of [hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] possible. Additionally, the effects of curses are suppressed within 1 mile of the lair. If the unicorn dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. ## Player-Facing Summary Unicorn xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of unicorn xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around unicorn xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Alliance - Achieve immortality ## Plot Hooks - Strange sightings suggest a portal
