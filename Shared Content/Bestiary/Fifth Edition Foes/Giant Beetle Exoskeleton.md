## Description
Giant beetle exoskeletons are animated by secret necromantic magic quite different from that used in the standard animate dead spell. In the process, magical runes are etched onto the dead creatureâ€™s husk which give them great staying power in the face of clerics who would turn them as undead. These same runes give giant beetle exoskeletons resistance to all piercing and slashing damage, including that from magical weapons.

In a few cases, the necromancer responsible for creating one of these creatures altered the process so that the exoskeleton remained empty inside instead of filling with poisonous vapor. It could then be carpeted and cushioned to become a comfortable, if somewhat slow-moving, vehicle for traveling across rugged or dreary terrain.
