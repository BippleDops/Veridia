# Arcane Eye
*4th-level, Divination*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create an [Invisible](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Invisible), invulnerable eye within range that hovers for the duration. You mentally receive visual information from the eye, which can see in every direction. It also has [Darkvision](/03_Mechanics/CLI/senses.md#Darkvision) with a range of 30 feet.

As a [Bonus Action](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction. A solid barrier blocks the eye's movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as 1 inch in diameter.
