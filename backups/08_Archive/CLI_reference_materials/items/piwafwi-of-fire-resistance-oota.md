# Piwafwi of Fire Resistance
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  



This dark spider silk cloak is made by [drow](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/priest-acolyte-xmm.md). It is a [cloak of elvenkind](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/cloak-of-elvenkind-xdmg.md). It also grants resistance to fire damage while you wear it. It loses its magic if exposed to sunlight for 1 hour without interruption.

While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom ([Perception](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Perception)) checks made to see you have disadvantage. and you have advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide, as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
