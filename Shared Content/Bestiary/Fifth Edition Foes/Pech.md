## Special Traits
**Earthbound:** A pech has tactical disadvantage on attack rolls against targets that are entirely surrounded by an element other than earth; i.e., foes that are flying or swimming.

**Light Blindness:** A pech has tactical disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks in bright light.

**Spell-like Abilities:** A pech can use the following spell-like abilities, using Wisdom as its casting ability (DC 11, attack +3). The pech doesn’t need material components to use these abilities.

- 4/day: *stone shape, speak with stone (functions identically to speak with plants, but with stones instead)*

A pech can also use the following spell-like abilities as part of a group. All members of the group must be within 20 feet of all other members of the group, and all must use an action simultaneously to trigger the spell-like effect. An individual pech can use each ability once per day. Only one pech needs to maintain concentration to keep an effect ongoing.

- 4 pechs: *wall of stone*

- 8 pechs: *greater restoration (only to remove petrification)*

**Stone Knowledge:** A pech's extensive knowledge of stone gives it tactical advantage on attack rolls against creatures made of stone, earth, or clay.

## Description
A pech is a fey creature believed to have its origins on the Elemental Plane of Earth. On the Material Plane, peches dwell deep underground in places rarely seen even by dwarves, drow, or other subterranean races.

They are unexcelled as stonemasons, a talent that leads to them sometimes being employed by other subterranean races for their skill at stoneworking. Peches seek isolation for their lairs, however, and their skill at stonecarving lets them blend their dwellings into the natural surroundings so perfectly that they are almost impossible to find.

Peches never wear armor; most are arrayed in nothing more than a simple leather apron or a loincloth of brown or black fur. Peches speak Terran as their primary language, but a few in any group will also be able to communicate in Undercommon or, much more rarely, Common.

Peches are a peaceful folk. They avoid combat and hostile encounters if possible. If they are forced to fight, peches rely on their picks and their magic to dispatch opponents or to escape. Their favorite trick is to cooperate in rapidly erecting a wall of stone around attackers to trap them, or across a narrow tunnel to prevent pursuit as the peches and their families escape into the caverns they know perfectly.
