# Orcsplitter
*Weapon ([greataxe](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/greataxe-xphb.md)), legendary (requires attunement by a dwarf, fighter, or paladin of good alignment)*  


- **Damage**: 1d12 slashing
- **Properties**: [Heavy](/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Two-Handed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)
- **Weight**: 7.0 lbs.

A mighty axe wielded long ago by the dwarf king Torhild Flametongue, Orcsplitter is a battered weapon that appears unremarkable at first glance. Its head is graven with the Dwarvish runes for "orc," but the runes are depicted with a gap or slash through the markings; the word "orc" is literally split in two.

You gain the following benefits while holding this magic weapon:

- You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.  
- When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon against an [orc](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/tough-xmm.md), that [orc](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/tough-xmm.md) must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.  
- You can't be [surprised](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Surprised) by [orcs](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/tough-xmm.md) while you're not [incapacitated](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Incapacitated). You are also aware when [orcs](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/tough-xmm.md) are within 120 feet of you and aren't behind total cover, although you don't know their location.  
- You and any of your friends within 30 feet of you can't be [frightened](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Frightened) while you're not [incapacitated](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Incapacitated).  

## Sentience

Orcsplitter is a sentient, lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 6, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 10. It can see and hear out to 120 feet and has [darkvision](/03_Mechanics/CLI/senses.md#Darkvision). It communicates by transmitting emotions to its wielder, although on rare occasions it uses a limited form of telepathy to bring to the wielder's mind a couplet or stanza of ancient Dwarvish verse.

## Personality

Orcsplitter is grim, taciturn, and inflexible. It knows little more than the desire to face [orcs](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/tough-xmm.md) in battle and serve a courageous, just wielder. It disdains cowards and any form of duplicity, deception, or disloyalty. The weapon's purpose is to defend dwarves and to serve as a symbol of dwarven resolve. It hates the traditional foes of dwarves—giants, goblins, and, most of all, [orcs](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/tough-xmm.md)—and silently urges its possessor to meet such creatures in battle.
