Frequently kept as pets by both the impoverished and well-to-do of Castorhage, these small dogs were originally bred to hunt the rats and other vermin so commonly found in the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]]. They are intelligent and extremely loyal, working well as both trained hunters and family pets. They stand up to 16 inches tall and usually weigh around 14 pounds.
