# Summon Elemental
*4th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (air, a pebble, ash, and water inside a gold-inlaid vial worth 400+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth an Elemental spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the [[elemental-spirit-xphb|Elemental Spirit]] stat block. When you cast the spell, choose an element: Air, Earth, Fire, or Water. The creature resembles a bipedal form wreathed in the chosen element, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your [[initiative xphb|Initiative]] count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [[actions#Dodge|Dodge]] action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.

**Classes**: [[list-spells-classes-druid|Druid]]; [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Fighter (Eldritch Knight)]]; [[list-spells-classes-ranger|Ranger]]; [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]; [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Rogue (Arcane Trickster)]]; [[list-spells-classes-wizard|Wizard]]
