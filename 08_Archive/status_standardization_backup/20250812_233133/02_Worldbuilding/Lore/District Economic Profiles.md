## Player-Facing Summary

District Economic Profiles reveal how location determines opportunity, risk, and survival strategy. Each district offers unique challenges and advantages, creating a complex web of economic relationships that drives both legitimate business and criminal enterprise across both realms.

## Lore Details

Ancient merchants speak of the "Economic Depths" - hidden markets that exist in the spaces between official districts, accessible only to those who understand the true currents of value and exchange. These shadow markets are said to trade in currencies that don't exist in the material world: promises, dreams, and the weight of unspoken obligations.

Deep-sea explorers tell stories of abandoned economic zones, entire districts that were evacuated when the economic calculations that sustained them collapsed. These ghost markets reportedly still operate under automated systems, trading endlessly with no human oversight, creating bizarre price fluctuations that sometimes affect the broader economy.

## Adventure Hooks

- A new district is forming at the intersection of existing economic zones, creating opportunities for investment but also territorial conflicts between established interests
- Economic refugees from a collapsed district seek assistance in establishing new lives, but their arrival threatens to destabilize the existing economic balance
- The party discovers evidence of a long-term economic manipulation scheme designed to impoverish specific districts while enriching others, raising questions about economic justice and intervention

## DM Notes

Use district economics as more than background color - make them active elements that respond to player actions and drive plot development. Different districts offer different types of adventures and moral challenges, allowing players to choose their preferred style of economic engagement.

Consider how economic inequality between districts creates social tension and political instability. Player characters with different district backgrounds may have very different perspectives on economic issues, creating role-playing opportunities and moral conflicts.

The interconnected nature of district economies means that actions in one area can have far-reaching consequences, allowing creative players to achieve goals through indirect economic manipulation rather than direct confrontation.
