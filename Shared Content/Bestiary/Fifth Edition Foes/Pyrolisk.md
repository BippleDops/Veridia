## Special Traits
**Pyrotechnics (1/Day):** As an action, a pyrolisk can cause an ordinary fire within 120 feet of it to flare into a burst of sparks and light. This burst is so bright that all creatures able to see the fire and within 60 feet of it must make a successful DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded for `dice: 1d4` rounds. Pyrolisks are immune to this effect.

## Actions
**Beak:*** Melee Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (`dice: 1d4+2`) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or burst into flames, taking 3 (`dice: 1d6`) fire damage immediately plus 3 (`dice: 1d6`) fire damage at the start of each of the pyrolisks turns for as long as the flames burn. A creature can extinguish flames on itself or on an adjacent creature by using an action to make a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Survival) check.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate and warm lands, underground

**Organization**: Solitary, flight (2–4), or flock (6–13)

## Description
The pyrolisk closely resembles a cockatrice and is often mistaken for that creature. A character who makes a successful DC 15 Int (Nature) check spots the difference, which lies in the coloration of the pyrolisk’s tail feathers and wings. The pyrolisk has a single red feather in its tail and a reddish tinge to its wings. Otherwise, it appears identical to the cockatrice.

Pyrolisks are attracted to firelight, such as campfires at night and glowing forges in dimly-lit blacksmiths’ shops. If it detects other creatures around the fire, it uses its pyrotechnics ability to blind them before entering the circle of light and attacking. These birds are intelligent enough to take turns causing a fire to flare round after round, guaranteeing that the maximum number of foes are blinded for as long as possible.
