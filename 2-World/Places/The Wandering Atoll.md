# The Wandering Atoll - Freedom's Float

## Overview
The Wandering Atoll is a massive collection of shipwrecks, debris, and grown materials bound together into a floating city that drifts across the surface of [[2-World/Lore/Aquabyssos World Overview|Aquabyssos]]. Home to the [[Free Current]] rebellion and those who refuse to accept the drowned world, it represents the last bastion of surface-dwelling freedom. The atoll never stays in one place, following ancient currents and the will of its mysterious navigation system.

## Districts

### The Crown of Wrecks
Upper level made from the hulls of ancient ships. [[2-World/People/Captain Garrett Stormcutter]] maintains his primary warehouse here, though he publicly denies Free Current connections.

### The Refugee Quarters
Ramshackle housing for those fleeing the depths. [[Harbor Master Luna Freedrift]] assigns spaces and maintains what passes for order.

### The Market of Winds
Open-air market where surface goods and air-breathing equipment are traded. [[Sky Trader Zephyr Windcatcher]] deals in rare surface world connections.

### The Rebellion's Heart
Hidden section where [[Free Current]] leadership meets. [[Commander Typhoon Blackheart]] coordinates resistance operations from a converted submarine.

### The Garden Decks
Floating farms growing surface crops under protective domes. [[Botanist Rose Sundrinker]] maintains the last surface plants in Aquabyssos.

### The Dive Platforms
Lower sections where submarines and diving bells launch. [[Engineer Brass Gearspin]] maintains the equipment that allows surface dwellers to raid the depths.

## Notable Features

### The Navigator's Compass
Massive compass made from pre-drowning materials that somehow guides the atoll's movement. No one understands how it works, but [[Navigator Sage Driftwood]] claims to read its will.

### The Last Lighthouse
Still-functioning lighthouse that burns with undrowning fire. Its light can be seen from impossible distances underwater.

### The Memory Gardens
Collection of preserved scenes from the surface world, maintained as museums/shrines. [[Keeper of the Past, Elderly Morgan]] guards these treasures.

### The Free Seminary
School where children learn about the surface world and train in rebellion tactics. [[Teacher Miranda Hopekeeper]] refuses to let the old ways die.

### The Signal Tower
Communication array that somehow sends messages between the atoll and resistance cells throughout Aquabyssos.
