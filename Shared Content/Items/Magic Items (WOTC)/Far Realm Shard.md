## Description

This writhing crystal is steeped in the warped essence of the Far Realm. As an action, you can attach the shard to a Tiny object (such as a weapon or a piece of jewelry) or detach it. It falls off if your attunement to it ends. You can use the shard as a spellcasting focus while you hold or wear it.

When you use a Metamagic option on a spell while you are holding or wearing the shard, you can cause a slimy tentacle to rip through the fabric of reality and strike one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or take `dice: 3d6` psychic damage and become [[Frightened]] of you until the start of your next turn.
