## Overview

The Tide Turner is both a historical figure and a prophetic ideal - representing the ultimate mastery over oceanic forces and the power to literally "turn the tide" of events through magical manipulation of water currents and tidal energies. Throughout Aquabyssos history, several individuals have claimed or been granted this title, each bringing their own interpretation to the role. The concept encompasses not just magical ability, but the wisdom to use tidal forces for the betterment of all underwater civilizations.

### Ancient Tethyan Prophecies

**The Scroll of Deep Currents (1,247 BGD)**
The earliest mention of the Tide Turner appears in ancient Tethyan religious texts, specifically in the **Scroll of Deep Currents**, discovered in the ruins of the **Temple of Perpetual Tides**:

*"When the deep waters rise to swallow the world, and the children of the surface learn to breathe beneath the waves, there shall come one who speaks the language of the tides. This Turner of the Deep Current shall hold in their hands the rhythm of the ocean's heart, and through their will, the waters shall rise or fall, flow or still, according to the needs of all who dwell within the blue realm."*

**The Seven Signs of Turning**
The prophecy outlines seven signs that will herald the arrival of the true Tide Turner:
1. **Birth During Great Tide**: Born when all major ocean currents align
2. **Command of Pressure**: Natural ability to survive at any depth without magical aid
3. **Tidal Resoce**: Personal biorhythms synchronized with tidal cycles
4. **Current Speech**: Ability to communicate with water elementals and sea spirits
5. **Flow Vision**: Supernatural perception of water currents and their destinations
6. **Depth Wisdom**: Understanding the secret knowledge hidden in ocean trenches
7. **Unity Catalyst**: Power to unite disparate underwater communities and species

### The Deepest Teachings

**The Tidal Mysteries**
According to the **Order of the Eternal Current**, a secretive religious organization, the Tide Turner is not just a person but a cosmic role - someone chosen by the ocean itself to maintain the balance between all aquatic life. The order maintains that the ocean is a conscious entity, and the Tide Turner serves as its voice and hand in the physical world.

**Cyclic Manifestation**
Tethyan scholars theorized that the Tide Turner appears cyclically, roughly every 847 years, corresponding to a grand oceanic cycle where all major currents return to identical positions. Each manifestation addresses the greatest challenge facing oceanic civilization during their era.

### Pelagic the Current-Walker (1,847-1,834 BGD)

**The First Tide Turner**
Pelagic the Current-Walker was the first documented individual to bear the title Tide Turner. During the **War of Dry Lands**, when surface kingdoms attempted to drain parts of the ocean to create new territories, Pelagic rallied the scattered sea peoples and led them in the **Great Rising** - a coordinated effort that created massive tsunamis, repelling the land-dwellers and establishing the ocean's inviolability.

**Achievements:**
- **The Great Rising**: Coordinated tidal waves across three continents
- **Unity of Waters**: First alliance between deep-sea and shallow-water peoples
- **Current Mapping**: Charted the major oceanic circulation patterns
- **Tidal Calendar**: Created the calendar system still used in Aquabyssos
- **Peace of Depths**: Negotiated the first treaty between surface and sea civilizations

**Legacy:**
Pelagic's techniques for large-scale tidal manipulation form the basis of modern **Tidal Engineering**. The **Pelagic Protocols** - his guidelines for ethical use of tidal power - are still taught in Aquabyssos magical academies.

### Abyssal the Deep-Touched (634-589 BGD)

**The Tide Turner of the Deep Places**
During the **Age of Surface Wars**, when surface civilizations were too distracted by conflict to threaten the seas, Abyssal the Deep-Touched focused inward, using tidal mastery to explore the deepest ocean trenches and establish contact with the alien intelligences dwelling there.

**Achievements:**
- **Deep Communion**: First successful communication with **Deep Dweller** entities
- **Pressure Mastery**: Survived at depths no other human had reached
- **Abyssal Gardens**: Created the first deep-sea agricultural systems
- **Trench Navigation**: Mapped the deepest ocean features and their magical properties
- **Deep Knowledge**: Recovered ancient pre-human knowledge from oceanic archives

**Controversy:**
Abyssal's contact with Deep Dwellers changed him fundamentally, and his later years were marked by increasingly alien behavior. Some scholars argue he was corrupted by deep-sea influences, while others maintain he achieved a higher form of consciousness. His final fate remains unknown - he simply vanished into the deepest trench, leaving behind only cryptic writings about "the true current that flows beneath all others."

### Marina the Unifier (234-187 BGD)

**The Tide Turner of Unity**
Marina the Unifier appeared during the **Century of Scattered Currents**, when oceanic peoples had fractured into hundreds of competing tribes and city-states. Using her mastery of tidal forces, she literally reshaped coastlines and current patterns to force cooperation, creating geographical necessities for unity.

**Achievements:**
- **Continental Reshaping**: Altered coastlines to encourage cooperation
- **Current Confederation**: United 347 separate oceanic communities
- **Tidal Communication**: Developed methods for long-distance oceanic messaging
- **Resource Distribution**: Used tidal currents to ensure equitable resource sharing
- **Cultural Synthesis**: Created unified languages and customs among sea peoples

**Methods:**
Marina pioneered **Constructive Tidal Engineering** - using tidal forces to build rather than destroy. Her techniques for creating artificial currents, raising seafloor cities, and establishing resource distribution networks revolutionized oceanic civilization.

**Disappearance:**
Marina vanished at the height of her power, leaving behind a message that she had "joined the eternal current" to prepare for a "greater turning" yet to come. Some believe she still influences ocean currents from beyond, while others think she entered a form of suspended animation to return when needed.

### The Search for the New Tide Turner

**Post-Drowning Expectations**
Following the **Great Drowning** in 1 AGD, many Aquabyssos citizens expected a new Tide Turner to emerge and help rebuild civilization. When no clear candidate appeared, various interpretations developed:

**Distributed Theory**: Some scholars believe the Tide Turner's power was distributed among many individuals rather than concentrated in one person.

**Dormant Prophecy**: Others maintain that the next Tide Turner is waiting for the "correct moment" to reveal themselves.

**Evolved Role**: A third group argues that modern Aquabyssos has evolved beyond needing a single Tide Turner, instead requiring collective tidal mastery.

### Contemporary Claimants

**The Pretender Movement**
Several individuals have claimed to be the prophesied Tide Turner, creating political and religious divisions:

**Captain Tempest Stormcaller (798-832 AGD)**
A naval officer who demonstrated exceptional tidal magic abilities, Tempest gathered a following of thousands before disappearing during a massive storm she was attempting to control. Her supporters believe she sacrificed herself to save Aquabyssos from a catastrophic weather event, while critics argue she was a fraud who lost control of forces beyond her understanding.

**Scholar Depth Currentwise (823-847 AGD)**
A academic researcher who claimed to have decoded the "true meaning" of the ancient prophecies, Depth attempted to fulfill the role through intellectual study rather than magical power. Their followers, known as **Theoretical Turners**, believe that understanding tidal forces is more important than controlling them. Depth disappeared while researching in the **Deep Archives**, leaving behind extensive notes about "the mathematics of current convergence."

**Mystic Flow (812-Present)**
A enigmatic figure who appears randomly throughout Aquabyssos, demonstrating remarkable tidal abilities before vanishing again. Flow has never claimed to be the Tide Turner but displays many prophetic abilities. They communicate only through water-based symbols and seem to exist partially outside normal time flow.

### The Council of Depths' Position

**Official Stance**
The **Council of Depths** maintains careful neutrality regarding Tide Turner claimants, stating that "the ocean will make its choice known when the time is right."

*"Before the True Turner comes to heal the depths, a False Turner shall arise to corrupt the flow. They shall speak with the voice of the deep places, promising power and knowledge, but their touch shall turn sweet water bitter and still the life-giving current. Only when the False Turner's corruption threatens to poison all the waters shall the True Turner be revealed, bearing the power to purify what has been defiled."*

**The Final Tide**
*"The last Tide Turner shall not come to rule but to sacrifice. When the waters themselves are dying and the great currents slow to stillness, one shall give their life to become the eternal current, preserving the flow for all future generations.

The characters must investigate their claims while navigating the political and religious implications of potentially opposing a genuine Tide Turner or exposing a fraud.

### The Corrupted Current

Tidal patterns throughout Aquabyssos have begun acting erratically, and some blame a "corrupted Tide Turner" who is deliberately disrupting natural flows. The characters must investigate these disturbances while dealing with the environmental and social chaos they create.

### The Deep Archive Expedition

An ancient archive containing complete information about the Tide Turner prophecies has been discovered in the deepest ocean trenches. The characters must mount a dangerous expedition to retrieve this knowledge while competing with other factions who want to control or destroy it.

### The Bloodline Hunt

Genetic research has identified potential descendants of historical Tide Turners, and various factions are attempting to locate and control these individuals. The characters become involved in protecting or investigating these potential candidates while navigating complex political and ethical issues.
