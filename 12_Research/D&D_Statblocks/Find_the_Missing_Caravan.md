## Quest Overview
Gareth Ironforge's monthly shipment of rare star-iron ore has gone missing along the Tradeway Road. The caravan was due three days ago, and he fears the worst. Without this ore, he cannot complete the town guard's weapon order.

## Quest Giver
**NPC:** [[Gareth_Ironforge|02 Worldbuilding/People/Gareth Ironforge]]
**Location:** [[Market_District|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Market District]] - Ironforge Smithy
**Motivation:** Needs the ore for important commissions and maintaining reputation

## Prerequisites
None - This is an introductory quest

## Potential Complications
1. Weather turns bad, making tracking difficult
2. Rival adventuring party also seeking the reward
3. Bandits have moved the ore to multiple locations

### Opening Hook
Gareth Ironforge approaches the party in his smithy, visibly worried. Tools lie scattered on his workbench, and several half-finished weapons await completion. The smell of cold forge-fire fills the air as he explains his predicament.

*"I've been the town's primary weaponsmith for twenty years, and I've never missed a deadline. But without that star-iron ore, the guard's weapons will remain unfinished, leaving our defenses compromised. I fear something terrible has happened to Dolrim and his men."*

#### Questioning Witnesses
**Traveling Merchant Finn** (Found at The Copper Cup Tavern)
- Witnessed black smoke rising from the forest near Ambush Point three days ago
- Heard sounds of combat and screaming around midday
- Saw riders fleeing toward the Thornwood Hills
- Mentions seeing unfamiliar faces in town recently, asking about caravan schedules

**Stable Master Eckhart**
- Dolrim's horses were well-rested and in excellent condition
- Caravan guards seemed experienced and well-equipped
- Someone asked about Dolrim's departure time the night before he left
- The questioner paid gold for the information and left immediately

#### Travel Encounter (Random Roll 1d6)
1-2: **Desperate Refugees** - Family fleeing bandit raids, seeking protection
3-4: **Rival Merchants** - Competitors hoping to fill Gareth's contracts if the party fails
5-6: **Bandit Scouts** - Two scouts observing the road for potential targets

#### Ambush Point Investigation
**Location**: A narrow section of Tradeway Road between dense forest and a steep cliff

**Evidence Available (Investigation DC varies):**
- **DC 10**: Clear signs of struggle, broken weapons, bloodstains
- **DC 13**: Wagon wheel tracks leading into the forest
- **DC 15**: Specific arrowhead fragments from northern-made crossbows
- **DC 18**: Hidden cache containing one crate of star-iron ore (overlooked by bandits)
- **DC 20**: Distinctive boot prints matching those of a town insider

**Combat Encounter**: **Scavenger Pack**
*2-4 wolves (depending on party size) attracted by the scent of blood*

**Environmental Hazards**:
- **Unstable cliff edge**: Dexterity save (DC 13) to avoid 2d6 falling damage
- **Hidden pit trap**: Perception DC 16 to notice, Dexterity save DC 15 to avoid 1d6 piercing damage

### Key Discoveries
1. **The Betrayal**: Evidence suggests someone in town provided information about the caravan's timing
2. **Professional Operation**: The ambush was well-planned and executed by experienced bandits
3. **Survivors Taken**: Tracks suggest at least one person was captured alive

5. **Woodland Sprites**: Offer help in exchange for a favor
6. **Abandoned Camp**: Recently used by someone other than the bandits
7. **Rockslide**: Dexterity saves required, possible alternate route
8. **Bandit Supply Cache**: Hidden supplies and additional equipment
