# Black Dragon Scale Mail
*Medium armor ([[Scale Mail Xphb]]), very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/dragon-scale-mail.webp#right)

- **Armor Class**: 14 + Dex modifier (max of +2)
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 45.0 lbs.

Dragon Scale Mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them. Other times, hunters carefully preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, Dragon Scale Mail is highly valued.

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to [[armor-class-xphb (variant-rules)]], you have [[Advantage Xphb]] on saving throws against the breath weapons of Dragons, and you have [[boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats)]] to acid damage.

Additionally, you can focus your senses as a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to discern the distance and direction to the closest black dragon within 30 miles of yourself. This action can't be used again until the next dawn.
