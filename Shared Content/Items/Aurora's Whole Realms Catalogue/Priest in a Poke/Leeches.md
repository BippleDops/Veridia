### Leeches (Pic)

## Description
What a medicine cannot cure a good leech sometimes can. We sell live leeches by [[Jars|jars]] of approximately 10. Iâ€™ve known leeches to be used for everything from colds to lycanthropy, with unpredictable results throughout. I once traveled with a fellow so chronically ill that he set a leech to nibbling every evening and put it away again every morning. (10 gp/jar)

## Additional Details
10% chance for placebo effect if patient expects cure; worthless against lycanthropy
