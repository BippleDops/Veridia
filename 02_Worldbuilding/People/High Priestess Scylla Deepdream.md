## DM Notes
Scylla represents the alien horror of Aquabyssosâ€”someone who chose transformation and can't understand why others resist. Her temporal abilities make her nearly impossible to surprise or defeat conventionally. She should feel like a force of nature rather than a person, speaking in paradoxes and prophecies that come true in unexpected ways. Her genuine belief that she's saving the world through drowning makes her sympathetic yet terrifying.
