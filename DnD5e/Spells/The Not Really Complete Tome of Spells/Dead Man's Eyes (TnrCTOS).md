# Dead Man's Eyes (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Casting Time**: 1 round

**Range**: Self

**Components**: S, M (two eyeball-sized glass marbles the same color as your own eyes)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
Your eyes become pure black and the pupils reshape themselves into white skulls. Each round, you may choose one humanoid, giant, beast, or monstrosity within 30 feet that you can see and that can see your eyes and force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect based on its current hit points:

♦ 50 hit points or fewer: 4d6 necrotic damage.

♦ 30 hit points or fewer: 8d6 necrotic damage and become blinded for 1 minute.

♦ 10 hit points or fewer: 10d10 necrotic damage and become blinded permanently.

If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is instantly slain.
