# Arcanum Heights

*The Floating Towers of Magical Learning*

## Overview

Suspended high above [[Crystalhaven]] on crystally-powered levitation platforms, Arcanum Heights represents the pinnacle of magical achievement in [[Aethermoor]]. This district of floating towers, aerial bridges, and gravity-defying gardens serves as the premier magical research and education center for the surface world, rivaling even the infamous [[Abyssal Academy]] in the depths of [[Aquabyssos]].

The Heights house the most advanced magical practitioners, dangerous experimental facilities, and the largest collection of pre-[[The Great Drowning|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Drowning]] magical knowledge remaining on the surface. Here, crystal-powered enchantments push the boundaries of what many consider possible, creating both wonders and catastrophes in equal measure.

## Architecture & Layout

### The Floating Towers

Seven major towers hover at different altitudes above Crystalhaven, each dedicated to a school of magical study:

**The Evocation Spire** - Highest tower, dealing with dangerous energy magic
**The Transmutation Cylinder** - Constantly shifting shape and materials
**The Enchantment Dome** - Spherical structure with mind-affecting protections
**The Conjuration Platform** - Open-air facility for summoning research
**The Divination Needle** - Impossibly thin tower reaching toward the stars
**The Necromancy Vault** - Heavily shielded underground facility (technically part of Heights district)
**The Abjuration Fortress** - Central defensive structure protecting all others

### Connecting Infrastructure

**Crystal Bridges**: Solid light constructs linking towers, requiring magical authorization to cross
**Levitation Platforms**: Public transportation between towers and ground level
**The Ethereal Lifts**: Specialized transport for moving dangerous materials
**Emergency Descent Fields**: Magical safety nets in case of platform failure

### Ground-Level Facilities

**The Applicant Plaza**: Where aspiring mages demonstrate worthiness
**The Materials Market**: Specialized shops for rare magical components
