# The Shadow Surgeons

*"Where light fails to heal, shadow mends what should not be broken." - Chief Surgeon Mortis Voidcut*

## Overview
The Shadow Surgeons operate as an underground medical organization specializing in procedures deemed too dangerous, experimental, or ethically questionable for legitimate practitioners. Working from hidden clinics throughout Aquabyssos's darker districts, they offer services ranging from illegal enhancements to life-saving operations rejected by conventional medicine. Their motto "Any Life, Any Price" reflects their willingness to attempt procedures others won't consider.

Established by exiled medical professionals and self-taught practitioners, the organization fills a crucial niche for those who cannot access or afford traditional healing. However, their methods often involve dark magic, forbidden techniques, and morally ambiguous practices that blur the line between healing and harm.
