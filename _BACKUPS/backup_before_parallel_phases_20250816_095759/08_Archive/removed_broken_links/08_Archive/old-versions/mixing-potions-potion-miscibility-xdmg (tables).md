--- # Mixing Potions; Potion Miscibility

*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 216* **Potion Miscibility**`dice: [](mixing-potions-potion-miscibility-xdmg.md#^potion-miscibility)`| dice: `dice: 1d100` | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| 01 | Both potions lose their effects, and the mixture creates a magical explosion in a 5-foot-radius [[Area of Effect Xphb centered on itself. Each creature in that area takes``dice: 4d10``Force damage. |
| 02â€“08 | Both potions lose their effects, and the mixture becomes an ingested poison of your choice (see ""Poison"" in "chapter 3"). |
| 09â€“15 | Both potions lose their effects. |
| 16â€“25 | One potion loses its effect. |
| 26â€“35 | Both potions work, but with their numerical effects and durations halved. If a potion has no numerical effect and no duration, it instead loses its effect. |
| 36â€“90 | Both potions work normally. |
| 91â€“99 | Both potions work, but the numerical effects and duration of one potion are doubled. If neither potion has anything to double in this way, they work normally. |
| 00 | Only one potion works, but its effects are permanent. Choose the simplest effect to make permanent or the one that seems the most fun. For example, a [Potion of Healing Xdmg]] might increase the drinker's Hit Point maximum by``dice: 2d4` + 2`, or a [[potion-of-invisibility-xdmg (items) might give the drinker the [conditions#Invisible|Invisible]] condition indefinitely. At your discretion, a [[dispel-magic-xphb (spells)]] spell or similar magic might end this lasting effect. |
