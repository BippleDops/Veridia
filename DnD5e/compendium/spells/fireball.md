# Fireball
*3rd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

**Classes**: Artificer (Artillerist), Cleric (Light), Cleric (Zeal (PSA)), Fighter (Eldritch Knight), Monk (Four Elements), Sorcerer, Warlock (Fiend), Warlock (Genie), Wizard
