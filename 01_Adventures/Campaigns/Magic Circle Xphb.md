--- # Magic Circle

*3rd-level, Abjuration* - **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (salt and powdered silver worth 100+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 1 hour You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall [[Area of Effect Xphb]] of magical energy centered on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear wherever the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] intersects with the floor or other surface. Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways: - The creature can't willingly enter the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw. - The creature has [[Advantage Xphb]] on attack rolls against targets within the [[Area of Effect Xphb]]. - Targets within the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] can't be possessed by or gain the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] or [[conditions#frightened|Frightened]] condition from the creature. Each time you cast this spell, you can cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] and protecting targets outside it. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The duration increases by 1 hour for each spell slot level above 3. **Classes**: [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 293.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of magic circle xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around magic circle xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Secret Covenant - Summon ancient evil ## Plot Hooks - A journal reveals the truth about a local noble
