# Ironhold
*The Unbreakable Fortress of the Mountains*

## Overview

Carved into the living rock of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Sundered Peaks]], Ironhold stands as [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s greatest fortress-city and the undisputed center of metalworking, engineering, and industrial production. This ancient stronghold, founded in the First Age by master craftsmen seeking the perfect ore deposits, has evolved into a marvel of defensive architecture and technological innovation that has never fallen to enemy assault.

The city extends both above and below ground, with surface fortifications protecting vast underground complexes that house forges, workshops, living quarters, and the extensive [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Ancient Siege Tunnels|tunnel networks]] that played a crucial role during [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Continental War]].
