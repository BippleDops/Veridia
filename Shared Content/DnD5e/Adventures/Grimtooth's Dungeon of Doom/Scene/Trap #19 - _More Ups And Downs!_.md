# Trap #19 - "More Ups And Downs!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The delvers who don't make it to the pier will have much more fun. As the boat empties of it's occupants and settles down into the glassy depths, the would-be robbers will find themselves clinging like [[Rat (D&D 5e SRD)|rats]] to one or more of the stalagmites, unless they choose to "go down with their ship". (Delvers'll do the darnedest things under pressure.) If this is the case sic some of the [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|water]] dwellers on them.
> 
> Those who are clinging to the stalagmites will feel more than hear the "click" as the [[8 - Traps (D&D 5e SRD)|traps]] here are released. Stalagmites A, B, and D begin to slowly sink into the [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|water]]. This provides an entertaining spectacle as the delvers frantically [[8 - Movement (D&D 5e SRD)|climb]] up the ever thinning stone. More and more delvers, less and less room at the top, reminds me of my old corporate structure. Add at this point a few ghostly white dorsal fins circling and you have true art!
> 
> Eventually the stalagmite will submerge and the party will have to "sink or [[8 - Movement (D&D 5e SRD)|swim]]", chomp, chomp!
> 
> Meanwhile, stalagmites C and E begin to rise. At first this will seem like a blessing. Some of the delvers trapped on A, B, or D may even try to [[8 - Movement (D&D 5e SRD)|swim]] over and join them. It is after all only l0 or 12feet..chomp, chomp! Eventually the sharp point of the stalagmites will [[3 - Weapons (D&D 5e SRD)|reach]] the ceiling. At this point the ceiling is 45 feet above the [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|water]] level. The stalagmite's point will drive itself into the ceiling breaking into the small chambers cleverly placed overhead.
> 
> Stalagmites C and E penetrate rooms filled with particularly slippery, and smelly fish oil. The relatively smooth surface of the stalagmites will soon be covered with the extremely slippery substance. On any given turn there is a 30% chance (L3 ) that the delvers clinging to the rocks will loose their grip. (Please note the ceiling here consists of crumbling limestone formations. Attempts to drive pitons into it will result in collapsing parts of the fragile structure down around the delvers ears, and probably knocking out the bottom of the room overhead.)
> 
> The fish oil will attract predators from miles around in the underground river network. Just what the delvers will need at this point, more company.
> 
> Once again Evinrood seems to be just toying with the hapless tomb robbers, amusing but only worth one skull.

**Pack Piranha**, hordes of ravenous little beasties that can strip an [[Elf (D&D 5e SRD)|elf]] to his ear rings in seconds. (These creatures travel in large groups and should be considered VERY tough.) [[Swarm of Quippers (D&D 5e SRD)|Swarm of Quippers]]

**Albino Cave Sharks**, often over 8 feet long, a ghastly white in color, hunt by motion sensing, so if you [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|fall]] into the [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|water]] remain absolutely still and you will be just [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|food]] ... er ... fine. (These creatures can be found in groups of 3 to 8 (`dice: 1D6+2`) and are individually Tough. If the odds are 3 or 4 to one even superhuman delvers will find themselves in dire straights.) [[Giant Electric Catfish]]

**Electro-Squids**, these cute little fellows pack a wollop that would do justice to a [[Lightning Bolt (D&D 5e SRD)|lightning bolt]]. Being small and relatively feeble they either grab hold of prey and zap it for [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|food]], or in the case of larger [[14 - Monsters (D&D 5e SRD)|monsters]] which gulp them down whole, they zap them into unconsciousness, then nibble their way out! (These guys are not so Lough bul the "electro" can finish off the uninitiated by stunning them. If [[14 - Actions in Combat (D&D 5e SRD)|help]] is not forthcoming, drowning and lunch soon follow.) [[Gloom Crawler]]

**Blind Barricudas**, these creatures travel in schools and are famed for the length of their teeth and their healthy appetites. (Again a style of monster that travels in groups. Not as small or as hard to hit as Piranha or as big, mean and strong as the Sharks these critters can be beaten in combat.) [[Eel Hound (ToB)|Eel Hound]]

**Lastly there can be found the fiendish Crystal Sea Snakes**: they do not travel in large groups, and they are physically fragile. An average warrior can easily kill one in hand to hand combat. However during contact with one of these creatures there is a 40% chance (L4) of being bitten. They are [[17 - Damage and Healing (D&D 5e SRD)|lightning]] fast and their venom is deadly, and works almost instantaneously. (There is a substantial volume of thought that this is one of the few forms of [[17 - Damage and Healing (D&D 5e SRD)|poison]] more virulent than Dragon Venom! Capturing one of these creatures and milking it for venom would be an interesting commercial enterprise, if one were to survive the quick strike capabilities.) [[Isonade (ToB)|Isonade]]
