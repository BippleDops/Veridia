- If complete integration: Heroes transcend dimensional limitations ### [[Echo Dimension [Adventure Hooks]] **[[Ongoing Possibilities**: - Exploration adventures in different echo realities
- Rescue missions to save people trapped between dimensions
- Diplomatic missions to resolve inter-dimensional conflicts
