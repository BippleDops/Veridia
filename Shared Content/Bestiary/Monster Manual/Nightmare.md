## Special Traits
***Confer Fire Resistance.*** The nightmare can grant resistance to fire damage to anyone riding it.

***Illumination.*** The nightmare sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

## Actions
***Hooves.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (`dice: 2d8+4`) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (`dice: 2d6`) fire damage.

***Ethereal Stride.*** The nightmare and up to three willing creatures within 5 feet of it magically enter the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa.

## Description
A nightmare appears in a cloud of roiling smoke, its mane, tail, and hooves wreathed in flame. The creature's unearthly black form moves with supernatural speed, vanishing in a cloud of brimstone as quickly as it appeared.

***Dread Steed.*** Also called a "demon horse" or "hell horse," the nightmare serves as a steed for creatures of exceptional evil, carrying demons, devils, [[Death Knight|death knights]], liches, [[Night Hag|night hags]], and other vile monsters. It resembles a fiendish horse, and a nightmare's fiery red eyes betray its malevolent intelligence. A nightmare can be summoned from the Lower Planes, but unless a worthy sacrifice is offered to it as food upon its arrival, the nightmare displays no special loyalty to the creature it serves.

***Creating a Nightmare.*** Nightmares don't appear naturally in the multiverse. They must be created from pegasi. The ritual that creates a nightmare requires the torturous removal of a [[Pegasus|pegasus]]'s wings, driving that noble creature to evil as it is transformed by dark magic.
