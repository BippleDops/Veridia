# Wand of Fireballs
*Wand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/wand-of-fireballs.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can expend no more than 3 charges to cast [Fireball](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/fireball-xphb.md) (save DC 15) from it. For 1 charge, you cast the level 3 version of the spell. You can increase the spell's level by 1 for each additional charge you expend.

## Regaining Charges

The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll `d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
