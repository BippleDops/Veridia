WHERE world = "Aquabyssos" OR world = "Aethermoor" ## 🎬 Final Thoughts The beauty of the Aquabyssos-Aethermoor connection lies in its flexibility. Whether your players save everyone, doom both worlds, or create something entirely new, the framework supports their choices while maintaining narrative coherence. Remember: In the space between worlds, identity itself becomes fluid. Use this uncertainty to create memorable roleplaying moments and force difficult decisions that have no perfect answers. The merger isn't just about two worlds colliding—it's about what it means to be human when humanity itself is negotiable. > *"In the depths, we discover what rises. On the surface, we learn what sinks. Between them, we choose what remains."*
