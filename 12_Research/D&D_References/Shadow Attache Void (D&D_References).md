## Player-Facing Summary

Shadow Attache Void is a void-touched element of the setting, known for impossible angles and star-silent echoes. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Shadow Attache Void as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Shadow Attache Void.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
