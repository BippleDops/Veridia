## Special Traits
**Swallow:** A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained but no longer grappled. It takes 8 (`dice: 1d8+4`) acid damage automatically at the start of each of the giant catfish's turn. Only one Medium creature or two Small creatures can be inside the giant catfish at one time. A swallowed creature is unaffected by anything happening outside the giant catfish or by attacks from outside it. A swallowed creature can get out of the giant catfish by using 5 feet of movement, but only after the giant catfish is dead.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The giant electric catfish bites once and uses its electricity discharge (if available), or it swallows a grappled creature. It can't bite another target while it has a creature grappled.

**Bite:*** Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (`dice: 1d10+4`) piercing damage and the target is grappled and restrained.

**Swallow:** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +6 to hit, reach 0 ft., one Medium or smaller creature grappled by the giant electric catfish. Hit: 8 (`dice: 1d8+4`) acid damage and the target is swallowed (see above).

**Electricity Discharge (Recharge 6):** A giant electric catfish can generate a pulse of electricity. Every creature within 10 feet of the giant catfish takes `dice: 2d6` points of lightning damage and is stunned until the start of the giant catfish's next turn. A successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw reduces damage to half and negates the stun.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Non-arctic aquatic

**Organization**: Solitary or school (5â€“8)

## Description
Giant electric catfish make their homes beneath submerged logs and in streambed pits where they face upstream with their mouths open, swallowing everything resembling food that tumbles or floats into their toothless maws. They favor dank, dark, slow-moving water with limited visibility. They are nocturnal hunters and venture out a few hours after sunset to hunt.

Giant electric catfish are about 8 feet long but can grow to lengths of 12 feet or more. Their bloated bodies are generally gray or brown in color, fading to a dull white or cream on the underbelly. Their eyes are small and positioned on either side of a wide, round snout. Three sets of barbels (feelers) are located around the mouth. Unlike many fish, a giant electric catfish has no dorsal fin.

Giant electric catfish are territorial, and the defend their realms with great ferocity. Before engaging in combat, when threatened or facing a potential enemy, an electric catfish generates a pulse of crackling electricity in an effort to intimidate or discourage would-be predators. Failing this, the giant electric catfish enters combat and bites its foe.
