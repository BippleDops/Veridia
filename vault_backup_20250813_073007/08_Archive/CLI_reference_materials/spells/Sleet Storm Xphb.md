# Sleet Storm
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature umbrella)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Until the spell ends, sleet falls in a 40-foot-tall, 20-foot-radius [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]] centered on a point you choose within range. The area is [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/heavily-obscured-xphb|Heavily Obscured]], and exposed flames in the area are doused.

Ground in the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]] is [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb|Difficult Terrain]]. When a creature enters the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]] for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Prone|Prone]] condition and lose [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Concentration|Concentration]].
