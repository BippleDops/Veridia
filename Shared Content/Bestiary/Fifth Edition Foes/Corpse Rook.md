## Description
Corpse rooks are giant, three-headed birds of prey that devour anything they can catch. Their preferred diet consists of horses, giant lizards, dire rats, giant frogs, cattle, sheep, and humanoids of all kinds. They build their nests at the tops of sturdy, broadleaved trees, or on high, rocky outcrops in less forested terrain. A corpse rook’s nest is constructed from mud, grass, hair, leaves, and the bones of their victims. These creatures do not associate with other avian creatures. They are often hunted by red and green dragons, rocs, and wyverns, who savor the taste of their flesh.

Corpse rooks are solitary hunters with a hunting territory extending 5 miles in every direction from their nests. Hunting is done during the day. During spring and early summer months (mating season), both male and female corpse rooks hunt for food—sometimes together, but most often they fly off in separate directions from the nest. Creatures killed by a corpse rook are carried back to the nest and either devoured or fed to hatchlings. A nest typically contains `dice: 1d4` silver and gold-flecked eggs (or hatchlings later in the season) along with the chewed and droppingspattered belongings of slain prey.

Corpse rooks attack from the air, slashing with their claws and biting with their sharpened beaks. They rarely land on the ground during battle, preferring to swoop in and out of melee to keep their opponents off balance and limit their vulnerability to melee. Although they generally hunt individually, a lone corpse rook will call for help from others of its kind if it spots a group of delectable prey that it suspects it can’t handle alone. The spotting bird then circles high above the potential victims until more corpse rooks arrive. When working together this way, it’s common for one or two corpse rooks to land and draw the attention of the prey, while others swoop in from multiple directions.
