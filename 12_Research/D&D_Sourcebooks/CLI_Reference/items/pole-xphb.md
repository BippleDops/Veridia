# Pole
*Adventuring gear*  


- **Cost**: 5 cp
- **Weight**: 7.0 lbs.

A Pole is 10 feet long. You can use it to touch something up to 10 feet away. If you must make a Strength ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check as part of a High or [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/long-jump-xphb|Long Jump]], you can use the Pole to vault, giving yourself [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on the check.
