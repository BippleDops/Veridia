## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The adept makes three unarmed strikes or three dart attacks.

***Unarmed Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d8+3`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, the adept can choose one of the following additional effects:

The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or drop one item it is holding (adept's choice).

The target must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the adept's next turn.

***Dart.** Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d4+3`) piercing damage.

## Reactions
***Deflect Missile.*** In response to being hit by a ranged weapon attack, the adept deflects the missile. The damage it takes from the attack is reduced by `dice: 1d10+3`. If the damage is reduced to 0, the adept catches the missile if it's small enough to hold in one hand and the adept has a hand free.

## Description
Martial arts adepts are disciplined monks with extensive training in hand-to-hand combat. Some protect monasteries; others travel the world seeking enlightenment or new forms of combat to master. A few become bodyguards, trading their combat prowess and loyalty for food and lodging.
