--- # Quest - The Pretender's Crown *The Throne of Aethermoor Stands on a Foundation of Lies* ## Quest Giver

- **Name**: Local authority figure
- **Location**: Town center
- **Motivation**: Community safety ## Objectives

### Primary

- Main quest goal ### Optional

- Secondary objectives
- Hidden goals ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Quest Overview A mysterious figure claiming to be the lost heir of [[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde has emerged from the [Crystalline Wastes]], bearing artifacts and knowledge that seem to prove their legitimacy. However, evidence suggests this "heir" may be a construct of shadow magic, a puppet of the [[Shadow Crystal, or something even more sinister. The party must uncover the truth before the coronation legitimizes a false ruler and plunges Aethermoor into darkness. The investigation will lead through the highest echelons of nobility, into forgotten royal vaults, and ultimately to a conspiracy that threatens not just the crown but the very nature of reality in Aethermoor. Every ally could be an enemy, every proof could be fabricated, and the truth itself might be more dangerous than the lie. ### Prince Aurelius Lumengarde

**Public Persona**: The Lost Heir Returned **Apparent Age**: 28 years **Claim**: Son of Queen Seraphina from secret first marriage **Evidence of Legitimacy**:
- Bears the Lumengarde birthmark (crystalline pattern on shoulder)
- Possesses the lost Signet of Storms (missing for 30 years)
- Knows secret royal protocols and passwords
- Can activate bloodline-locked crystal artifacts
- Supported by several noble houses with "recovered memories" **Suspicious Elements**:
- No records of first marriage exist
- Emerged exactly when succession crisis peaked
- Never removes special gloves (hiding something?)
- Reflection sometimes shows different face
- Animals react with fear despite his charm ### The Truth (DM Only) The Pretender is actually:

1. **A Perfect Simulacrum** created by the [Shadow Crystal]] using stolen royal blood and memories
2. **Marina Silversky** in disguise, manipulating events to prevent realm convergence
3. **The Real Heir** but corrupted by shadow during their exile
4. Additionally, **An Ancient Entity** wearing a constructed body, seeking to reclaim power
5. **Multiple Beings** switching places using identical appearances (Choose based on campaign needs or roll d6, rerolling 6) ### The Auditor's Warning

**Location**: Hidden office in [[Port Meridian **Quest Giver**: [The Nameless Auditor]] The Auditor has discovered ficial irregularities suggesting the Pretender's supporters are being paid with gold that doesn't exist—shadow gold that vanishes after 30 days. They need investigators who can work outside official channels. **Initial Tasks**:
1. **Infiltrate Noble Gathering**: Attend Duke Aldridge's ball to observe the Pretender
2. **Investigate Supporters**: Discover why nobles suddenly "remember" the heir
3. **Trace the Gold**: Follow the shadow gold to its source
4. **Test the Birthmark**: Acquire means to verify its authenticity ### The Noble's Ball

**Location**: Duke Aldridge's Crystal Manor **Challenge**: Social infiltration and investigation **Discoveries**:
- Several nobles have new memories that appeared overnight
- The Pretender's reflection in crystal mirrors flickers
- Guards report seeing him in multiple places simultaneously
- A servant whispers about screams from his quarters at night **Key NPCs**:
- **Duke Aldridge**: Primary supporter, possibly mind-controlled
- **Lady Venetia Silverwind**: Skeptical but afraid to speak
- **Court Wizard Aldwin**: Notices magical anomalies but stays silent
- **The Pretender**: Charming, perfect, slightly wrong **Complications**:
- Assassination attempt on the Pretender (staged?)
- Party framed for theft of royal artifact
- Memory modification attempted on investigators
- Shadow creatures attack dissenting nobles ### Royal Archives

**Location**: The Forbidden Wing of the Crystal Palace **Objective**: Find proof of the first marriage or its absence The party must break into the most secure archive in Aethermoor, protected by:
- **Crystal Guardians**: Constructs that detect lies
- **Memory Wards**: Forget why you came if you fail saves
- **Temporal Locks**: Doors that exist in different time periods
- **The Archive Keeper**: Ancient construct with perfect memory **Discoveries**:
- Marriage records have been expertly altered with shadow ink
- Original documents crumble when exposed to light
- Hidden chamber contains Queen's real diary denying first marriage
- Evidence of previous attempts to claim the throne similarly ### The Bloodline Vault

**Location**: Secret chamber beneath the throne room **Objective**: Test the Pretender's blood against the Crown's requirements **The Test Chamber**:
- Ancient crystal formation that glows for royal blood
- Has been modified recently with shadow crystals
- Original test would kill non-royals instantly
- Current version can be fooled with proper preparation **Revelations**:
- The Pretender's blood is partially royal (stolen/cloned?)
- Shadow essence mixed with the blood sample
- Previous failed Pretenders' remains hidden here
- Queen Seraphina knew this would happen (prophetic warning) ### The Memory Market

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Quest The Pretender's Crown as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Quest The Pretender's Crown. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Plot Hooks - An heirloom has gone missing and war looms

- Someone is blackmailing information for revenge
- A document has gone missing and chaos spreads ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## Background
