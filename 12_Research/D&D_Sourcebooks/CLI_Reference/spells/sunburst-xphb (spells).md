# Sunburst
*8th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of sunstone)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot-radius [[sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]] centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in the [[sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]] makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `12d6` Radiant damage and has the [[conditions#Blinded|Blinded]] condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only.

A creature [[conditions#Blinded|Blinded]] by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

This spell dispels [[darkness xphb|Darkness]] in its area that was created by any spell.
