# Ram
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 97*  

A Ram consists of a movable gallery equipped with a heavy log suspended from two roof beams by chains. The log is shod in iron and used to batter through doors and barricades. Positioning a Ram requires three [Utilize](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Utilize) actions. Then a crew member can use the Ram action.

The gallery roof gives the operators [Total Cover](/03_Mechanics/CLI/tables/cover-xphb.md) against attacks and other effects from above.
