# Robe of Stars
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/robe-of-stars.webp#right)


This black or dark-blue robe is embroidered with small white or silver stars. You gain a +1 bonus to saving throws while you wear it.

Six stars, located on the robe's upper-front portion, are particularly large. While wearing this robe, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to remove one of the stars and expend it to cast the level 5 version of [[magic-missile-xphb|Magic Missile]]. Daily at dusk, `d6` removed stars reappear on the robe.

While you wear the robe, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to enter the Astral Plane along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there until you take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to return to the plane you were on. You reappear in the last space you occupied or, if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space.
