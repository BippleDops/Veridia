# Scorpion Armor

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Heavy Armor

**Rarity:** rare

**Attunement**: *requires attunement*

**Weight**: 65 lbs.

## Description

This suit of plate armor is fashioned from [[giant scorpion]] chitin. While wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits:

- The armor improves your combat readiness, granting you a +5 bonus to initiative as long as you aren't [[incapacitated]].

- The armor doesn't impose disadvantage on your Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks.

- The armor doesn't impose disadvantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of extreme heat (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

**Curse** This armor is cursed. Whenever you don or doff it, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 100 (`dice: 10d10 + 45`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Only a [[wish]]  spell can remove the armor's curse.
