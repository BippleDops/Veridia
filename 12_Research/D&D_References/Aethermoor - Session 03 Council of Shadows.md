# Session 3: Council of Shadows

> *"In politics, the deadliest shadows are cast by those claiming to bring light."*

## 🎭 Strong Start
The party is summoned to an emergency council, but arrives to find [[Lord Aurelius Goldwave]] murdered in his study, his body partially crystallized. A Purist Coalition pin is clutched in his dead hand, but the crystal pattern suggests magical assassination. City guards are already trying to arrest a Crimson Hand suspect.

## 🔍 Scenes

## 🎬 Cliffhanger Ending
During the midnight market raid, [[Brother Marcus Steelbane]] arrives frantically. He's made a breakthrough—the plague isn't a disease, it's a transformation preparing hosts for something. As he explains, crystalline veins suddenly spread across his face. He gasps: "The Queen... at the Crystal Festival... seven shards unite... the Drowned God..." before collapsing into crystal stasis. The Festival is in one week.
