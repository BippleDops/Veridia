  "name": "Amphibious"
- "desc": "Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and can see\
    \ the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,\
    \ the creature is [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened)\
    \ for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its\
    \ turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight, ending the effect\
    \ on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect\
    \ ends for it, the creature is immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the\
    \ next 24 hours.\n\nUnless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's\
    \ true form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the initial\
    \ saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature that averts its eyes\
    \ has disadvantage on attack rolls against the hag."

"actions":

- "desc": "The hag targets one [frightened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#frightened)\
    \ creature she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the hag, it\
    \ must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or drop to 0\
    \ hit points."
  "name": "Death Glare"
- "desc": "The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical\
    \ illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature of her general size and humanoid\
    \ shape. The effect ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.\n\
    \nThe changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For\
    \ example, the hag could appear to have no claws, but someone touching her hand\
    \ might feel the claws. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually\
    \ inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence ([Investigation](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/skills.md#Investigation))\
    \ check to discern that the hag is disguised."
