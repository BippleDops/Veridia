## Overview

Economic systems under stress reveal the moral foundations of society. In Aquabyssos, where shadow corruption threatens stability and resources become increasingly scarce, traditional economic relationships break down and communities must grapple with fundamental questions about fairness, merit, need, and survival. This guide explores the complex moral terrain where economic policy meets ethical philosophy.

#### **The Great Rationing Debate**
**Situation**: Food, medicine, and magical components become critically scarce. The Rationing Authority must decide distribution methods.

**Proposed Systems**:

**Equal Distribution**
- **Principle**: Every person receives identical rations
- **Advocates**: Lower classes, egalitarian philosophers
- **Problems**: Ignores different needs (pregt women, laborers, children)
- **Result**: Widespread malnutrition as rations meet no one's actual needs

**Need-Based Distribution**
- **Principle**: Resources allocated by documented necessity
- **Advocates**: Medical professionals, family advocates
- **Problems**: Bureaucratic complexity, potential for fraud
- **Result**: Administrative chaos and corrupt certifications

**Merit-Based Distribution**
- **Principle**: Essential workers receive larger portions
- **Advocates**: Military, infrastructure workers, managers
- **Problems**: Who defines "essential" and how?
- **Result**: Class warfare as groups compete for designation

**Market Distribution**
- **Principle**: Allow prices to rise and let ability to pay determine allocation
- **Advocates**: Merchant guilds, wealthy families
- **Problems**: Poor cannot afford basic survival needs
- **Result**: Social breakdown as hunger drives desperation

**Case Study: The Harbor District Food Crisis**
When plague closes trade routes, Harbor District faces starvation:
- **Dock Workers**: Argue their labor maintains essential trade
- **Families with Children**: Claim children need full rations for development
- **Elderly**: Assert lifetime contributions earn care in crisis
- **Scholars**: Contend research may solve the crisis
- **Wounded Veterans**: Demand support for past military service

**Moral Complexity**: Every system advantages some groups while disadvantaging others. No purely neutral allocation method exists.

#### **The Seizure Authorization Crisis**
**Situation**: Government claims emergency powers to requisition private property for public use. Wealthy families resist while poor communities demand redistribution.

**The Goldcurrent Estate Conflict**
**Property**: Massive estate with food stores, medical supplies, defensible position
**Owner**: Lady Goldcurrent, elderly widow with adult children abroad  
**Government Position**: Property needed for refugee shelter and supply distribution
**Family Position**: Confiscation violates property rights and legal precedent
**Community Position**: Hoarded resources while neighbors starve is immoral

**Stakeholder Perspectives**:
- **Property Rights Advocates**: Seizure destroys legal foundation of society
- **Emergency Authorities**: Crisis requires suspension of normal rules
- **Refugee Families**: Need shelter and food immediately
- **Property Owners**: Fear broader confiscation if precedent set
- **Labor Organizers**: See opportunity for wealth redistribution

**Legal vs. Moral Frameworks**:
- **Legal**: Property rights enshrined in constitutional documents
- **Moral**: Unused resources while people die seems indefensible
- **Practical**: Confiscation might discourage future investment
- **Emergency**: Normal rules don't apply during existential crisis

#### **The Essential Worker Dilemma**
**Situation**: Dangerous work requires higher wages to attract workers, but increased costs might collapse already struggling businesses and raise prices for everyone.

**The Deep Current Mine Conflict**
- **Work**: Crystal mining essential for reality anchors
- **Danger**: 30% casualty rate from shadow corruption exposure
- **Current Wages**: Standard guild rates insufficient to attract workers
- **Proposed Wages**: Triple pay to reflect risks
- **Economic Impact**: Higher costs passed to consumers already struggling
- **Alternative**: Conscripted labor (essentially slavery)

**Worker Perspectives**:
- **Volunteer Workers**: Demand hazard pay commensurate with risk
- **Unemployed**: Desperate for any work but fear the dangers
- **Union Representatives**: Fight for safety equipment and fair wages
- **Family Members**: Torn between income needs and loved ones' safety

**Employer Perspectives**:
- **Mine Owners**: Cannot afford triple wages without government subsidy
- **Guild Masters**: Higher labor costs threaten entire industry
- **Government Officials**: Need crystal production but limited emergency funds
- **Economic Advisors**: Warn wage increases could trigger inflation

**Consumer Impacts**:
- **Poor Families**: Cannot afford higher prices for essential goods
- **Middle Class**: Face choice between safety items and basic needs
- **Elderly**: Fixed incomes inadequate for increased costs
- **Youth**: Future economic opportunities diminished by current crisis

#### **The Underground Economy Moral Web**
**Situation**: Official rationing creates black markets offering better quality goods at premium prices. Law enforcement debates whether to suppress or regulate these markets.

**The Shadow Bazaar Network**
- **Services**: Quality food, medicine, protection, information
- **Customers**: Those who can afford premium prices for reliable goods
- **Vendors**: Risk imprisonment but can support families
- **Quality**: Often better than official rations
- **Price**: 3-10 times official rates

**Moral Positions**:

**Suppress Black Markets**
- **Reasoning**: Illegal activity undermines social cohesion
- **Supporters**: Law enforcement, officials, those dependent on rationing
- **Methods**: Raids, arrests, asset forfeiture
- **Problems**: Drives activity underground, reduces quality

**Regulate Black Markets**
- **Reasoning**: Prohibition doesn't eliminate demand, regulation ensures quality
- **Supporters**: Pragmatic officials, public health advocates
- **Methods**: Licensing, taxation, quality standards
- **Problems**: Legitimizes inequality, undermines official system

**Ignore Black Markets**
- **Reasoning**: Limited enforcement resources better used elsewhere
- **Supporters**: Overwhelmed police, libertarian philosophers
- **Methods**: Selective blindness, informal tolerance
- **Problems**: Appearance of corruption, uncontrolled expansion

**Case Study: The Medicine Dilemma**
A black market dealer offers high-quality healing potions to wealthy families while poor children die from treatable conditions:
- **Dealer**: Claims he's providing service government cannot
- **Wealthy Buyers**: Argue they have right to spend their money
- **Poor Families**: Demand equal access to life-saving treatment
- **Officials**: Torn between enforcing equality and acknowledging reality
- **Healers**: Some secretly work with dealers to help patients

#### **The Emergency Revenue Crisis**
**Situation**: Government needs massive funding for emergency response but economic collapse makes traditional taxation inadequate. Various emergency tax proposals create intense debate.

**Proposed Emergency Taxes**:

**Wealth Tax**
- **Target**: Assets above certain threshold
- **Rate**: 5-15% annually on net worth
- **Supporters**: Working class, progressive politicians
- **Opposition**: Property owners, business leaders
- **Problems**: Asset valuation difficulties, capital flight

**Shadow Tax**  
- **Target**: Those who benefit from shadow transformation
- **Rate**: Varies by degree of enhancement
- **Supporters**: Unaltered humans, traditional religious groups
- **Opposition**: Shadow-touched community, transformation advocates
- **Problems**: Discrimination, enforcement difficulties

**Crisis Profits Tax**
- **Target**: Businesses profiting during emergency
- **Rate**: 50-90% on "excess" profits
- **Supporters**: Consumer advocates, anti-profiteering groups
- **Opposition**: Business community, economic advisors
- **Problems**: Defining "excess," discouraging investment

**Service Tax**
- **Target**: All citizens required to provide labor or money
- **Rate**: 20 hours/week service or equivalent payment
- **Supporters**: Military, infrastructure managers
- **Opposition**: Individual rights advocates, disabled community
- **Problems**: Enforcement, fairness to different abilities

#### **The Trade Sanctions Debate**
**Situation**: Foreign nations request trade sanctions against regions with high cult infiltration. Sanctions would harm innocent civilians while pressuring governments.

**The Deepmoor Sanctions Question**
- **Target**: Deepmoor region suspected of harboring cult cells
- **Proposed Measures**: Ban on food, medicine, technology exports
- **Goal**: Pressure regional government to crack down on cult activity
- **Civilian Impact**: Food shortages, medical supply crisis, economic collapse

**Moral Framework Conflicts**:
- **Collective Responsibility**: Should communities bear consequences for members' actions?
- **Innocent Suffering**: Is harming civilians justified to achieve political goals?
- **Effective Pressure**: Do sanctions actually change behavior or just cause suffering?
- **International Stability**: What precedent do sanctions set for future conflicts?

**Stakeholder Analysis**:
- **Sanctioning Nations**: Claim moral duty to combat cult influence
- **Target Population**: Civilians face starvation and medical crises
- **Regional Government**: Caught between foreign pressure and domestic control
- **International Traders**: Economic relationships disrupted
- **Humanitarian Organizations**: Struggle to provide aid within sanctions

### **The Automation Dilemma**
Magical constructs can perform dangerous work safely but would eliminate jobs for desperate workers. Do efficiency and safety justify unemployment during crisis?

### **The Inheritance Question**
When shadow-touched individuals "die" but their consciousness continues in altered form, who inherits their property? Original family or transformed entity?

### **The Resource Monopoly Problem**
One family controls the only source of anti-corruption crystals. Do they have right to charge premium prices during crisis or obligation to provide affordable access?

### **The Refugee Integration Challenge**
Refugees from corrupted regions need support but providing aid strains resources for existing residents. How much sacrifice can be asked of communities?

### **The Future Investment Paradox**
Should scarce resources fund immediate relief or long-term reconstruction? Present suffering versus future prosperity creates impossible choices.

## DM Notes

Economic dilemmas work best when connected to characters' personal experiences and relationships. Build toward major resource allocation crises by first showing smaller economic tensions. Allow players time to debate and discuss options - economic choices often have no time pressure and benefit from thorough consideration. Remember that most people have limited understanding of economic theory, so focus on practical consequences rather than abstract principles.
