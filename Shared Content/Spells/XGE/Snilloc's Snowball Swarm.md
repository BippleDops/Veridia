# Snilloc's Snowball Swarm
A flurry of magic snowballs erupts from a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice: 3d6|avg` (3d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
