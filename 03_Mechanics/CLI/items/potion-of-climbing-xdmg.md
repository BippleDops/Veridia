# Potion of Climbing
*Potion, common*  


- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, you gain a [Climb Speed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/climb-speed-xphb.md) equal to your [Speed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) for 1 hour. During this time, you have [Advantage](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Strength ([Athletics](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Athletics)) checks to climb.

This potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.
