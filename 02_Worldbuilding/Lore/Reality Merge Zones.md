# Reality Merge Zones
*Where Two Worlds Become One, and Survival Demands Adaptation*

> *"In the Merge Zones, the very air might drown you and the water may refuse to wet your skin. Physics becomes negotiable, magic becomes unpredictable, and survival depends not just on what you know, but on how quickly you can adapt to rules that change with every step."*
> — [[Master Environmental Specialist Tidal Convergence]], Reality Merge Zone Survival Expert

## Player-Facing Summary

Reality Merge Zones is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Reality Merge Zones as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Reality Merge Zones.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Reality Merge Zones to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at Reality Merge Zones to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to Reality Merge Zones active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
