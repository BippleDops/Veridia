These ships integrate [[Complete Pressure Adaptation System]], [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]], [[Complete Reality Merger System]], [[Complete Faction Warfare System]], [[Memory Trading Economy System|Memory Trading Economy]], and [[Deep Mother]]. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Pressure-Adaptive Vessels (Examples)


**Summary**: ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Pressure-Adaptive Vessels (Examples) - Key information at a glance.

- Coral Leviathan (Living coral hull; grows new bulkheads at Crush+)
- Parasite Choir Ship (Neural symbiosis; crew shares senses; Sanity risk)
- Memory Ghost Sub (Phase-through on consumed route memories; identity bleed)
- Crystal Resonator (Pressure-immune hull; vulnerable to harmonic shatter)
- Deep Blessed Nave (Navigates by madness; automatic prophecy pings)
- Tide Serpent (Flex spine hull; tunnels through current walls)
- Lantern Warden (Bio-luminescent veil; stealth in shadow blooms)
- Abyss Harvester (Pressure dredges; economic module)
- Anchor Frigate (Dual anchor mounts; escort duties)
- Echo Skiff (Scout; records memory echoes; fragile)
- Maelstrom Rider (Vortex engine; risky but fast)
- Shellback Cruiser (Segmented armor; localized repair)
- Wail Engine Boat (Sonic cannon; fear effects)
- Pearl Borer (Siege sub; bore torpedoes)
- Kelp Weave Cutter (Tangle immunity; boarding specialist)
- Rift Listener (Detects merger pre-shocks)
- Pressure Choir Barge (Crew chant reduces environmental DCs)
- Shadow Lantern Sloop (Shadow-sight optics; sanity saves on use)
- Leviathan Tamer (Harpoon arrays; creature control)
- Sovereign of Silt (Flagship; mobile base) GM Note: Use [[New_Ship_Template|New Ship Template]] to add more. Aim for 50+ designs by expanding each class. ### Random Aquatic Complication (d10)

1 Pressure surge â€¢ 2 Kelp snare â€¢ 3 Cavitation bloom â€¢ 4 Shadow bloom â€¢ 5 Merger flicker â€¢ 6 Leviathan passing â€¢ 7 Parasite cloud â€¢ 8 Memory storm â€¢ 9 Thermal vent â€¢ 10 Hull hymn (ship hums prophecy) See also: [[Vessel_Horror_Intensifier|Vessel Horror Intensifier]], [[Journey_Event_Compiler|Journey Event Compiler]], [[Transportation_Infrastructure]]. ## Player-Facing Summary Aquabyssos Submarines is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Aquabyssos Submarines as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Aquabyssos Submarines. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A merchant needs help stealing before the new moon
