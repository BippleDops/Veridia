*Explosive* - **Weight**: 1.0 lbs. As an action, you can either throw a grenade at a point up to 60 feet away or use a Grenade Launcher to propel the grenade to a point up to 1,000 feet away. The grenade explodes at that point, creating a particular effect in a 20-foot-radius [[Area of Effect Xphb]]. Each creature in the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (`5d6`) Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 73* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Fragmentation grenade xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
