# Talon's Skitmaster (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *illusion*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (10-foot radius sphere)

**Components**: V, S, M (a pound of sand)

**Duration**: 3 hours


## Effects
You draw a square of sand no greater than 20 feet by 20 feet, and tell a story. This spell creates illusions of the creatures and objects in the story, which move and act ac-cording to your narration. At the same time, you are covered in shadows—you do not disappear, but your body (although not your voice) seems to fades into the background.

The creatures are slightly translucent and are obviously illusions. They cannot move past the sandy line and are completely in-substantial and silent—you must produce the voices and sound effects. However, you can direct the illusions to appear to interact with living creatures and physical objects, if you wish.

If you stop narrating the story or per-forming actions (including singing or addi-tional spellcasting) that enhance the story, take a break longer than 15 minutes, or step beyond the boundary of the sandy line, the spend ends.

If you cast a spell such as *enthrall* while using this spell, the targets are at disadvantage on their saving throws.
