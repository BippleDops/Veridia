## Overview
The Sky Sailor Fighter embodies the aerial combat traditions of [[Aethermoor]], masters of three-dimensional warfare who fight from the decks of skyships and through the endless expanse of cloud-filled skies. These warriors have adapted traditional maritime combat techniques to the unique challenges of aerial warfare, becoming experts in wind-based tactics and high-altitude combat.

## Core Concept
Sky Sailors are specialized fighters who combine naval combat traditions with aerial expertise. They excel at fighting on moving platforms, using wind currents to their advantage, and coordinating with crew members during skyship battles. Many serve aboard the great airships of the [[Aethermoor]] fleet or as elite sky marines for boarding actions and aerial reconnaissance.

### Fighter Archetype: Storm Captain
At 3rd level, Sky Sailor Fighters gain access to the Storm Captain archetype:

## Favored Weapons
1. **Cutlass**: Traditional sky sailor weapon, perfect for close quarters
2. **Hand Crossbow**: Quick ranged option for aerial combat
3. **Harpoon**: For boarding actions and ship-to-ship combat
4. **Thunder Cannon**: Explosive ranged weapon for ship warfare

### Sky Fighting (New)
When fighting on a moving platform, in the air, or during unstable conditions, gain +2 to AC and advantage on Acrobatics checks to maintain balance.

## Cultural Background
Sky Sailors represent the proud maritime tradition of Aethermoor adapted to aerial warfare. They maintain many traditional naval customs while developing new techniques for three-dimensional combat. Honor, duty, and crew loyalty are central values, along with the freedom that comes from mastering the endless expanse of sky.

This build emphasizes the unique aspects of aerial naval combat while maintaining classic fighter versatility and battlefield control options.
