## Description
Live thieves are carted off or slain; dead thieves are left to the mortician or the ravens. By drinking two vials of this mild poison (one vial for demihumans or weak humans), a thief can all but stop his heart and breathing for 30 minutes. Most awake thereafter in simpler hands from which to escape, though some have come to buried in pine boxes.

## Additional Details
Actual duration is `dice: 1d20+10` rounds
