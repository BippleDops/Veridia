# Poison Spray
You extend your hand toward a creature you can see within range and project a puff of noxious gas from your palm. The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take `dice: 1d12|avg` (1d12) poison damage.

This spell's damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (`dice: 2d12|avg` (2d12)), 11th level (`dice: 3d12|avg` (3d12)), and 17th level (`dice: 4d12|avg` (4d12)).
