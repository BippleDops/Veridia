## Description
Though some riders let their mounts chafe under a load of [[Bags|bags]] tied sloppily together, others wisely use our saddlebags. These saddlebags are joined by a double-thick and double wide leather strap that spares the beast the pain of binding ropes. Each bag can hold as much as one [[Rucksack|rucksack]], spreading the weight in kind fashion across the animalâ€™s hindquarters. (2 gp)
