## Description
Although I cannot conceive why anyone would willingly partake of this dry, bland, flour-and-water, unseasoned biscuit, apparently there are those among my customers who became fond of them during their time at sea. For those who wish to relive those days of glory (and scurvy) I offer this dubious culinary delight. (I use the term loosely.) Stock up. It wonâ€™t quickly go bad. Hard-tack: 10 cp/dozen.
