# Torpor
*Adventuring gear, poison (ingested)*  


- **Properties**: [Poison](/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties.md#Poison)
- **Cost**: 600 gp

A creature subjected to Torpor poison must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [Poisoned](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition for `4d6` hours. The creature's [Speed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) is halved while the creature is [Poisoned](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way.
