The most powerful of the metallic dragons, these awe-inspiring dragons strive to protect that which is good and bend fate toward a brighter future. Their kind dispositions don't prevent gold dragons from engaging in combat when necessary, though, and they exhale brilliant flames and weakening magic to rout their foes. Gold dragons favor grasslands and pristine forests, frequently dwelling near awe-inspiring natural wonders or guarding [[monuments|monuments]] from ancient civilizations. In their lairs, gold dragons hoard coins and gems, but they frequently put their treasure to use in pursuit of greater goals. They often use their riches to buy rare lore books, pay informants, or patronize idealistic adventurers. ### Gold Dragon Lairs Gold dragons make their homes in places of natural and magical wonder.```statblock
