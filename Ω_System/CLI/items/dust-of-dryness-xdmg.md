# Dust of Dryness
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  



This small packet contains `1d6 + 4` pinches of dust. As a [Utilize](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Utilize) action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust over water, turning up to a 15-foot [Cube](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) of water into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible. A creature can take a [Utilize](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Utilize) action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so destroys the pellet and ends its magic.

As a [Utilize](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Utilize) action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust on an Elemental within 5 feet of yourself that is composed mostly of water (such as a [Water Elemental](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-elemental-xmm.md) or a [Water Weird](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird-xmm.md)). Such a creature exposed to a pinch of the dust makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking `10d6` Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
