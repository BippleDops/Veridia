## Description
Luthic is Gruumsh's wife and the paragon of maternity to all ores. She is the Cave Mother, a fierce dweller in the darkness who raises new broods of ores to be vicious and strong. Her symbol is the cave bear, and ore females raise such bears alongside ore whelps. Females particularly attracted to Luthic grow long nails and lacquer them, learning to use these claws as weapons much as Luthic uses her own.

Ore females devoted to Luthic are in charge of fortifying and maintaining an ore stronghold. They help to guarantee the survival of the tribe, and most are skilled in the healing arts. The most powerful among Luthic's disciples are the claws of Luthic, which can use the Cave Mother's magic to heal, protect, and curse.

As befits followers of a god who doesn't speak, hands of Yurtrus remove their tongues to emulate their deity, for a reason similar to why an eye of Gruumsh puts out one of its eyes.
