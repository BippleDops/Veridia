# Dragon's Breath
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a hot pepper)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch one willing creature, and choose Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Poison. Until the spell ends, the target can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to exhale a 15-foot [[cone-area-of-effect-xphb|Cone]]. Each creature in that area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `3d6` damage of the chosen type on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d6` for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes**: [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Fighter (Eldritch Knight)]]; [[list-spells-classes-sorcerer|Sorcerer]]; [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]; [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Rogue (Arcane Trickster)]]; [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Bard (College of Lore)]]; [[list-spells-classes-wizard|Wizard]]; [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-draconic-sorcery-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Sorcerer (Draconic Sorcery)]]
