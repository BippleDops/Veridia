# Scroll of Titan Summoning (Blob of Annihilation)
*Scroll, legendary*  



When you take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to read this scroll, a [[blob-of-annihilation-xmm|Blob of Annihilation]] appears in an unoccupied space on the ground or in water that you can see within 1 mile of yourself.

The [[blob-of-annihilation-xmm|Blob of Annihilation]] is [[hostile-attitude-xphb|Hostile]] toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]]. If the [[blob-of-annihilation-xmm|Blob of Annihilation]] is summoned into a space that isn't large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted.
