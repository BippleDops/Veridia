# Instrument of the Bards, Doss Lute
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/doss-lute.webp#right)


An Instrument of the Bards is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `2d4` Psychic damage.

You can play the Doss [Lute](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/lute-xphb.md) to cast one of the following spells: [Fly](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/fly-xphb.md), [Invisibility](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility-xphb.md), [Levitate](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/levitate-xphb.md), [Protection from Evil and Good](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good-xphb.md), [Animal Friendship](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/animal-friendship-xphb.md), [Protection from Energy](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/protection-from-energy-xphb.md) (Fire damage only), and [Protection from Poison](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/protection-from-poison-xphb.md). Once the Doss [Lute](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/lute-xphb.md) has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
