# Banishment
*4th-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pentacle)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

One creature that you can see within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be transported to a harmless demiplane for the duration. While there, the target has the [Incapacitated](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition. When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

If the target is an Aberration, a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend, the target doesn't return if the spell lasts for 1 minute. The target is instead transported to a random location on a plane (DM's choice) associated with its creature type.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.

**Classes**: [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Warlock](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Paladin](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md); [Wizard (Abjurer)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-abjurer-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Paladin (Oath of Vengeance)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-vengeance-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Ranger (Monster Slayer)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-monster-slayer-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Ranger (Horizon Walker)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-horizon-walker-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Cleric](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Wizard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
