*Explosive* - **Weight**: 1.0 lbs. An an action, you can light a Dynamite Stick and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away, where it explodes. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius [[Area of Effect Xphb centered on that point makes a **DC 12** Dexterity saving throw, taking``dice: 3d6``Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. It takes 1 minute to bind two or more Dynamite Sticks together so they explode at the same time. Each stick after the first increases the damage by`d6`(to a maximum of``dice: 10d6``) and the effect's radius by 5 feet (to a maximum of 20 feet). It takes 1 minute to rig dynamite with a longer fuse so it explodes after a longer period of time, such as 1 minute or 10 minutes. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 73* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Dynamite stick xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
