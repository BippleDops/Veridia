## Overview

This document profiles notable cultists of the Deep Mother, showcasing the various stages of transformation and indoctrination. Each profile demonstrates how ordinary individuals gradually evolve into something beyond human understanding, yet retain enough of their original personality to remain compelling NPCs rather than faceless monsters. These characters can serve as allies, enemies, tragic figures, or moral challenges depending on campaign needs.

**Personality**: Earnest and helpful, genuinely believes he's found answers to life's problems. Defensive when criticized but not aggressive. Still loves his family deeply and sees cult membership as improving his ability to provide for them.

**Role in Campaign**: 
- Perfect recruitment vector - his obvious improvement makes cult attractive

- Information source - attends outer circle meetings, overhears recruitment strategies
