The Pressure Cleric represents a unique divine tradition that venerates the crushing depths of [[Aquabyssos]] as a sacred force. These clerics serve deities of the deep ocean, channeling the inexorable power of water pressure to heal, harm, and maintain the cosmic balance between surface and depth. They are both healers who help communities adapt to crushing environments and warriors who wield pressure as a weapon. ## Core Concept

Pressure Clerics worship deities associated with ocean depths, water pressure, and the transformation that occurs under extreme conditions. They believe that pressure reveals truth by stripping away superficial illusions, that depths hold sacred mysteries, and that the crushing force of the ocean is a purifying divine power. Many serve as deep-sea chaplains, pressure adaptation specialists, or guardians of abyssal temples. ### Divine Domain: Pressure Domain

At 1st level, Pressure Clerics choose the Pressure Domain: #### Domain Spells

| Cleric Level | Spells |
|-------------|--------|
| 1st | *Create or Destroy Water*, *Detect Magic* |
| 3rd | *Hold Person*, *Enhance Ability* |
| 5th | *Water Breathing*, *Water Walk* |
| 7th | *Control Water*, *Freedom of Movement* |
| 9th | *Maelstrom*, *Greater Restoration* | #### Channel Divinity: Pressure Wave (2nd Level)

As an action, create a crushing wave of pressure in a 30-foot cone. All creatures in area make Constitution saving throw or take 2d8 + cleric level force damage and be knocked prone. Creatures that succeed take half damage and aren't knocked prone. Structures and objects take double damage. #### Channel Divinity: Depth Healing (2nd Level)

As an action, touch creature and restore hit points equal to 5 Ã— cleric level. If cast underwater or at significant depth, also removes one level of exhaustion and grants resistance to cold damage for 1 hour. #### Divine Strike (8th Level)

Once per turn, add 1d8 force damage to weapon attacks. At 14th level, increases to 2d8. ### Feature: Sacred Depths

You have access to temples, shrines, and holy sites throughout Aquabyssos, especially in deep-sea locations. Temple communities provide healing, information, and shelter. You can perform religious ceremonies and are recognized as legitimate clergy by most underwater communities. ### Cleric/Paladin (Devotion)

Combine divine magic with martial prowess. Perfect for crusading pressure warriors. ### Cleric/Druid (Land - Coast)

Nature magic complements divine depth abilities. Excellent for environmental specialists. ### Cleric/Fighter (Eldritch Knight)

Martial training enhanced by pressure magic. Ideal for temple guardians. ### Cleric/Warlock (Great Old One)

Deep entities provide additional power. Suitable for clerics who've touched cosmic mysteries. ## Theological Considerations

Pressure Clerics worship aspects of water, depth, and transformation. Common deities include:
- **Thalassos the Deep**: God of ocean trenches and crushing depths
- **Pelagia the Transformer**: Goddess of adaptation and pressure-induced change
- **Abyssos the Truthbringer**: Deity who reveals reality through crushing force ## Progression Notes

- Early levels focus on basic pressure adaptation and depth ministry

- High levels can manipulate massive pressure systems and guide community transformation
