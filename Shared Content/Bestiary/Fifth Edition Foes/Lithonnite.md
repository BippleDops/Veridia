## Special Traits
**Soft Underbelly:** A lithonnite's shell has AC 18. If it can be attacked from underneath, where its body is exposed, its AC is only 11. Its soft body has resistance to bludgeoning damage from nonmagical weapons.

**Stony Camouflage:** While sitting motionless in water, a lithonnite is impossible to distinguish visually from a mosscovered boulder.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A lithonnite attacks twice with tentacles.

**Tentacles:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (`dice: 1d10+3`) slashing damage. If both attacks hit the same target, it takes an additional 7 (`dice: 2d6`) bludgeoning damage and is grappled and restrained. While the lithonnite has a target grappled, it can attack only that target.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate and warm aquatic, underground

**Organization**: Solitary or pair
