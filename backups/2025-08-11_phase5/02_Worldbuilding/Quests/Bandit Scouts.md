# Bandit Scouts

**Type:** Wilderness Adventure/Combat/Escort  
**Level:** 2-6  
**Location:** [[The Kelp Highways]], [[Frontier Settlements]], [[The Abyss Reaches]]  
**Duration:** 2-4 sessions  
**Threat:** Organized bandit scouts are planning coordinated raids on merchant caravans and frontier settlements

## Overview
Reports have been flooding into [[Abyssos Prime]] of increased bandit activity in the outer reaches of [[Aquabyssos]]. These aren't desperate criminals or opportunistic raiders—they're organized, well-equipped scouts conducting reconnaissance for what appears to be a major criminal operation. The party is hired to investigate these sightings, protect a crucial supply caravan, and uncover the larger threat before it can strike at the heart of [[Aquabyssos]] commerce.

## Background
The [[Kelp Highway Security Forces]] have been stretched thin as trade has expanded throughout [[Aquabyssos]]. This has created opportunities for criminal organizations to establish bases in remote areas. What makes this situation particularly dangerous is that the bandits appear to be using military tactics and equipment, suggesting either deserters from the [[Depth Wardens]] or backing from a larger criminal syndicate.

Recent incidents include:
- Merchant caravans reporting shadowy figures following them for days
