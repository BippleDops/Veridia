# Color (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *1st-level*

**School**: *illusion*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: Special

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
You may permanently change the color of cloth, leather, or any other inanimate object. The time it takes to color the item varies on the complexity of the color: changing the en-tire item to a single color takes 1 action, but patterns or variations of color require you to trace the design you wish on the item with your finger while picturing the colors you desire, a process that may take several minutes.
