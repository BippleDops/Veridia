# Adamantine Weapons
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 78* 

Adamantine is an ultrahard metal found in meteorites and extraordinary mineral veins. In addition to being used to craft [[adamantine-armor-xdmg|adamantine armor]], the metal is also used for weapons.

Melee weapons and ammunition made of or coated with adamantine are unusually effective when used to break objects. Whenever an [[adamantine-weapon-xdmg|adamantine weapon]] or piece of [[adamantine-ammunition-xge|ammunition]] hits an object, the hit is a critical hit.

The adamantine version of a melee weapon or of ten pieces of ammunition costs 500 gp more than the normal version, whether the weapon or ammunition is made of the metal or coated with it.
