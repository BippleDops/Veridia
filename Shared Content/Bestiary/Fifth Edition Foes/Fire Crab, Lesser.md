*A massive crab with a square-shaped, reddish-brown carapace covered with dark red and yellow markings scuttles forward, pincers raised. Tiny flames lick its body, erupting at irregular intervals from its underbelly. Its eyes are perched atop two long eyestalks that protrude from the center of the carapace.*

## Special Traits
**Burning Grip:** The body of a lesser fire crab generates intense heat. Any creature that starts its turn with one or more lesser fire crabs latched onto it takes 2 fire damage for each of those lesser fire crabs. Once a lesser fire crab has latched onto a character, it moves with that character when the character moves, as if the character was moving a grappled character (half-speed). A lesser fire crab releases its grip when killed or when the character wins a Strength contest against it. Up to four lesser fire crabs can latch onto a Small character, and up to eight can latch onto a Medium character.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A lesser fire crab makes two pincer attacks. Both must be against the same target.

**Pincer:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (`dice: 1d4+2`) slashing damage plus 2 (`dice: 1d4`) fire damage and the lesser fire crab latches onto the target with its burning grip (see above).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Elemental Plane of Fire

**Organization**: Solitary, cluster (4–7), or colony (11–20)

## Description
Fire crabs are invertebrates found roaming the fiery shores of the Elemental Plane of Fire, where they enjoy crawling and swimming through pools and lakes of liquid flame. They spend their time eating the superheated rocks and plants of their home plane. Their lairs take the form of large burrows under the fiery seas or along the shore, near their “water source.” Such burrows are sometimes very large, housing up to 20 of these creatures. On the rare occasions when fire crabs are found on the Material Plane, they spend their time in or near active volcanoes and hot springs.

The most notable feature of fire crabs, besides the flames playing across their bodies, are their large pincers. Males can be distinguished from females because one of the male’s claws is noticeably larger than the other. Fire crabs have six spindly, segmented legs, blackish-red in color.

Fire crabs are generally not aggressive creatures, but they can be highly territorial, especially if they feel that their lair is threatened. In that case, they attack without hesitation and fight to the death. Both greater and lesser fire crabs tend to focus all their effort against one enemy until it is dead, then shift to the next, and so on.
