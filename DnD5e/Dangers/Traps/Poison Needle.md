# Poison Needle
## Overview
*Mechanical trap*
A poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest's lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.

When the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.

A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap's presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle.

A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.

## Variant Poison Needle Trap (XGE)
*Simple trap (level 1â€“4, deadly threat)*
A tiny, poisoned needle hidden in a lock is a good way to discourage thieves from plundering a hoard. Such a trap is usually put in a chest or in the door to a treasure chamber.
### Trigger.
Anyone attempting to pick or open the lock triggers the trap.
### Effect.
The triggering creature must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 10 minutes. While poisoned in this way, the creature is paralyzed. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned.
### Countermeasures.
A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the needle, but only if a character inspects the lock. A successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disables the needle, and a check with a total of 10 or lower triggers the trap.
