# The Seven Shards Campaign
*An Epic Cross-Realm Adventure*

## Campaign Overview

The Seven Shards Campaign is an epic adventure that spans both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor, dealing with ancient artifacts of immense power that threaten to either unite or destroy both realms. These crystalline shards, fragments of an primordial entity known as the Deep Mother, have been scattered across both worlds after a cataclysmic event in the distant past.

### The Core Mystery

Long ago, the Deep Mother - an entity of pure consciousness and power - was shattered into seven fragments to prevent her from consuming all reality. Each shard retained a portion of her power and malevolent intelligence. Now, as the barriers between worlds weaken, the shards are awakening and calling to each other, threatening to reform the Deep Mother unless the heroes can find and either destroy or properly contain them.

## Campaign Themes

- **Unity vs Division**: The shards represent the choice between bringing worlds together or tearing them apart
- **Ancient Power**: Dealing with forces beyond mortal comprehension
- **Sacrifice**: What price is worth paying to save both worlds?
- **Identity**: Who are you when faced with reality-altering power?
- **Time**: Racing against cosmic forces while dealing with personal growth
