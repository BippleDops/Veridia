# The Neutral Current Tavern
*Where All Currents Meet and Stories Flow*

> *"In the deep waters, there are few comforts greater than a warm meal, good drink, and the company of fellow travelers. Here, diplomats and merchants, spies and scholars all share the same tables, and somehow, peace prevails."*
