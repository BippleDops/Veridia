## Special Traits
**Create Spawn:** Any humanoid slain by a darnoc reanimates as a darnoc in `dice: 1d4` rounds. Spawned darnoc are under the command of the darnoc that created them and remain enslaved until its death, when they become independent. They do not retain any of the abilities they had in life.

**Ghost Form:** As an action, a darnoc can become incorporeal for up to 10 minutes each day. While incorporeal, the darnoc has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons, it gains tactical advantage on attack rolls, its slam attack does an extra `dice: 1d6` necrotic damage, and it can move through creatures and solid objects as though they were difficult terrain. The darnoc takes 5 (`dice: 1d10`) force damage if it is still inside another solid object or creature at the end of its turn.

**Symbol of Discord (1/Day):** Once per day as an action, a darnoc can scribe a symbol of discord in the air. All creatures with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher within 60 feet who see the symbol must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or immediately fall into loud bickering and arguing with those around him or her. Meaningful communication is impossible while bickering. If creatures of different alignments are affected and bickering, each has a 30% chance that they feel compelled to attack the person they are bickering with who is the most different in alignment. Bickering lasts `dice: 5d4` rounds. Fighting (if it occurs) begins `dice: 1d4` rounds into the bickering and lasts `dice: 2d4` rounds. Once drawn, the darnoc's symbol lasts two hours, making it useful as a temporary trap or delaying tactic.

## Actions
**Slam:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d8+2`) bludgeoning damage, and the creature's maximum number of hit points is reduced by the same amount. Hit points lost to this attack can't be healed by any means until the darnoc's curse is broken with a greater restoration spell or comparable magic.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any

**Organization**: Solitary or gang (2â€“4)

## Description
The darnoc is a corrupting evil presence whose very touch sucks the life from an opponent bit by painful bit. Darnocs are said to be the restless spirits of oppressive, cruel, and power-hungry individuals cursed forever to an existence of monotony and toil, forbidden by the gods to taste the spoils of the afterlife they so desperately craved in life. Darnocs often walk the same halls and repeat the same actions of their insipid existence over and over again while dressed in the clothes they wore in life. Because of their great greed, many darnocs are found in treasury vaults endlessly counting coins. Another common haunt is a graveyard, where the darnoc endlessly gloats at the headstones of the business foes it bested in life. When distracted from its reverie of remembered life, the creature flies into an inconsolable rage, which usually leads to it lashing out without provocation at the first individual who approaches it or tries to communicate with it.
