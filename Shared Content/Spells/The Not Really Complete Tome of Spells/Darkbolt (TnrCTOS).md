# Darkbolt (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a dead worm or a piece of octopus or squid tentacle)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You create a whip made out of a black, rubbery tentacle. This whip has a reach of 30 feet and attacks with your spell attack modifier. If it misses, it quickly slithers back to you and can be used again the following round.

On a hit, the whip inflicts 3d8 bludgeon-ing damage and wraps around the target, grappling it (escape DC is equal to your spell save DC). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and you cannot use the *darkbolt* on another target. In addition, at the start of each of the targetâ€™s turns, the *darkbolt* squeezes, causing an additional 3d8 bludgeoning damage.
