# Saving Throw
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 373. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A saving throwâ€”also called a saveâ€”represents an attempt to avoid or resist a threat. You normally make a saving throw only when a rule requires you to do so, but you can decide to fail the save without rolling. The result of a save is detailed in the effect that allowed it. If a target is forced to make a save and lacks the ability score used by it, the target automatically fails.
