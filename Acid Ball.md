### Description
Caster creates and shoots a 6" diameter ball of deadly acid from the palm of his hand. Upon hitting its target or traveling its full range it explodes into a 10' radius. The ball of acid will expand from its center point filling the radius as completely as  possible, but it will not expand more than 10' from its center point. The caster’s skill bonus for this spell is also his OB for it as well. Without scaling, the Acid Ball spell is capped to a maximum Tiny External Poison attack in terms of size.

If the attack is directed at a person or creature, that person is the center point of the attack and receives a special +20 to the critical roll if one results. All others receive a critical without this modifier. Only one critical roll is made for all within the  sphere.

### Scaling Options
Increase Elemental Attack Potency *(per each attack size increase)* +2 PP

Increase Range *(per +50')* +1 PP

Increase Radius *(per extra 10' radius)* +2 PP
