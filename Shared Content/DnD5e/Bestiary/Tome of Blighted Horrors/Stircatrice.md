# Stircatrice
## Overview
### Stircatrice
![[xjg3oxfo.nm0.png|Stircatrice|300]]
[[xjg3oxfo.nm0.png|open outside]]

*The creature flaps its batlike wings awkwardly through a series of bounding leaps, its red-rimmed eyes fixated in rage on its target. Beneath these eyes in its insectoid head, a long beaklike proboscis extends forward seemingly testing the air, with a pitch-black wattle dangling below. The body of the creature is lean like that of a cockerel with feathers as black as its wattle and six insectlike legs with jagged, grasping claws. A long, serpentine tail extends behind the creature, also feathered in the same inky plumes.*

## Special Traits
**Blood Drain and Calcification:** A grappled creature takes `dice: 1d6 + 2` necrotic damage from blood loss at the start of the stircatrice’s turn. It must also make a successful DC 11 Con saving throw or be restrained by rapid calcification of its tissue. A restrained creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself with a success. If a restrained creature fails a second Con saving throw at the start of a grappling stircatrice’s turn, the creature is petrified instead. A petrified creature makes another DC 11 Con saving throw every 24 hours, and returns to normal on a success.

**Leaping Lunge:** If a stircatrice moves at least 60 feet straight toward a target by dashing, it can make a tail attack against that target as a bonus action. It gets tactical advantage on the tail attack and, if the tail hits, on the followup wing hook attack.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A stircatrice stabs with its tail once. If the tail hits, the creature attacks the same target with its wing hooks as a bonus action.

**Melee Attack—Tail:** +4 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d4 + 2` piercing damage, and the stircatrice attacks the same creature with its wing hooks as a bonus action.

**Melee Attack—Wing Hooks:** +4 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: the target is grappled (escape DC 8).

## Description
**Environment**: Plains, urban (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]])

**Organization**: Pair, flight (3–5), or flock (6–12)

These aberrant creatures are prone to sudden rages and are nearly mindless in their aggression. They routinely attack creatures larger than themselves to feed on their blood. They are clumsy flyers at best, preferring to move in great leaping hops that appear gangly and uncoordinated but actually cover distance very quickly. Kept in menageries throughout the city, stircatrices are usually kept in double-walled cages since even a peck of their long, slender beak can spread a fatal infection.

Some yogis and entertainers of a more dramatic nature enter a stircatrice’s cage to meditate or prove their mastery over the fearsome creature. An equal number of these have ended up as bloodless corpses as have emerged alive — to the raucous approval of their audience.
