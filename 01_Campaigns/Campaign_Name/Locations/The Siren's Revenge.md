## General Info
**Location**: [[01_Campaigns/Campaign_Name/Locations/The Contested Waters.md]]

## Description
The Siren's Revenge is a fast and heavily armed smuggling vessel that is the flagship of the Shadowhaven Smugglers Ring. It is captained by the notorious [[01_Campaigns/Campaign_Name/NPCs/Scar "The Navigator" Kellian.md]].

## GM Notes
- The ship is a formidable opponent, and it is a match for any vessel in the Shadowhaven Navy.
- The ship is often used to transport illegal goods and to raid the ships of the Port Sorrow Trading Company.
- The ship is a good place to find rare and exotic goods, but it is also a very dangerous place.
