# Crystal Bloom
*Living Crystal Growth Transformation*

## Overview
Crystal Bloom begins when magical crystals take root in living flesh, slowly converting organic matter into living gemstone. The transformation grants increasing durability and magical resonance at the cost of flexibility and humanity.

### Drawbacks
- **Brittleness**: Vulnerability to thunder damage
- **Weight**: +10 lbs to body weight
- **Stiffness**: -5 ft. movement in cold environments

### Roleplay Hooks
- Fascination with gems and crystals

- Dreams of vast crystal caverns

## Stage II: Manifestation (11-20 TP)
*Crystal patches spread across body*

- **Magical Dependence**: Require magical energy daily or gain exhaustion
- **Temperature Extreme**: Paralyzed if temperature drops below freezing
- **Monstrous Appearance**: Cannot hide transformation, feared by most

### Roleplay Hooks

*"Beauty eternal, humanity forgotten. The crystal song calls, and flesh answers."*

## Player-Facing Summary

Crystal Bloom is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Crystal Bloom as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Crystal Bloom.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
