## General Info
**Location**: Shadowhaven

## Description
The Merchants Guild is a powerful and influential guild that controls all of the legitimate trade in and out of Shadowhaven. They are a force to be reckoned with, and they are not afraid to use their wealth and influence to protect their interests.

## Player-Facing Summary

Merchants Guild is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Merchants Guild as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Merchants Guild.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
