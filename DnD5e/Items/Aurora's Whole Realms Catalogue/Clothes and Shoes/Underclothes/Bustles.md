## Description
These unique [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Items|items]] have become extremely fashionable among the ladies of the Sembian nobility. I stock bustles chiefly for the opera-going ladies of Sembia, but expect them to spread throughout Toril as more women wish to present a fuller figure to their admirers. 

Bustles attach around the waist and extend the curves of the hips in a complementary fashion beneath the dress. They enhance the allure of countless Sembian women, and can do the same for you! 

Our bustles are composed of the finest woven steel wire, conforming to feminine contours while not bending except under the most extraordinary stress. We add padding to each of our bustles to eliminate chafing. Small or large side bustle: 5 gp; small or large rear bustle: 9 gp.
