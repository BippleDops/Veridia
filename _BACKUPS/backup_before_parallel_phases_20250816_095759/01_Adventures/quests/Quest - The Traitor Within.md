The leak threatens ongoing war efforts and soldier morale. ## Investigation Methods

**Interrogation:** Question suspects without revealing investigation

**Communication Patterns:** Regular contact with unknown parties
**Behavioral Changes:** Stress, guilt, or unusual actions
**Access Logs:** Who had information before each failed operation

**Motivation:** Protecting family members held hostage by enemy forces
**Methods:** Providing intelligence through coded supply requisitions
**Complications:** Not malicious traitor but desperate father ## Major Encounters
