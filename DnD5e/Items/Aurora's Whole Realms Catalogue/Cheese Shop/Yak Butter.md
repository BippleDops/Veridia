## Description
Actually a soft cream cheese made from yak milk, yak butter is found from the Spine of the World to the Hordelands. Yak butter is mild and delicate, but has more character than most cream cheeses, and is excellent with blackbread or elven loaves. I promise to deliver the freshest available yak butter to our customers, but the best always comes in the spring, after the first major thaw. Available in 1 lb earthenware containers (4 sp) or 100 lb wooden tubs (35 gp). Weight of container is not counted in final weight.
