# Favor of the Ocean Winds (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of driftwood)

**Duration**: 1 year


## Effects
This spell is granted by gods of the sea and of travel. You cast this on an amulet, which must be given to a willing creature. If that creature is ever cast overboard and lost at sea while wearing the amulet, it will be guaranteed to be washed ashore somewhere habitable with plenty of available fresh water and food (although not necessarily safe or close to civilization).
