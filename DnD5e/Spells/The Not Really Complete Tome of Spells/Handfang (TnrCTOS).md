# Handfang (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *cantrip*

**School**: *Transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
You cause a sharp-toothed maw to appear on the palm of your hand. The maw is completely under your control and can be easily hidden by curling your fingers over it, wearing a glove, keeping the palm flat against your body, etc.

If you touch someone with that hand (this requires an attack if done in combat), it bites, doing 1d4 + your Strength ability modifier in piercing damage and 1d4 acid damage from its corrosive saliva.

The acid damage increases when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th-level (4d4), and 17th level (8d4)
