## Description
When this 4-foot-tall [[Mirror|mirror]] is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The [[Mirror|mirror]] weighs 50 pounds, and it has [[2 - Armor|AC]] 11, 10 hit points, and [[17 - Damage and Healing|vulnerability]] to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.

If the [[Mirror|mirror]] is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.

Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated [[Mirror|mirror]] while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15 [[Charisma|Charisma]] saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with [[2 - Advantage and Disadvantage|advantage]] if the creature knows the mirror’s nature, and [[14 - Monsters|constructs]] succeed on the saving throw automatically.

An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the [[Mirror|mirror]]’s cells don’t age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.

If the [[Mirror|mirror]] [[8 - Traps|traps]] a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.

While within 5 feet of the [[Mirror|mirror]], you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.

In a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the [[Mirror|mirror]]. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.
