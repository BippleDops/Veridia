## Overview
A disgraced former Crystal Warden turned mercenary, Marcus gained his moniker after developing the ability to shatter crystal formations—including those growing from infected people. His methods are brutal but effective, making him simultaneously sought after and reviled.

## Appearance

- Right eye replaced with a shard of amber crystal (can see crystal corruption)
- Wears modified Crystal Warden armor with pieces torn off
- Carries a greataxe with crystal fragments embedded in the blade
- Left hand shows early stages of crystal corruption he constantly suppresses

## Personality
- Grimly pragmatic about the crystal plague
- Believes mercy killing infected people is a kindness
- Bitter about his exile from the Crystal Wardens
- Maintains a rough code of honor despite his reputation
- Self-medicates with alcohol and alchemical suppressants

## Relationships
- **[[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/NPCs/Lord Commander Gareth Steelborn]]**: Former mentor; complicated relationship of respect and disappointment
- **[[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/NPCs/Captain Lyanna Brightshield]]**: Occasionally feeds her information about crystal-related crimes
- **[[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/NPCs/Vex Shadowthorn]]**: Regular employer for dirty work the Syndicate needs done
- **[[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/NPCs/High Inquisitor Maltheos]]**: Sees Marcus as useful but ultimately expendable
- **[[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/NPCs/Master Artificer Korvin Gearwright]]**: Supplies his suppressants in exchange for field data
- **Sister Morwyn Veilkeeper**: Warned him about his eventual fate if corruption continues

## Current Activities
- Hunting a crystal-infected cult in [[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/Locations/Port Meridian]]'s quarantine zone
- Investigating reports of "living crystals" that move with purpose
- Secretly documenting stages of crystal infection for personal research
- Building a network of other infected individuals who refuse to give in
- Tracking someone called "The Crystal Prophet" who claims infection is evolution

## Secrets
> [!warning] DM Only
> - Killed his own infected squad during his last mission as a Crystal Warden
> - The crystal in his eye is slowly spreading into his brain
> - Has discovered a way to temporarily reverse crystal corruption but requires fresh Shard fragments
> - Maintains a hidden safehouse with detailed maps of crystal growth patterns
> - Is being mentally influenced by the crystal in his eye—sometimes receives visions from the Amber Shard
> - Has made a pact: if he ever fully turns, he's arranged for specific people to kill him

## Combat Tactics

- Uses environment to his advantage, especially crystal formations
- Willing to sacrifice himself to destroy crystal threats
- Carries specialized ammunition for different corruption types

## Plot Hooks
1. Hires party to help clear a crystal nest in exchange for corruption suppression techniques
2. Needs help tracking down a former Crystal Warden who's fully turned
3. Information about a black market dealing in corruption "cures"
4. Requests assistance investigating disappearances in the quarantine zone

## Quotes
- "The crystal doesn't care about your politics or your gods. It just grows."
- "I've shattered men I called brothers. What's one more monster?"
- "Every dawn I check the mirror. The day I don't recognize myself, I'm done."
- "There's no cure, only delay. Make your time count."

## DM Notes
Marcus represents the personal cost of the crystal corruption and serves as a morally grey ally. He's useful for introducing party members to the darker aspects of the crystal plague while providing a potential tragic figure who might need saving—or stopping—depending on how his corruption progresses. His connections span multiple factions, making him an excellent information broker and quest giver for mid-level threats.
