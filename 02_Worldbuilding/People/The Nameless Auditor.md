## Overview
The Nameless Auditor serves as the "Scale of Information" on the [[Silverscale Consortium]]'s Board of Scales, controlling the organization's vast intelligence network and information-gathering operations. Their true identity, appearance, and even gender remain unknownâ€”they appear differently to each person who meets them, and their name changes with each interaction. What remains constant is their supernatural ability to acquire, process, and weaponize information.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **The Information Hunt**: Seek specific knowledge from their archives
2. **The Double Agent**: Discover spy within party's organization
3. **The Blackmail Plot**: Help or oppose their leverage operations
4. **The Identity Crisis**: Investigate their true nature and origins
5. **The Information War**: Navigate conflict between rival intelligence networks

### Special Abilities
**Identity Flux.** The Auditor's appearance and voice change each round. Creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to maintain a clear memory of the encounter.

**Memory Drain.** When the Auditor touches a willing or unconscious creature, they can extract specific memories. The target must make a DC 20 Constitution save or lose those memories permanently while the Auditor gains access to them.

**Information Network.** The Auditor can use an action to consult their network of spies, functioning as a *legend lore* spell with no casting time or material components (3/day).

**Shapechanger.** The Auditor can use their action to polymorph into any humanoid form they've encountered, retaining their game statistics.

**Spellcasting.** The Auditor is an 18th-level spellcaster. Spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 20, +12 to hit). Known spells:
- Cantrips (at will): *mage hand*, *minor illusion*, *prestidigitation*, *detect magic*
- 1st level (4 slots): *charm person*, *detect thoughts*, *disguise self*

- 9th level (1 slot): *foresight*

### Actions
**Multiattack.** The Auditor makes two attacks or casts a spell and makes one attack.

**Memory Blade.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) psychic damage. Target must succeed on DC 20 Wisdom save or have their most recent memory stolen.

**Revelation Strike (Recharge 5-6).** The Auditor whispers a devastating secret about the target. One creature within 60 feet must succeed on DC 20 Wisdom save or take 35 (10d6) psychic damage and be stunned until end of their next turn.

**Blackmail Command (1/Day).** The Auditor uses compromising information to control a target within 60 feet. Functions as *geas* spell (save DC 20) but lasts only 24 hours.

### Lair Actions (The Black Ledger Archive)
On initiative 20 (losing ties), the Auditor can take one lair action:
- **Memory Storm**: All creatures in 30-foot radius make DC 18 Wisdom save or be confused for 1 round
- **Identity Crisis**: One creature must make DC 18 Charisma save or forget their name and background for 1 minute
- **Surveillance Activation**: Hidden eyes throughout lair allow Auditor to see and target anyone within 120 feet
- **Information Overload**: Release overwhelming data stream, all creatures in 60 feet take 10 (3d6) psychic damage

### Regional Effects
The area within 1 mile of the Auditor's primary archive has the following effects:
- Written messages sometimes change their content after being read
- People have difficulty remembering conversations and meetings
- Mirrors occasionally show reflections of other people instead of the viewer
- Secrets feel heavier and more burdensome to keep
- Information seems to spread faster than should be possible

### The Watching World
Under the Auditor's influence, [[Aethermoor]] has become a place where privacy no longer exists:

**Omnipresent Observation:** Every conversation monitored, communications intercepted, transactions tracked, travel documented
**The Chilling Effect:** Self-censorship, relationship difficulties, suppressed innovation, eroded social trust
**The Control Mechanism:** Behavior modification through fear, enforced conformity, managed competition, controlled social mobility

### The Dehumanization Process
**Loss of Individual Identity:** People become data points, worth measured by information value, privacy treated as selfishness
**The Mechanical Perspective:** Emotions viewed as weaknesses, relationships analyzed as networks, suffering evaluated for information value

### Theory 1: The Collective Consciousness
A collective entity composed of hundreds of absorbed personalities, having lost their original identity to accumulation of others.

### Theory 2: The Living Archive
A magical construct created by Consortium founders, designed specifically as the ultimate information gathering tool.

### Theory 3: The Divine Punishment
A former deity of knowledge punished for abuse of power, stripped of divine nature but retaining abilities.

### Theory 4: The Time Traveler
A being from the future attempting to prevent disasters by gathering information about current events.
