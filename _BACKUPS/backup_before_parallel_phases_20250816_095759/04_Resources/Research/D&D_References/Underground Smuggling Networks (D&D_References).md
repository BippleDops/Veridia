- The smuggler's activities have helped reunite families but may have contributed to plague spread
- Government enforcement would separate children from their infected parents
- Community opinion is deeply divided about whether the smuggler is hero or criminal
- Resolution requires balancing individual compassion with public safety concerns ### The Network Infiltration
