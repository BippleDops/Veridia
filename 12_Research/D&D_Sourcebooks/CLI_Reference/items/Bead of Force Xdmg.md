*Wondrous item, rare* - **Weight**: 0.5 lbs. This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically,`1d4 + 4`Beads of Force are found together. You can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes in a 10-foot-radius [[Area of Effect Xphb]] on impact and is destroyed. Each creature in the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take`5d4`Force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save or are partially within the area are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can pass through. An enclosed creature can take a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action to push against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's [[Fly Speed Xphb]]. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 234.
