# Intensify Nature (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (1 mile radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (a small curved horn carved with runes, worth 100 gp)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour


## Effects
You multiply the power of one currently existing natural phenomena or condition. For instance, a light rain becomes a downpour, while a heavy rain becomes a torrential downpour that causes flooding. Gentle snow becomes a blizzard and even cause white outs. Heat waves and cold snaps become incredibly intense and damaging. Breezes become hurricanes and stiff winds become tornadoes. Light fog completely obscures the area.
