# Wolfjaws (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a wolf’s tool)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You transform your hand into a pair of powerful, wolf-like jaws. You use your spell attack modifier to attack. On a hit, you inflict 2d8 + your Strength modifier in piercing damage and, if you choose, the target is grappled (escape DC equals your spell save DC). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and you can’t bite another target. At the beginning of each of your turns, you inflict an additional 1d8 piercing damage for as long as the grapple remains in effect.
