# Temple of the First Tide
*Where the Primordial Waters First Stirred with Divine Purpose*

> *"Before there was civilization, before there were cities or kingdoms, before there were even names for the depths and the heights—there was the First Tide. In this sacred place, the primordial waters first learned to dance with purpose, to flow with intention, to carry life instead of merely carrying weight. Here, where the boundary between the material ocean and the Elemental Plane of Water grows thin as seafoam, we remember what it means to be one with the eternal flow."*
> — [[High Tide Keeper Nautilus Primordial]], Guardian of the First Tide
