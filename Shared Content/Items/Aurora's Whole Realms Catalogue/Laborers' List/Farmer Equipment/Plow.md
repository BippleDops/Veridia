## Description
Sages say the plow is the unsung hero of our flourishing culture, letting the work of one farmer feed up to three families. We no longer offer iron plows because of repeated complaints of their tendency toward breakage. Our small plow (8 gp) can be pulled even by a mule or a very strong man, whereas our large plow (15 gp) requires a plow horse or an ox. Both work well with our [[Harness|harness]] or yoke, turning even stiff and [[Clay|clay]]-strewn fields.
