## Overview
Mayor Bartholomew Thompson is a portly, gregarious man who exemplifies the corruption that festers in Aquabyssos's outer districts. Once a successful surface merchant who fled to the depths to escape gambling debts, Thompson has rebuilt his fortune through a combination of legitimate trade and criminal enterprise. His jovial exterior masks a calculating mind that treats politics as just another business transaction.

## Physical Description
Standing 5'8" with a rotund belly that strains against expensive silk vests, Thompson has the appearance of a man who enjoys life's finer pleasures. His salt-and-pepper beard is meticulously groomed, and his thinning hair is always slicked back with expensive oils. His most distinctive feature is his collection of gaudy gold teeth, installed to replace ones lost in various "business negotiations."

Thompson's clothing is a deliberate display of wealthâ€”fine silks in deep blues and greens, gold-threaded embroidery, and more jewelry than is strictly tasteful. He carries himself with the swagger of a successful merchant, always ready with a hearty laugh and a firm handshake.

## Personality
- **Public Face**: Boisterous, generous, always ready with a joke or a drink
- **Private Reality**: Calculating, ruthless, treats people as assets or liabilities
- **Values**: Profit above all, loyalty (when properly purchased), efficient corruption
- **Fears**: Exposure of his criminal empire, return to poverty, assassination by rivals
- **Quirks**: Constantly adjusts his gold tooth with his tongue when nervous

## Background
Bartholomew Thompson arrived in Aquabyssos fifteen years ago as a desperate man fleeing surface debts. He quickly realized that the underwater city's complex bureaucracy and distant imperial oversight created perfect opportunities for creative business practices. Starting with a small import business, he gradually expanded into smuggling, bribery, and eventually politics.

His rise to mayor wasn't through popular vote but through strategic bribes, blackmail, and the mysterious disappearance of his primary rival. He's transformed Drift Harbor from a struggling working-class district into a thriving (if morally questionable) commercial hub.

## Special Abilities

**Political Immunity.** Thompson has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or intimidated by creatures of lower social standing. Government officials must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma save to take hostile action against him without evidence of wrongdoing.

**Merchant's Eye.** Thompson can assess the value of any object or service with perfect accuracy. He automatically knows if someone is lying about prices, quality, or availability.

**Criminal Network.** Thompson can call upon his network of smugglers, thieves, and corrupt officials. This functions as a *sending* spell to any criminal contact within 500 miles, usable 3 times per day.

**Escape Plan.** Thompson always has an exit strategy. Once per day, he can cast *misty step* as a bonus action, representing his use of hidden passages and prepared escape routes.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** Thompson makes two attacks with his Silverfish Stiletto or uses a cantrip and makes one weapon attack.

**Silverfish Stiletto.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage. The target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution save or be poisoned for 1 minute.

**Corrupt Influence (3/Day).** Thompson offers a bribe or threatens consequences. One creature within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom save or be charmed for 1 hour, during which they are inclined to help Thompson with reasonable requests.

**Call for Backup (1/Day).** Thompson summons 1d4 Thugs (his bodyguards/enforcers) who arrive in 1d4 rounds. These thugs are equipped with nets and clubs, specializing in subduing rather than killing.

## Equipment
- **Silverfish Stiletto** (+1 dagger coated with paralytic fish toxin)
- **Studded Leather Armor +1** (reinforced with coral plates)
- **Ring of Protection** (gold band set with pearls)
- **Boots of Swimming** (allow underwater movement without penalty)
- **Mayor's Seal of Office** (grants legal authority and some magical protections)
- **Bag of Holding** (concealed in his vest, contains emergency funds and escape supplies)
- **Potion of Greater Healing** (2)

## Current Activities
- Negotiating a major smuggling contract with surface pirates
- Planning to eliminate evidence of his role in the previous mayor's disappearance

**Public Face**: 
- Thriving commercial district with bustling markets
- New civic improvements and public works projects
- Regular cultural festivals that boost tourism
- Efficient government services (for those who can pay)

**Hidden Reality**:
- Widespread corruption in all levels of government
- Organized crime operating with official protection  
- Slavery and human trafficking disguised as "employment services"
- Environmental destruction ignored in favor of profitable ventures

## Plot Threads
Thompson serves as an excellent example of corruption at the local level and can be involved in numerous plot threads:
- Political corruption exposÃ© campaigns
- Crime family wars and territory disputes
- Moral dilemmas about working with corrupt but effective leaders
- Investigations into government crime and conspiracy
- Stories about redemption versus justice
- Economic warfare between legitimate and criminal enterprises

His character represents the theme that evil often wears a friendly face and that corruption can make even beneficial changes morally questionable. He's simultaneously an effective leader who's improved his district and a criminal who's destroyed lives for profit.
