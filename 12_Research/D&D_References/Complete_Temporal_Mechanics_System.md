## Time Travel Procedures
1) Define Intent (when/where; personal scope or world scope)
2) Pay Cost (memories, sanity loss, anchor fuel)
3) Roll Timeline Check: 1d100 vs. Integrity with modifiers from [[Complete Reality Merger System]]
4) Resolve Paradox Risk; apply loop or branch per Resolution Rules

## Temporal Anomalies (d20 samples)
1 Lost hour â€¢ 2 Reverse rain â€¢ 3 Two dawns â€¢ 4 Child elder â€¢ 5 Future scar â€¢ 6 Yesterday news â€¢ 7 Late shadow â€¢ 8 Faded door â€¢ 9 Unborn echo â€¢ 10 Rust to sap â€¢ 11 Spoken tomorrow â€¢ 12 Clock melt â€¢ 13 Ancient smell â€¢ 14 Backward tide â€¢ 15 Premature ruin â€¢ 16 Posthumous visitor â€¢ 17 Looping bell â€¢ 18 Twin path â€¢ 19 Midnight at noon â€¢ 20 Leap month

## Time-Dilated Zones
- Fast/Slow/Stopped bands; pressure/altitude modifiers interact with time flow
- Long exposure: Aging/regression risks; sanity checks

Integration: [[Complete Reality Merger System]], [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]], [[Memory Trading Economy System|Memory Economy]], [[Deep Mother]].

## Player-Facing Summary

Complete Temporal Mechanics System is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Complete Temporal Mechanics System as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Complete Temporal Mechanics System.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
