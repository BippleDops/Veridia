# Scroll of Protection (Fiends)
*Scroll, rare*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/scroll-of-protection.webp#right)


Using a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to read the scroll creates a 5-foot [Emanation](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) originating from you. For 5 minutes, {{item.detail2}} can't enter or affect anything in the area. However, if you move in such a way that an Fiend would be inside the area, the effect ends.

As a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action, a creature within 5 feet of the [Emanation](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) can attempt to overcome it, which forces the creature to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the creature ceases to be affected by the [Emanation](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md).
