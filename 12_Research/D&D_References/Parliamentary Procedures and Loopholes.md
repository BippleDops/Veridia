## Overview

The Parliament of Echoes operates under a complex system of ancient procedures, emergency protocols, and deliberate ambiguities that enable political manipulation. These systems, designed for surface democracy, have been warped by underwater existence and the Shadow Conspiracy's influence.

#### Daily Operations
1. **Dawn Current** (Opening): Ceremonial drowning of previous day's failures
2. **Morning Flow** (Committee Work): Closed-door negotiations
3. **Midday Depth** (Main Session): Public debates and voting
4. **Evening Ebb** (Shadow Time): Off-record discussions
5. **Night Tide** (Recess): Informal dealing and conspiracy

### The Depth Clause
Any member may invoke "Depth Privilege" and force a vote to deeper pressure levels, where fewer members can participate. This has been used to:
- Pass unpopular legislation with small coalitions
- Exclude surface-sympathizer senators
- Create artificial emergencies requiring uimous consent

### The Echo Amendment Process
Due to temporal anomalies, amendments can be "pre-ratified" by arguing they were already approved in an alternate timeline. Requires:
- Three senators claiming memory of the vote
- Temporal documentation (often forged)
- Shadow witness testimony

### The Forgotten Quorum
If more than half the senate forgets a session occurred, it legally never happened. The Shadow Conspiracy exploits this by:
- Using memory-wiping techniques on opposition senators
- Scheduling votes during temporal flux periods
- Employing selective amnesia spells

### The Proxy Parliament
Shadow replacements can vote on behalf of their originals, but only if:
- The original is "temporarily indisposed"
- The shadow proves it shares the original's interests
- No one formally objects within three tidal cycles

### The Drowning Powers Act
In times of crisis, any three senators can invoke emergency powers that:
- Suspend normal voting procedures
- Allow legislation by executive decree
- Bypass committee reviews
- Enable martial law declarations

#### Historical Invocations
1. **The Great Forgetting (2847):** Mass memory loss epidemic
2. **Surface Contact Crisis (2851):** First surface world communication
3. **The Shadow Separation (2852):** Independent shadow citizenship
4. **Current Crisis (2855):** Ongoing succession dispute

### The Last Resort Protocol
If fewer than twelve senators remain capable of voting, the parliament can:
- Appoint temporary replacement senators
- Merge with the executive branch
- Dissolve itself in favor of imperial rule
- Transfer power to the Deep Mothers

#### The Infinite Review Loop
Committees can refer bills to each other indefinitely, creating legal limbo. Used to:
- Kill legislation without formal rejection
- Create time for public opinion manipulation
- Generate bureaucratic exhaustion in opposition

#### The Retroactive Committee Assignment
Using time distortion, committees can claim jurisdiction over bills after they've already passed, then:
- Revoke legislation through "pre-review"
- Claim procedural violations occurred
- Demand re-votes under different conditions

#### The Memory Bank
Central repository of "donated" memories used for:
- Compromising material on political opponents
- Blackmail evidence against corrupt officials
- Historical revision through selective memory sharing

#### Shadow Surveillance Network
Shadow replacements in key positions provide:
- Real-time intelligence on private conversations
- Advance warning of political moves
- Intimate personal details for leverage

### The False Quorum
Using shadow replacements to create the appearance of sufficient attendance while:
- Ensuring only loyal voters participate
- Hiding the true absence of opposition members
- Maintaining constitutional legitimacy

### Memory Revision Politics
Key votes can be "remembered differently" through:
- Collective memory editing sessions
- Historical document alteration
- Witness testimony modification

### Pressure Politics
Using depth requirements to:
- Exclude surface-adapted senators from crucial votes
- Force physical dependency on government-provided pressure suits
- Create artificial scarcity of voting-capable members

### Temporal Gerrymandering
Manipulating time distortion to:
- Extend voting periods for favorable outcomes
- Compress opposition preparation time
- Create paradoxes that invalidate inconvenient decisions

#### The Shadow Majority Project
Systematic replacement of opposition senators with shadow duplicates who vote according to conspiracy directives while maintaining perfect cover.

#### The Forgotten Legislation Initiative
Using selective amnesia to make senators forget they voted against certain bills, allowing for retroactive passage claims.

#### The Depth Pressure Campaign
Gradually moving all important votes to crushing depths, effectively disenfranchising anyone not fully adapted or lacking advanced pressure gear.

#### The Temporal Lock Maneuver
Creating legislative decisions that exist in quantum superposition, allowing them to be both passed and failed simultaneously until observation collapses the state favorably.

#### The Memory Guard Protocol
Some senators maintain backup memories in secure locations to prevent manipulation.

#### Shadow Authentication Systems
Developing methods to distinguish between original senators and shadow replacements.

#### Pressure Equity Movements
Advocating for voting technology that works at all depths, preventing depth-based discrimination.

#### Temporal Stabilization Committees
Working to eliminate time distortion effects from parliamentary procedures.

#### The Transparency Current
Proposed legislation requiring all votes to occur in memory-recording zones where manipulation is impossible.

#### The Anti-Forgetting Amendment
Constitutional change that would prevent memory modification from affecting legal proceedings.

#### The Depth Democracy Act
Guaranteeing equal voting rights regardless of pressure adaptation level.

### Investigation Scenarios
1. **The Missing Vote:** Records show a bill passed, but half the senators deny voting for it
2. **Shadow Double Exposure:** A senator appears to vote on both sides of an issue simultaneously
3. **The Temporal Filibuster:** A speech that somehow prevented its own delivery
4. **Memory Audit:** Discovering systematic memory theft from committee members

### Political Intrigue
1. **The Forgotten Amendment:** A constitutional change no one remembers debating
2. **Pressure Play:** Opposition senators mysteriously lose pressure adaptation
3. **The Echo Chamber:** Votes being influenced by decisions not yet made
4. **Committee of Lies:** An entire committee that officially doesn't exist but keeps passing legislation

### Reform Campaigns
1. **Transparency Movement:** Installing unbreakable recording systems
2. **Shadow Rights Advocacy:** Ensuring shadow replacements have legal standing
3. **Memory Protection Initiative:** Preventing unauthorized memory modification
4. **Democratic Depth:** Making voting accessible regardless of pressure adaptation

### Emergency Powers Activation
| Crisis Level | Senators Required | Powers Granted | Time Limit |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|------------|
| Minor | 3 | Committee Bypass | 1 Tide Cycle |
| Major | 5 | Executive Authority | 1 Week |
| Catastrophic | 7 | Martial Law | 1 Month |
| Existential | 9 | Imperial Emergency | Indefinite |

### Voting Pressure Requirements
| Depth | Pressure (PSI) | Special Equipment | Voting Weight |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 0-50 feet | 2-22 | Surface Suits | 1x |
| 50-200 feet | 22-87 | Standard Gear | 1.5x |
| 200-500 feet | 87-217 | Deep Suits | 2x |
| 500+ feet | 217+ | Specialized Gear | 3x |

### Memory Manipulation Detection
| Method | Reliability | Cost | Time Required |
|--------|-------------|------|---------------|
| Crystal Resoce | 95% | High | 1 Hour |
| Shadow Testimony | 70% | Medium | 1 Day |
| Temporal Echo | 85% | Very High | 1 Week |
| Psychic Probe | 90% | Medium | 30 Minutes |
