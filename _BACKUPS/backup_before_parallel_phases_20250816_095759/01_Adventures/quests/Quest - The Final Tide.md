Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Quest The Final Tide as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Quest The Final Tide. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Plot Hooks - Someone is protecting a witness for money

- A shipment has gone missing and truth emerges
