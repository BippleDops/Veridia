## Description

02 Worldbuilding/Military/Combat Healers provides a structured approach to handling specific game situations that benefit from additional mechanical depth. This system integrates with existing D&D 5e rules while adding meaningful choices and consequences.

## Core Mechanics

### Basic Resolution
The fundamental process works as follows:

- **Roll Type**: d20 + modifiers vs. DC
- **Difficulty Range**: DC 10-25 based on challenge
- **Modifiers**: Ability scores, proficiency, circumstances

#### Resource Management
- **Points/Uses**: Limited resource to track
- **Recovery**: How resources regenerate
- **Costs**: What actions consume resources

#### Time Factor
