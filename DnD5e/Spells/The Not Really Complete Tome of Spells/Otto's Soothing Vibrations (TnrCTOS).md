# Otto's Soothing Vibrations (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
You point to a spot within range and begin humming. All aberrations, beasts, dragons, monstrosities, oozes, and plants with an Intelligence of 1 to 4 that are in a 20-foot-radius of that spot must make a Wisdom saving throw. Creatures that are actively being hostile, either to you or to something else, have advantage on that roll.

Creatures who fail hear the soothing hum and become calm. They stop what they doing in order to hear the sound and will show no fear or aggression unless you or your companions attack them first. In addition, those creatures will be at disadvantage on saving throws to resist being charmed.
