# Staff of the Adder
*Staff, weapon, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/staff-of-the-adder.webp#right)

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[item-properties#Versatile|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

As a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]], you can turn the head of this staff into that of an animate, venomous snake for 1 minute or revert the staff to its inanimate form.

When you take the [[actions#Attack|Attack]] action, you can make one of the attack rolls using the animated snake head, which has a reach of 5 feet. Apply your [[proficiency-xphb|Proficiency Bonus]] and Wisdom modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes `d6` Piercing damage and `3d6` Poison damage.

The snake head can be attacked while it is animate. It has AC 15, HP 20, and [[immunity-xphb|Immunity]] to Poison and Psychic damage. If the head drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]], the staff is destroyed. As long as it's not destroyed, the staff regains all lost [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] when it reverts to its inanimate form.
