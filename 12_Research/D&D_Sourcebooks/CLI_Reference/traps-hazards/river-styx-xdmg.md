# River Styx
*Generic Hazard*  

The "River Styx" courses through the Lower Planes. Tasting or touching its waters can shatter a creature's intellect and personality, as well as strip away its memories. Certain Fiends are immune to the river's effects.

Unless immune to the river's effects, a creature that drinks from the Styx, enters the river, or starts its turn in the river makes a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 19 (`3d12`) Psychic damage and can't cast spells or take the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action for 30 days. An affected creature can drink from the Styx and swim in its waters without suffering any additional effects.

The effect can be ended only by the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration-xphb|Greater Restoration]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/heal-xphb|Heal]], or [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish-xphb|Wish]] spell. If the effect isn't ended after 30 days, the effect becomes permanent and the creature loses all its memories. At that point, nothing short of a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish-xphb|Wish]] spell or divine intervention can undo the effect.

Water taken from the River Styx loses its potency after 24 hours, becoming a harmless, foul-tasting liquid. Arcanaloths, night hags, and other fell creatures might know rituals that can prolong the water's potency, at your discretion.
