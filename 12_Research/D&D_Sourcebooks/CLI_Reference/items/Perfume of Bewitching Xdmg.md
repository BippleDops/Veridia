# Perfume of Bewitching
*Wondrous item, common*  

This tiny vial contains magic perfume, enough for one use. You can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to apply the perfume to yourself, and its effect lasts 1 hour. For the duration, you have [[advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on all Charisma ([[skills#Deception|Deception]] and [[skills#Persuasion|Persuasion]]) checks made to influence a creature within 5 feet of yourself.
