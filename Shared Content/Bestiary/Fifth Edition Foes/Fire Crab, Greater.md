*A massive crab with a square-shaped, reddish-brown carapace covered with dark red and yellow markings scuttles forward, pincers raised.

## Special Traits
**Ring of Fire:** The body of a greater fire crab generates intense heat. Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of a greater fire crab takes 4 (`dice: 1d8`) fire damage. This damage is cumulative if more than one fire crab is within 5 feet of the character.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A greater fire crab attacks twice, in any combination of pincer and crush attacks.

**Pincer:** *Melee Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (`dice: 1d8+4`) slashing damage plus 2 (`dice: 1d4`) fire damage and the target is grappled.

**Crush:** *Melee Attack:* automatic hit, one creature already grappled at the start of the fire crab's turn. Hit: 8 (`dice: 1d8+4`) slashing damage plus 5 (`dice: 1d10`) fire damage and the target is grappled.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Elemental Plane of Fire

**Organization**: Solitary, cluster (2–5), or colony (6–11)

## Description
Fire crabs are invertebrates found roaming the fiery shores of the Elemental Plane of Fire, where they enjoy crawling and swimming through pools and lakes of liquid flame. They spend their time eating the superheated rocks and plants of their home plane. Their lairs take the form of large burrows under the fiery seas or along the shore, near their “water source.” Such burrows are sometimes very large, housing up to 20 of these creatures. On the rare occasions when fire crabs are found on the Material Plane, they spend their time in or near active volcanoes and hot springs.

The most notable feature of fire crabs, besides the flames playing across their bodies, are their large pincers. Males can be distinguished from females because one of the male’s claws is noticeably larger than the other. Fire crabs have six spindly, segmented legs, blackish-red in color.

Fire crabs are generally not aggressive creatures, but they can be highly territorial, especially if they feel that their lair is threatened. In that case, they attack without hesitation and fight to the death. Both greater and [[Fire Crab, Lesser|lesser fire crabs]] tend to focus all their effort against one enemy until it is dead, then shift to the next, and so on.
