### Circle of the Sea (Level 3)

*Become One with Tides and Storms*

Druids of the Circle of the Sea draw on the tempestuous forces of oceans and storms. Some view themselves as embodiments of nature's wrath, seeking vengeance against those who despoil nature. Others seek mystical unity with nature by attuning themselves to the ebb and flow of the tides, following the rush of currents and waves and listening to the inscrutable whispers and roars of the winds.

### Circle of the Sea Spells (Level 3)

When you reach a Druid level specified in the Circle of the Sea Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

**Circle of the Sea Spells**

| Druid Level | Prepared Spells |
|-------------|-----------------|
| 3rd | [[fog-cloud-xphb (spells)]], [[Gust of Wind Xphb]], [[ray-of-frost-xphb (spells)]], [[Shatter Xphb]], [[Thunderwave Xphb]] |

| 7th | [[Control Water Xphb]], [[ice-storm-xphb (spells)]] |

### Wrath of the Sea (Level 3)

As a [[Action Xphb]], you can expend a use of your Wild Shape to manifest a 5-foot [[Area of Effect Xphb]] that takes the form of ocean spray that surrounds you for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), manifest it again, or have the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] condition.

When you manifest the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] and as a [[Action Xphb]] on your subsequent turns, you can choose another creature you can see in the [[Area of Effect Xphb]]. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take Cold damage and, if the creature is Large or smaller, be pushed up to 15 feet away from you. To determine this damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one die).

### Aquatic Affinity (Level 6)

The size of the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] created by your Wrath of the Sea increases to 10 feet.

In addition, you gain a [[swim-speed-xphb (variant-rules)]] equal to your [[Fly Speed Xphb]].

### Stormborn (Level 10)

Your Wrath of the Sea confers two more benefits while active, as detailed below.

#### Flight

You gain a [[Fly Speed Xphb]] equal to your [[Fly Speed Xphb]].

#### Resistance

You have [[boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats)]] to Cold, Lightning, and Thunder damage.

### Oceanic Gift (Level 14)

Instead of manifesting the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] of Wrath of the Sea around yourself, you can manifest it around one willing creature within 60 feet of yourself. That creature gains all the benefits of the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] and uses your spell save DC and Wisdom modifier for it.

In addition, you can manifest the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] around both the other creature and yourself if you expend two uses of your Wild Shape instead of one when manifesting it.
