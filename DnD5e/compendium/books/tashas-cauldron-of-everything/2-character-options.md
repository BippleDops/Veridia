# Character Options
*Source: Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, p. 7* 

When you make your D&D character, you have an array of options in the "Player's Handbook" to create the sort of adventurer you want. This chapter adds to those options, making it possible to realize even more character concepts. If you combine these options with those in "Xanathar's Guide to Everything", the possibilities for your characters become vast.

Here are the options featured in this chapter:

- A way to customize your character's origin by changing some of your racial traits
- Guidance on changing your subclass
- "The artificer class", a master of magical invention
- Class features and subclasses for every class in the "Player's Handbook"
- "Feats" for anyone who uses that optional rule

## Customizing Your Origin

See the Customizing Your Origin entry.

## Changing a Skill

Sometimes you pick a skill proficiency that ends up not being very useful in the campaign or that no longer fits your character's story. In those cases, talk to your DM about replacing that skill proficiency with another skill proficiency offered by your class at 1st level. A convenient time for such a change is when you reach a level that grants you the Ability Score Increase feature, representing that your character has spent a level or two studying the new skill and letting the old one atrophy.

## Changing Your Subclass

Each character class involves the choice of a subclass at 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. A subclass represents an area of specialization and offers different class features as you level up. With your DM's approval, you can change your subclass when you would normally gain a new subclass feature. If you decide to make this change, choose another subclass that belongs to your class and replace all your old subclass features with the features of the new subclass that are for your new level and lower.

### Training Time

To change your subclass, your DM might require you to spend time devoted to the transition, as you study the ways of the new specialization. This transition requires a number of days equal to twice your new level in the class; a higher level represents more to learn.

The DM might also require an expenditure of money to pay for training, magical reagents, or other goods needed for the transition. The cost is typically 100 gp times your new level. This cost might be accompanied by a quest of some sort. For example, a sorcerer who wants to adopt a Draconic Bloodline could be required to receive blood, a blessing, or both from an ancient dragon.

If you return to a subclass that you previously held, you forgo the gold cost, and the time required for the transition is halved.

### Sudden Change

Sometimes a character undergoes a dramatic transformation in their beliefs and abilities. When a character experiences a profound self-realization or faces an entity or a place of overwhelming power, beauty, or terror, the DM might allow an immediate subclass change. Here are a few examples:

- An Oath of Devotion paladin failed to stop a demonic horde from ravaging her homeland. After spending a night in sorrowful prayer, she rises the next morning with the features of the Oath of Vengeance, ready to hunt down the horde.
- A wizard lies down for a nap beneath an oak tree whose roots reach into the Feywild. In his dreams, he faces visions of multiple possible futures. When he awakens, his subclass features have been replaced by those of the School of Divination.
- A cleric of the War Domain has spent years in conflict with the enemies of her temple. But one day, she wanders into a sun-dappled glade, where her god once shed a tear of mercy over the world's suffering. Drinking from the glade's brook, the cleric is filled with such compassion for all people that she now bears the powers of the Life Domain, ready to heal rather than make war.

## Artificer

Masters of invention, [artificers](/compendium/classes/artificer-tce.md) use ingenuity and magic to unlock extraordinary capabilities in objects. They see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and then harnessed in their spells and inventions. You can find everything you need to play one of these inventors in the next few sections.

Artificers use a variety of tools to channel their arcane power. To cast a spell, an artificer might use alchemist's supplies to create a potent elixir, calligrapher's supplies to inscribe a sigil of power, or tinker's tools to craft a temporary charm. The magic of artificers is tied to their tools and their talents, and few other characters can produce the right tool for a job as well as an artificer.

### Artificers in Many Worlds

Throughout the D&D multiverse, artificers create inventions and magic items of peace and war. Many lives have been brightened or saved because of the work of kind artificers, but countless lives have also been lost because of the mass destruction unleashed by certain artificers' creations.

In the Forgotten Realms, the island of Lantan is home to many artificers, and in the world of Dragonlance, tinker gnomes are often members of this class. The strange technologies in the Barrier Peaks of the world of Greyhawk have inspired some folk to walk the path of the artificer, and in Mystara, various nations employ artificers to keep airships and other wondrous devices operational.

Artificers in the City of Sigil share discoveries from throughout the multiverse, and from there, the gnome artificer Vi runs a cosmos-spanning business that hires adventurers to fix problems that others deem unfixable. In Vi's home world, Eberron, magic is harnessed as a form of science and deployed throughout society, largely as a result of the wondrous ingenuity of artificers.

Below are recommendations for how you might build a Battle Master to reflect various types of warriors.

Each of these builds contains suggested fighting styles, maneuvers, and feats. Those suggestions are from the "Player's Handbook", except for the ones followed by an asterisk, which indicates an option introduced in this book.

### Archer

- **Fighting Style.** Archery
- **Maneuvers.** Disarming Attack, Distracting Strike, Precision Attack
- **Feats.** [Piercer](/compendium/feats/piercer-tce.md), [Sharpshooter](/compendium/feats/sharpshooter.md)

You prefer to deal with your enemies from afar, trusting in a well-placed arrow, javelin, or sling bullet to end a fight without a response. You rely on accuracy and probably subscribe to the axiom that "those who live by the sword die by the bow."

### Bodyguard

- **Fighting Style.** Interception,* Protection
- **Maneuvers.** Bait and Switch,* Disarming Attack, Goading Attack, Grappling Strike*
- **Feats.** [Alert](/compendium/feats/alert.md), [Observant](/compendium/feats/observant.md), [Sentinel](/compendium/feats/sentinel.md), [Tough](/compendium/feats/tough.md)

Love, money, or some other obligation motivates you to place your own body between harm and the one you're sworn to protect. You have honed the ability to sniff out potential threats and see your charge through dangerous situations.

### Brawler

- **Fighting Style.** Blind Fighting,* Two-Weapon Fighting, Unarmed Fighting*
- **Maneuvers.** Ambush,* Disarming Attack, Feinting Attack, Pushing Attack, Trip Attack
- **Feats.** [Athlete](/compendium/feats/athlete.md), [Durable](/compendium/feats/durable.md), [Grappler](/compendium/feats/grappler.md), [Resilient](/compendium/feats/resilient.md), [Shield Master](/compendium/feats/shield-master.md), [Tavern Brawler](/compendium/feats/tavern-brawler.md), [Tough](/compendium/feats/tough.md)

When bottles start breaking and chairs start flying, you're in your element. You love a good scrap, and you've likely seen your share of them. You may or may not have formal training, and while others might call you a dirty fighter, you're still alive.

### Duelist

- **Fighting Style.** Dueling, Two-Weapon Fighting
- **Maneuvers.** Evasive Footwork, Feinting Attack, Lunging Attack, Parry, Precision Attack, Riposte
- **Feats.** [Defensive Duelist](/compendium/feats/defensive-duelist.md), [Dual Wielder](/compendium/feats/dual-wielder.md), [Martial Adept](/compendium/feats/martial-adept.md), [Observant](/compendium/feats/observant.md), [Savage Attacker](/compendium/feats/savage-attacker.md)

You regard the duel as a proud tradition, a test of skill and wits that brings honor to those who can defeat an enemy while respecting the art. Your search for improvement is a consuming passion, and you draw on the expertise of the masters who've come before you as you work to perfect your form.

### Gladiator

- **Fighting Style.** Defense, Two-Weapon Fighting
- **Maneuvers.** Goading Attack, Menacing Attack, Sweeping Attack, Trip Attack
- **Feats.** [Athlete](/compendium/feats/athlete.md), [Charger](/compendium/feats/charger.md), [Dual Wielder](/compendium/feats/dual-wielder.md), [Durable](/compendium/feats/durable.md), [Grappler](/compendium/feats/grappler.md), [Martial Adept](/compendium/feats/martial-adept.md), [Savage Attacker](/compendium/feats/savage-attacker.md), [Tough](/compendium/feats/tough.md)

You've fought to entertain crowds, whether for sport or as punishment. Along the way, you learned to use all manner of weapons to battle all kinds of adversaries. You're practical yet theatrical, and you know how to employ fear as an effective tool in a fight.

### Hoplite

- **Fighting Style.** Defense, Thrown Weapon Fighting*
- **Maneuvers.** Brace,* Lunging Attack, Parry, Precision Attack
- **Feats.** [Athlete](/compendium/feats/athlete.md), [Grappler](/compendium/feats/grappler.md), [Piercer](/compendium/feats/piercer-tce.md), [Polearm Master](/compendium/feats/polearm-master.md), [Sentinel](/compendium/feats/sentinel.md), [Shield Master](/compendium/feats/shield-master.md)

With spear and shield, you follow in the footsteps of the heroes of ages past. You rely on discipline and athleticism to overcome improbable odds. Whether fighting in ranks alongside your comrades or squaring off as a lone warrior, you're equal to the task.

### Lancer

- **Fighting Style.** Dueling
- **Maneuvers.** Lunging Attack, Menacing Attack, Precision Attack, Pushing Attack
- **Feats.** [Heavy Armor Master](/compendium/feats/heavy-armor-master.md), [Mounted Combatant](/compendium/feats/mounted-combatant.md), [Savage Attacker](/compendium/feats/savage-attacker.md)

When the cavalry is called in, that means you. You ride out to greet your enemy with the point of your weapon. As you charge, the ground trembles, and only the heaviest blows can deter you.

### Outrider

- **Fighting Style.** Archery
- **Maneuvers.** Ambush,* Distracting Strike, Goading Attack, Precision Attack, Quick Toss*
- **Feats.** [Alert](/compendium/feats/alert.md), [Crossbow Expert](/compendium/feats/crossbow-expert.md), [Mounted Combatant](/compendium/feats/mounted-combatant.md), [Observant](/compendium/feats/observant.md), [Sharpshooter](/compendium/feats/sharpshooter.md)

You find freedom in the saddle and a companion in your mount. A headlong charge into combat is a blunt instrument for oafs. You prefer mobility and range, opting to find advantageous positions that allow you to deal with foes at full gallop while evading the most dangerous threats.

### Pugilist

- **Fighting Style.** Unarmed Fighting*
- **Maneuvers.** Disarming Attack, Evasive Footwork, Grappling Strike,* Menacing Attack, Pushing Attack, Riposte, Trip Attack
- **Feats.** [Athlete](/compendium/feats/athlete.md), [Durable](/compendium/feats/durable.md), [Grappler](/compendium/feats/grappler.md), [Savage Attacker](/compendium/feats/savage-attacker.md), [Tavern Brawler](/compendium/feats/tavern-brawler.md)

Where others rely on steel, you've got your fists. Whether through training or experience, you've developed a superior technique that can help you overcome an enemy in an up-close fight.

### Shock Trooper

- **Fighting Style.** Great Weapon Fighting
- **Maneuvers.** Menacing Attack, Pushing Attack, Sweeping Attack
- **Feats.** [Charger](/compendium/feats/charger.md), [Great Weapon Master](/compendium/feats/great-weapon-master.md), [Heavy Armor Master](/compendium/feats/heavy-armor-master.md)

Subtlety is not your style. You're trained to get straight into the fighting, busting through enemy lines and applying tremendous pressure quickly. Those who ignore you in combat do so at their peril.

### Skirmisher

- **Fighting Style.** Archery, Thrown Weapon Fighting*
- **Maneuvers.** Ambush,* Bait and Switch,* Distracting Strike, Quick Toss*
- **Feats.** [Alert](/compendium/feats/alert.md), [Dual Wielder](/compendium/feats/dual-wielder.md), [Mobile](/compendium/feats/mobile.md), [Skulker](/compendium/feats/skulker.md)

You thrive amid the chaos of battle. You use your mobility and versatility in combat to soften your adversaries and disrupt their formations. An enemy's plan rarely survives contact with you.

### Strategist

- **Fighting Style.** Defense
- **Maneuvers.** Commander's Strike, Commanding Presence,* Maneuvering Attack, Rally, Tactical Assessment*
- **Feats.** [Inspiring Leader](/compendium/feats/inspiring-leader.md), [Keen Mind](/compendium/feats/keen-mind.md), [Linguist](/compendium/feats/linguist.md)

To you, battles unfold like a game of chess. You understand that strength and speed are important in a fight, but it takes intellect and experience to know how best to apply them. That's where you come in.
