# Ambassador Korvin Blacktide

*"The surface and the depths need not be enemies. We merely seek... understanding."*

## Overview
Ambassador Korvin Blacktide serves as the enigmatic representative of [[Aquabyssos]], the submerged realm beneath Aethermoor's seas. Operating from a partially flooded embassy in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Shadowmere]], he maintains a veneer of diplomatic courtesy while pursuing darker agendas.

## Appearance
- Tall and unnaturally gaunt, with blue-grey skin that shimmers with barely visible scales
- Gills partially concealed by high collars
- Eyes that shift between human blue and abyssal black
- Wears waterlogged noble attire that never seems to dry
- Carries a staff topped with a piece of corrupted [[Aether Crystal]] fused with deep-sea pearls

## Personality
- Unnervingly polite and formal
- Speaks in maritime metaphors and references to "the depths"
- Shows genuine fascination with surface corruption patterns
- Barely concealed contempt for "air-breathers"

## Relationships
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]]**: Secret trading partner - smuggles Aquabyssos artifacts through the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Whisper Syndicate]]
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]**: Knows about her corruption, uses it as leverage
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/High Inquisitor Maltheos]]**: Mutual antagonism - Maltheos suspects Aquabyssos involvement in crystal corruption
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Captain Lyanna Brightshield]]**: Under investigation by her for suspicious shipwrecks near [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]]

## Current Activities
- Negotiating secret trade agreements for "depth-touched" crystals
- Recruiting surface dwellers for mysterious underwater expeditions
- Studying the interaction between Aether corruption and Aquabyssos's "Drowned Magic"
- Seeking information about the [[Seventh Shard]]

## DM Secrets
> [!warning] Hidden Truth
> Korvin is actually a Deep Herald - a transformed human who accepted the "Drowning Embrace" centuries ago. He's over 300 years old and remembers the surface world before it sank to create Aquabyssos. His true mission is to locate and corrupt one of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]] to create a permanent portal between realms.

> [!danger] The Black Tide Prophecy
> Korvin possesses fragments of an ancient prophecy suggesting that reuniting the Seven Shards while submerged in Aquabyssos's waters would transform all of Aethermoor into an underwater realm, "completing the Great Drowning" that began centuries ago.
