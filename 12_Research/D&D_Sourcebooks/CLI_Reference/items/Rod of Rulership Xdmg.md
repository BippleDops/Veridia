--- # Rod of Rulership

*Rod, rare (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/rod-of-rulership.webp#right) - **Weight**: 2.0 lbs. You can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] condition for 8 hours. While [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or your allies or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] in this way. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 301.
