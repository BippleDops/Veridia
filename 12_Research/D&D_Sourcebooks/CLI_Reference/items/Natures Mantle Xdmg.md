# Nature's Mantle
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a druid or ranger)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/natures-mantle.webp#right)

This cloak shifts color and texture to blend with the terrain surrounding you. While wearing the cloak, you can use it as a [[spellcasting-focus-xphb (variant-rules)]] for your Druid and Ranger spells.

While you are in an area that is [[lightly-obscured-xphb (variant-rules)]], you can [[actions#Hide|Hide]] as a [[Action Xphb]] even if you are being directly observed.
