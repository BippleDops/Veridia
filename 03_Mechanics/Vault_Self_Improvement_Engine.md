# Vault Self-Improvement Engine

Automatic cross-references, consistency validation, gap identification, integration tests, balance verification, emergent combinators.

## Cross-Reference Generator
- Periodically crawl and link related notes; surface orphaned content

## Consistency Validator
- Flag conflicting values (DCs, prices, names); suggest harmonization

## Gap Finder
- Detect missing examples, tables, or integrations per system

## Integration Tests
- Scenario checklists across systems (pressure+reality+sanity+memory)

## Balance Verification
- Heuristics to detect runaway combos; propose caps or costs

## Emergent Combinators
- Suggest new mechanics from existing interactions; log in backlog
