*2nd-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a straight piece of iron)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a Humanoid that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Paralyzed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Paralyzed) condition for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional Humanoid for each spell slot level above 2.
