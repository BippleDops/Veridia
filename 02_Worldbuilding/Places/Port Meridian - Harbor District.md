## Factions Present

- Pearl Guard customs officers squeeze revenue and information.
- The Coral Throne Syndicate arbitrages tariffs and rumor futures.
- Verdant Accord envoys quietly track bio-crafted goods and seed bans.

## For the Table (Quick Use)

- Negotiation DCs: Honest trade DC 12; Gray market DC 15; Smuggling DC 17. On a failure, progress with a telltale rumor seeded in the crowd instead of stalling.
- Hazards: Pressure surges (CON save DC 13 or gain 1 level of Fatigue), slipstream knocks (DEX save DC 12 or lose 1 item to the current).
- Rewards: Faction favor notes, tariff keys, market scrip worth 2d10×10 gp in local value.

## Threads to the Main Campaign

- Archivists claim a ledger fragment pointing toward [[The Lighthouse of Storms]].
- A clandestine auction circles artifacts tied to [[12_Research/D&D_Statblocks/The Whispering Expanse]].
- An information broker with ties to [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Elena Starweaver.md|Elena Starweaver]] trades memories for favors.

## Multiple Resolution Paths (Fail-Forward)

- Buy the schedule: Secure the Pressure Gate manifests; even on failure, you obtain a partial list that points to a decoy shipment and fresh leads.
- Bribe or distract: Create a diversion at Echo Quay; on a setback, the guard marks you but also warns of a coming tariff strike.
- Formal petition: Argue precedent at the Quiet Chapel; on a miss, the judge imposes a bond that grants limited passage and a clock to pay it back.
