--- # Wind Walk

*6th-level, Transmutation* - **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a candle)
- **Duration:** 8 hours You and up to ten willing creatures of your choice within range assume gaseous forms for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a target has a [[Fly Speed Xphb]] of 300 feet and can hover; it has [[immunity-xphb (variant-rules)]] to the [[conditions#prone|Prone]] condition; and it has [[boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats)]] to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. The only actions a target can take in this form are the [[actions#Dash|Dash]] action or a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to begin reverting to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which the target has the [[conditions#Stunned|Stunned]] condition. Until the spell ends, the target can revert to cloud form, which also requires a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action followed by a 1-minute transformation. If a target is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the target descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can't land after 1 minute, it falls the remaining distance. **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 341.
