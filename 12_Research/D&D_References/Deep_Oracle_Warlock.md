# Deep Oracle Warlock - Character Build

## Overview
The Deep Oracle represents those who have touched the consciousness of the [[Deep Mother]] and survived with their sanity intactâ€”or at least functional. These warlocks serve as prophets, investigators, and sometimes reluctant agents of an entity that exists beyond conventional reality. They possess unparalleled insight into cosmic truths at the cost of gradually losing their connection to mundane existence.

## Core Concept
Deep Oracles are warlocks whose patron is the [[Deep Mother]], an eldritch entity dwelling in the deepest trenches of reality itself. Unlike traditional Great Old One warlocks, Deep Oracles maintain a semi-voluntary relationship with their patron, trading visions of cosmic truth for the ability to perceive and prevent reality-threatening catastrophes. They often work to prevent the very apocalypse their patron might cause.

## Starting Statistics
- **Recommended Race**: Human (Aquabyssos), Deep One Hybrid, or Variant Human
- **Primary Ability**: Charisma
- **Secondary Abilities**: Wisdom, Intelligence
- **Starting Equipment**: Void-touched focus, prophetic journals, deep water breathing apparatus, tattered oracle robes, bone dice
