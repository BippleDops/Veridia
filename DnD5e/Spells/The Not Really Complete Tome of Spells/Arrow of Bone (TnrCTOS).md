# Arrow of Bone (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a powdered sliver of bone mixed with acid or the blood of an acidic creature, which is used to make the ink)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You paint runes of dire power on one missile or thrown weapon and it turns into chilling bone. You may then throw or fire the missile yourself or give it to a companion to use.

This missile does normal weapon damage, plus 10d10 necrotic damage, plus the target must make a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. Creatures that are immune to necrotic damage or poison are immune to this spell and only take normal damage from the missile.

If the sliver of bone you use comes from a close blood relative of the target (sibling, parent, or child), then the person who is firing or throwing the missile has advantage on the attack.
