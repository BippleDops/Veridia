# Shield of Far Sight
*Armor ([[shield-xphb|shield]]), rare*  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

A [[mind-flayer-xmm|mind flayer]] skilled at crafting magic items creates a shield of far sight by harvesting an eye from an intelligent humanoid and magically implanting it on the outer surface of a nonmagical shield. The shield becomes a magic item once the eyes is implanted, whereupon the [[mind-flayer-xmm|mind flayer]] can give the shield to a thrall or hang it on a wall in its lair. As long as the shield is on the same plane of existence as its creator, the [[mind-flayer-xmm|mind flayer]] can see through the shield's eye, which has [[senses#Darkvision|darkvision]] out to a range of 60 feet. While peering through this magical eye, the [[mind-flayer-xmm|mind flayer]] can use its Mind Blast action as though it were standing behind the shield.

If a shield of far sight is destroyed, the [[mind-flayer-xmm|mind flayer]] that created it is [[conditions#Blinded|blinded]] for `2d12` hours.
