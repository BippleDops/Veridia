# Captain Lyanna Brightshield

## Description
Captain Lyanna Brightshield cuts an imposing figure in her gleaming plate armor, the seal of Meridian prominently displayed on her breastplate. Standing just over six feet tall, she has the build of someone who trains daily and has seen real combat. Her short auburn hair is kept practical for wearing under a helmet, and her piercing green eyes miss nothing. A scar runs from her left eyebrow to her cheek - a memento from the Pirate Wars five years ago.

She moves with military precision and speaks with crisp authority, but those who know her well can see the weight of responsibility in her shoulders and the concern that creases her brow when she thinks no one is watching.

## Background
Lyanna rose through the ranks of the Meridian Guard through a combination of tactical brilliance, unwavering loyalty, and genuine care for the city's citizens. She was only twelve when a similar crystalline plague struck the outer villages, taking her parents. The young Queen Seraphina personally ensured Lyanna's education and training, creating a deep bond of loyalty that has evolved into something more complex over the years.

She earned her captaincy during the Pirate Wars, where her defensive strategies saved the harbor district from complete destruction. Now, at 31, she finds herself fighting an enemy that can't be defeated with sword and shield - and questioning whether the crown she serves is hiding terrible truths.

## Relationships
### Allies
- **[[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]**: Deep loyalty complicated by unspoken romantic feelings. Would die for her, but struggles with the Queen's recent secretive behavior.
- **[[Brother Marcus Steelbane]]**: Respects his dedication to healing. Often coordinates quarantine efforts with him.
- **Harbor Watch Guards**: Commands absolute loyalty from her 50-person unit.

### Rivals
- **[[High Inquisitor Maltheos]]**: Philosophical differences about magic and authority. Competing for influence over city's response to plague.
- **[[Vex Shadowthorn]]**: Sees them as a dangerous radical who endangers citizens.

### Complicated
- **[[Marina Red Tide Coralheart]]**: Knows Marina is a smuggler but recognizes her information network's value. An uneasy alliance of necessity.
- **[[Lord Aurelius Goldwave]]**: Political games frustrate her straightforward nature.

## Current Activities

## Secrets & GM Notes
### Hidden Motivations
1. **Love for the Queen**: Will become increasingly desperate as Queen's corruption progresses
2. **Parents' Death**: Suspects the previous plague was also artificially created
3. **Contingency Plans**: Has secretly prepared safe houses if government falls
4. **The Letter**: Carries an undelivered love letter to the Queen

### Plot Importance
- Key ally for reaching the Queen in later sessions
- Can provide military support if trust earned
- Her character arc parallels the corruption theme
- May sacrifice herself to save Queen in climax

### Corruption Interaction
- Highly resistant due to paladin training
- Advantage on saves vs. crystal corruption
- Can use Lay on Hands to temporarily suppress symptoms
- If corrupted, becomes single-minded about "protecting" Queen

## Interaction Log
### Session 1
- Met party at Pier 7 investigating crystallized corpse
- Recruited them to investigate plague
- Provided initial authority and resources

### Dialogue Examples
**Professional**: "Captain Brightshield, Harbor Watch. This is now a restricted area. State your business."

**Concerned**: "Three weeks of this plague and we're no closer to answers. People are scared, and scared people do desperate things."

**About the Queen**: "Her Majesty bears the weight of this crisis. We must find answers before... before it's too late."

**Under Pressure**: "I swore an oath to protect this city and its people. ALL its people. Even from themselves if necessary."

**If Trust Earned**: "Something's wrong at the palace. The Queen hasn't been herself. If you truly want to help, meet me at the old garrison at midnight. Come alone."

## Development Arc
1. **Sessions 1-3**: Professional, by-the-book captain
2. **Sessions 4-6**: Growing desperation and doubt
3. **Sessions 7-9**: Willing to break rules for greater good
4. **Session 10+**: Full rebellion against corrupted authority

## Notes for GM
- Use Lyanna to provide legitimate authority early
- Her romantic subplot adds personal stakes
- Can be the party's "inside person" for palace access
- Her corruption resistance makes her valuable late game
- If she dies, her guard unit may revolt or surrender based on party actions
