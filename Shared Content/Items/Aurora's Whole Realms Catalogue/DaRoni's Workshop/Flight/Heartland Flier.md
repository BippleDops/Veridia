[[um4a1t3s.mp0.png|open outside]]

**Price**: 45 gp.

**Speed**: can rise 25 ft per round and move at 15

**Crew**: 1

**Passengers**: 0

**Cargo (tons)**: -

## Description
I wished to make also a flier that lets one man fly alone, like the birds do. Lie prone on the heartboard with feet strapped into the [[Saddle|stirrups]] in back and hands strapped to [[Saddle|stirrups]] in front. Push the right foot and sweep with arms to draw wings down. Push the left foot and extend arms to draw wings up. (45 gp)

## Additional Details
chance of failure per round equals weight minus Str, Con, and Dex \[e.g., 120 lb - (Str 10 + Con 16 + Dex 14) = 80% chance of failure per round]; if successful, can rise 25 ft per round and move at 15; regular falling damage applies for failure; magical alteration to weight, Str, Con, and Dex apply
