--- # Demiplane

*Level 17 Bastion facility* - **Prerequisites**: Ability to use an [[arcane-focus-xphb (items)]] or tool as a [[spellcasting-focus-xphb (variant-rules)]]
- **Space**: Vast (36 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 1
- **Order**: empower A door up to 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall appears on a flat, solid surface in one of the other facilities in your Bastion. You choose the location. If you are in your Bastion during a Bastion turn, you can relocate this door to another facility in your Bastion. Only you and your Bastion's hirelings can open the door, which leads to a Demiplane that takes the form of a stone room. The Demiplane exists in an extradimensional space and therefore isn't attached physically to other locations in your Bastion. Neither the Demiplane nor its door can be dispelled. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Empower: Arcane Resilience When you issue the "Empower" order to this facility, magical runes appear on the Demiplane's walls and last for 7 days. Until the runes disappear, you gain [[temporary-hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] equal to five times your level after spending an entire Long Rest in the Demiplane. ## Fabrication While in the Demiplane, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to create a nonmagical object of your choice from nothing, causing it to appear in an unoccupied space in the Demiplane. The object can be no bigger than 5 feet in any dimension; can't have a value over 5 GP; and must be made of wood, stone, clay, porcelain, glass, paper, nonprecious crystal, or nonprecious metal. You must finish a Long Rest before you can take this action again. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 340* ## Player-Facing Summary Demiplane is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of demiplane as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around demiplane. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is protecting an heir for power
