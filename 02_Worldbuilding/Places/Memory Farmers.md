## Overview

The Memory Farmers represent one of [[Aquabyssos]]'s most disturbing and ethically controversial factions - individuals and groups who "farm" memories, experiences, and even consciousness itself from willing and unwilling subjects. Operating primarily from the shadows of the [[Memory Meadows Black Market]], these merchants in human experience trade in the most intimate aspects of sentient life.

Led by the enigmatic [[Memory Merchant Valeria|02 Worldbuilding/People/Memory Merchant Valeria]], the Memory Farmers have evolved from simple traders in nostalgic experiences to sophisticated operators capable of extracting, preserving, modifying, and implanting complex memory structures. Their practices range from consensual experience sharing to outright consciousness theft.

### The Emergence
Memory Farming began during the Second Age of Aquabyssos as an outgrowth of legitimate therapeutic practices. Early practitioners helped trauma victims by removing painful memories and assisted scholars by preserving important experiences. However, the lucrative nature of memory trading and the addictive qualities of certain experiences led to increasingly unethical practices.

### The Corruption Period
The faction's transformation into a criminal organization coincided with increased [[Aboleth Prime Yoth]] influence in the deep settlements. Aboleth manipulation techniques were adapted for memory extraction, leading to more sophisticated but far more invasive procedures.

### Modern Operations
Today's Memory Farmers operate a complex network spanning multiple depth levels, from legitimate memory preservation services for the wealthy to horrific consciousness farms in the deepest trenches where subjects are kept alive solely for continuous memory extraction.

### The Merchant Princes
**Memory Merchant Valeria**: Supreme leader, specializes in rare and ancient memories
**Memory Trader Kellian**: Handles bulk operations and large-scale extractions
**The Nostalgia Baron**: Anonymous figure controlling childhood memory markets
**Experience Empress Sorrow**: Deals in traumatic experiences and emotional memories

### Operational Divisions
**The Extractors**: Specialists who perform memory harvesting procedures
**The Cultivators**: Manage consciousness farms and long-term memory production
**The Artificers**: Create memory storage devices and implantation equipment
**The Dealers**: Handle distribution and sales through various markets

### Field Operations
**Memory Scouts**: Identify valuable subjects and map their experiences
**Consciousness Trappers**: Capture unwilling subjects for farming operations
**Market Guards**: Protect operations and eliminate threats
**The Forgotten**: Former subjects whose memories have been completely extracted

### Extraction Processes
**Voluntary Extraction**: Willing subjects sell specific memories or experiences
- Payment ranges from 100-10,000 gold pieces depending on rarity and intensity
- Standard contract includes memory modification to reduce trauma from loss
- Popular among desperate individuals seeking to forget painful experiences

**Parasitic Harvesting**: Long-term extraction from semi-willing subjects
- Subjects receive addictive substances while memories are slowly extracted
- Often disguised as therapeutic treatment for depression or trauma
- Can continue for years before subjects realize extent of memory loss

**Forced Extraction**: Kidnapped victims subjected to invasive procedures
- Utilizes techniques derived from [[02 Worldbuilding/Lore/Aboleth Mind Mazes|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/Aboleth Mind Mazes]]
- Subjects often left as empty shells or with fabricated replacement memories
- Most profitable method but highest risk of [[Parliament of Echoes]] intervention

### Memory Categories & Values

**Childhood Memories**: High demand, especially happy experiences (500-2,000 gp)
**First Love**: Extremely valuable romantic experiences (1,000-5,000 gp)
**Traumatic Events**: Specialized market for those seeking intense experiences (2,000-8,000 gp)
**Professional Skills**: Memories containing learned abilities (3,000-15,000 gp)
**Ancient Experiences**: Pre-drowning memories from elderly subjects (10,000+ gp)
**Unique Sensations**: One-of-a-kind experiences like magical phenomenon (varies wildly)

### Memory Extraction
**Willing Subject**: Constitution save DC 12, temporary Intelligence damage on failure
**Semi-Willing Subject**: Constitution save DC 16, permanent Intelligence damage possible
**Unwilling Subject**: Constitution save DC 20, severe psychological consequences

### Memory Implantation
**Compatible Memories**: Wisdom save DC 14 to integrate without personality changes
**Foreign Memories**: Wisdom save DC 18, risk of identity confusion
**Hostile Implants**: Wisdom save DC 22, potential possession or madness

### Addiction Mechanics
Subjects exposed to memory extraction chemicals must make Constitution saves:
- **First Exposure**: DC 10
- **Each Additional Exposure**: DC increases by 2
- **Failure**: Subject becomes dependent and seeks out more extractions

- **Recovery Units**: Attempt to restore stolen memories to victims

### Internal Conflicts
