## Secrets and Hidden Aspects

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Royal Exemption
> [[Chief Inspector Magnus Ledgerkeep]] has been secretly allowing certain royal shipments to pass through customs without proper inspection, on direct orders from [[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]. These shipments contain dangerous crystal corruption research materials that would be illegal for anyone else to import. Magnus is torn between his duty to the law and his loyalty to the crown, and is keeping detailed secret records of all exempted shipments in case he needs to protect himself politically.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Double Agent
> [[Senior Investigator Shadow Trackhound]] is actually a double agent working for a foreign intelligence service while maintaining his position in customs. He feeds information about Aethermoor's trade relationships and security procedures to his handlers while conducting legitimate anti-smuggling work to maintain his cover. His foreign contacts provide him with intelligence that makes him extremely effective at his job, creating a complex moral situation.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Crystal Communication Network
> The customs house's crystal communication system has been compromised by [[The Whisper Syndicate]], who have found a way to intercept and decode official communications. They use this intelligence for their criminal operations while being careful not to reveal their access. The syndicate has learned about several major customs operations in advance and has been selling this information to smugglers and other criminal organizations.
