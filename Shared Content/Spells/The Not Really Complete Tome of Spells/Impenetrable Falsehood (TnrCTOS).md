# Impenetrable Falsehood (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 12 hours


## Effects
You or one willing creature you touch becomes able to tell lies without being caught or stopped by mundane or magical means, including use of the Insight skill or spells such as *zone of truth.* In addition, anyone who reads your mind in order to find the truth must make an Intelligence saving throw; they only discover that you are lying if they succeed.

If cast on a creature who is in or who enters a *zone of truth*, that creature gains advantage on its saving throw, and the *zoneâ€™s* caster will be led to believe that that creature failed its saving throw, regardless of whether that creature failed or succeeded.
