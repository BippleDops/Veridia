## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing an adult or ancient silver dragon's lair is changed by its magic, creating the following effects:

- **Gentle Gusts.** Winds buoy creatures that fall within 1 mile of the lair. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no damage from falling.  
- **Sun and Storms.** While in its lair, the dragon can cast [[weather]], requiring no Material components and using the same spellcasting ability as its Spellcasting action.  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

## Player-Facing Summary

Silver dragon xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of silver dragon xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around silver dragon xmm.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
