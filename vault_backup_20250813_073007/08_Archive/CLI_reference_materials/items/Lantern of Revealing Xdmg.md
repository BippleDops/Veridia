# Lantern of Revealing
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/lantern-of-revealing.webp#right)


While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]] in a 30-foot radius and [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] for an additional 30 feet. [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Invisible|Invisible]] creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern's [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]]. You can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action to lower the hood, reducing the lantern's light to [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] in a 5-foot radius.
