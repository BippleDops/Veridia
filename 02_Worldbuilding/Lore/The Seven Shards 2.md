# The Seven Shards
*Fragments of Godhood Scattered Across the World*

> **For the Table:** The Seven Shards are your campaign's nuclear option - use them to escalate stakes, corrupt heroes, or offer terrible choices. Each shard should feel like handling unstable dynamite that whispers promises.

## Overview
When the Crown of Stars shattered during [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Crystallization, it broke into seven primary fragments, each containing a portion of [02_Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]] (Aetheron)'s divine essence. These Shards are the most powerful artifacts in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor, capable of granting godlike power or bringing about the world's destruction. Their growing activity may be connected to [02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Convergence Point]] between [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor and [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]].

## Player-Facing Summary

The Seven Shards is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of The Seven Shards as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Seven Shards.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties The Seven Shards to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at The Seven Shards to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to The Seven Shards active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
