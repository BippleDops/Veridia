## Description
Every autumn, rakes give farmers a giantâ€™s hand for harvest. In the north, we are the only suppliers of Chultian bamboo rakes (3 gp), with long and curving fronds that can gather up to 5 pounds of hay in a swipe. We also offer the more common twig rakes (2 sp) used currently throughout the heartlands.
