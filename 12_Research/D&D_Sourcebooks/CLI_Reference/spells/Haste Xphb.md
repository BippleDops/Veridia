# Haste
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's [[speed xphb|Speed]] is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to [[armor-class-xphb|Armor Class]], it has [[advantage xphb|Advantage]] on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used to take only the [[actions#Attack|Attack]] (one attack only), [[actions#Dash|Dash]], [[actions#Disengage|Disengage]], [[actions#Hide|Hide]], or [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action.

When the spell ends, the target is [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] and has a [[speed xphb|Speed]] of 0 until the end of its next turn, as a wave of lethargy washes over it.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
