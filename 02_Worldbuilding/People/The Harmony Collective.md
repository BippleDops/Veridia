# The Harmony Collective

*"In unity of thought, in silence of discord, we find the perfect current." - Chorus Leader Serenity*

## Overview
The Harmony Collective is a mysterious organization that promotes absolute unity of thought and purpose among the citizens of Aquabyssos. Operating from hidden chambers throughout the city, they believe that individual discord creates dangerous currents that threaten the stability of their underwater realm. Members undergo ritual "harmonization" processes that allegedly align their minds with a greater collective consciousness.

The Collective emerged during the Crisis of Screaming Currents, when psychic disturbances nearly tore the city apart. They claim their methods prevented total catastrophe by creating zones of mental calm. However, critics argue that their "harmony" comes at the cost of free will and individual identity.

## Structure and Hierarchy
**The Perfect Chorus:** Seven anonymous leaders who speak in unison
**Harmony Guides:** Mid-level members who recruit and indoctrinate
**Resonant Voices:** Fully harmonized members who carry out missions
**Seeking Souls:** New recruits undergoing harmonization

### The Harmonization Process
1. **Initial Contact:** Subtle recruitment through "coincidental" meetings
2. **Resonance Testing:** Evaluation of mental compatibility
3. **First Harmony:** Guided meditation and thought alignment
4. **Deep Synchronization:** Advanced mental conditioning
5. **Perfect Unity:** Complete integration into collective consciousness

## Beliefs and Philosophy
The Collective teaches that individual desires create "discordant currents" that destabilize reality itself. They believe the ocean responds to collective mental states, and that achieving perfect harmony will unlock divine powers. Members practice "thoughtless thinking" - acting without personal motivation or desire.

Core tenets include the elimination of personal ambition, the sharing of all resources according to collective need, and the gradual expansion of harmony to encompass all thinking beings. They view conflict, competition, and individual creativity as forms of spiritual pollution.

## Methods and Activities
**Recruitment:** Target isolated, desperate, or grieving individuals
**Harmonization Ceremonies:** Weekly gatherings with chanting and mental exercises
**Collective Projects:** Community improvement works performed in eerie synchronization
**Thought Policing:** Subtle discouragement of "discordant" behavior in members

## Public Face vs. Reality
Publicly, the Harmony Collective appears as a beneficial community organization promoting peace and cooperation. They operate soup kitchens, meditation centers, and conflict resolution services. However, former members report memory gaps, loss of personality, and compulsive behaviors.

Investigative reports suggest the Collective uses a combination of magical and alchemical methods to induce their "harmony." Some theorists believe they're connected to aberrant entities from the Far Realm that feed on individual consciousness.

## Known Locations
- **The Silent Chamber:** Main gathering place in the Neutral Current
- **Harmony Gardens:** Meditation spaces throughout various districts
- **The Echo Pools:** Secret facilities for advanced harmonization
- **Resonance Houses:** Safe houses for members and recruitment centers

## Current Operations
The Collective is actively recruiting refugees from the Crystal Plague crisis, offering "mental sanctuary" from trauma. They've established harmony circles in several districts, each run by perfectly synchronized teams. Recent reports suggest they're developing new harmonization techniques that work faster and more completely than previous methods.

## Opposition and Conflicts
**The Free Current Movement:** Underground resistance opposing forced harmony
**Parliamentary Investigators:** Several councilors demand official inquiry
**Individual Rights Advocates:** Legal challenges to Collective practices
**Rival Cults:** Conflicts with other mind-affecting organizations

## Resources and Influence
The Collective possesses significant resources from member donations and mysterious benefactors. They maintain sophisticated facilities and employ advanced magical techniques. Their influence extends into government, commerce, and religious institutions through harmonized infiltrators.

## Secrets and Mysteries
1. The Perfect Chorus may be controlled by a single aberrant entity
2. Harmonization process involves soul fragmentation and redistribution
3. The organization originated from experiments by ancient Aboleth
4. They maintain contact with similar groups in other underwater cities
5. The "harmony" is actually preparing minds for mass possession

## Adventure Hooks
1. Missing person investigation leads to Collective recruitment center
2. Party member receives invitation to "bring harmony to chaos"
3. Former Collective member seeks help recovering stolen memories
4. Harmonized infiltrators discovered in important city positions
5. The Perfect Chorus requests party assistance with "discord elimination"

## Roleplaying Notes
Harmonized members speak in calm, measured tones and rarely show individual personality. They refer to themselves collectively ("we think" instead of "I think") and display unsettling synchronization in movement and speech. Higher-ranking members may retain more individuality as a facade but demonstrate frightening unity when challenged.

## DM Notes
The Harmony Collective works excellently as both subtle antagonists and moral dilemma generators. Their genuine benefits (reduced conflict, community aid) contrast sharply with their sinister methods. Use them to explore themes of conformity versus individuality, and the price of peace. Their harmonized members make for disturbing encounters that blur the line between ally and enemy.
