## Description

An *arrow of slaying* is a [[Magic Weapon|magic weapon]] meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both *arrows of dragon slaying* and [[Arrows (20)|arrows]] *of blue dragon slaying*. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an *arrow of slaying* takes damage from the [[Arrows (20)|arrow]], the creature must make a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 17 [[Constitution|Constitution]] saving throw, taking an extra `dice: 6d10` (6d10) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once an *arrow of slaying* deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical [[Arrows (20)|arrow]].

Other types of magic Ammunition of this kind exist, such as *bolts of slaying* meant for a crossbow, though [[Arrows (20)|arrows]] are most common.
