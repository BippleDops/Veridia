# Entangle
*1st-level, Conjuration*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/entangle.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Grasping plants sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into [[Difficult Terrain Xphb]]. They disappear when the spell ends.

Each creature (other than you) in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a Strength saving throw or have the [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition until the spell ends. A [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] creature can take an action to make a Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself from the grasping plants and is no longer [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] by them.

**Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]
