## Sanctuary Charm

After spending a Long Rest in your Bastion, you gain a magical [[sanctuary-charm-xdmg|Charm]] (see ""Supernatural Gifts"" in "chapter 3") that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast [[healing-word-xphb|Healing Word]] once without expending a spell slot. You can't gain this Charm again while you still have it.

## Craft: Sacred Focus

When you issue the "Craft" order to this facility, you commission the facility's hireling to craft a [[druidic-focus-xphb|Druidic Focus]] ([[wooden-staff-xphb|wooden staff]]) or a [[holy-symbol-xphb|Holy Symbol]]. The work takes 7 days and costs no money. The item remains in your Bastion until you claim it.

## Player-Facing Summary

Sanctuary is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of sanctuary as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around sanctuary.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
