# Surface Sympathizer Settlements

*"Where forbidden dreams of sky and sun still burn bright."*

## Overview
Hidden communities throughout Aquabyssos where citizens who favor reconciliation with the surface world gather in secret. These settlements exist in the outer districts and abandoned areas, providing sanctuary for those who dare to question the kingdom's isolationist policies.

These communities face constant persecution from authorities who view surface sympathy as treasonous, forcing them to operate in absolute secrecy.
