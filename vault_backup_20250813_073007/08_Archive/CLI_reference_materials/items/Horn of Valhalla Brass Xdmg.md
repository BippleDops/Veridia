# Horn of Valhalla, Brass
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/horn-of-valhalla.webp#right)


You can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you. Each spirit uses the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/berserker-xmm|Berserker]] stat block and returns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]]. The spirits look like living, breathing warriors, and they have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/immunity-xphb|Immunity]] to the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] and [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Frightened|Frightened]] conditions. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

A brass horn summons 3 [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/berserker-xmm|Berserkers]]. To use the brass horn, you must have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb|Proficiency]] with all Simple weapons.

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/berserker-xmm|Berserkers]] attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/friendly-attitude-xphb|Friendly]] to you and your allies and follow your commands.
