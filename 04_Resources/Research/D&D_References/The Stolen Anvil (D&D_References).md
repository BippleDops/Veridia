The Stolen Anvil incident involves the theft of the legendary Deepforge Anvil, a magical smithing tool capable of creating underwater weapons and artifacts of unprecedented quality. The anvil's disappearance has crippled the city's crafting industry and created a black market for inferior goods. ## The Deepforge Anvil

**Origin:** Forged by the legendary smith Thalassic Ironbane centuries ago
**Properties:** Enables underwater metalworking, enhances magical item creation
**Size:** Massive - requires multiple people to move
**Value:** Priceless to crafters, estimated 50,000 gp replacement cost
**Unique Features:** Self-heating, water-resistant flames, increases success rates ## The Theft

**Location:** Master Smithy in the Crafters' Quarter
**Method:** Sophisticated magical teleportation during guild meeting
**Timing:** When all smiths were attending annual craftsmen's assembly
**Evidence:** Scorch marks and residual teleportation magic
**Suspects:** No witnesses, professional execution ## Investigation Progress

**Initial Response:** Guild hired private investigators
**Official Involvement:** City guard took over after pressure
**Magical Analysis:** Teleportation signature partially identified
**Interviews:** All guild members and rivals questioned
**Dead Ends:** Investigation stalled after three weeks ## Impact on Industry

**Production Decline:** Quality of smithed goods dropped significantly
**Economic Effects:** Prices increased, skilled smiths left city
**Guild Politics:** Internal disputes over replacement funding
**International Trade:** Aquabyssos lost competitive advantage
**Innovation Stagnation:** New techniques development halted ## Leading Theories

1. **Rival City Theft:** Competing underwater settlement sought advantage
2. **Corporate Espionage:** Merchant guild eliminated crafting competition
3. **Personal Vendetta:** Disgruntled former guild member seeking revenge
4. **Foreign Collection:** Surface world collector acquired exotic artifact
5. **Cult Activity:** Religious group needed anvil for prophetic weapon creation ## Current Situation

**Replacement Efforts:** Guild attempting to forge new anvil with limited success
**Black Market:** Inferior tools sold at premium prices
**Skill Migration:** Master crafters leaving for better opportunities
**Political Pressure:** Government demands resolution
**Underground Information:** Rumors of anvil sightings in distant locations ## Clues and Evidence

**Teleportation Residue:** Magic signature suggests expert spellcaster
**Timing Knowledge:** Thief knew exact schedule of guild meeting
**Professional Execution:** No evidence of amateur involvement
**No Ransom Demands:** Suggests theft for use rather than money
**International Interest:** Foreign inquiries about Aquabyssos crafting decline ## Recovery Efforts

**Reward Offered:** 10,000 gp for anvil's return
**International Appeals:** Diplomatic requests for assistance **Magical Tracking:** Ongoing scrying attempts to locate anvil
**Informant Networks:** Underground contacts seeking information
**Alternative Solutions:** Research into replacement magical techniques ## Adventure Hooks

1. Party hired to investigate and recover the stolen anvil
2. Anvil discovered in distant location requires retrieval mission
3. Thief contacts party offering to sell anvil back secretly
4. Investigation reveals anvil theft connected to larger conspiracy
5. Replacement anvil creation requires rare materials party must gather
6. Political intrigue surrounds coverup of who really stole anvil ## Long-term Implications

Without the anvil's return, Aquabyssos may lose its reputation as premier underwater crafting center. Economic decline could affect the entire region while crafting knowledge is lost to future generations. ## DM Notes
