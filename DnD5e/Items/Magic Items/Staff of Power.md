## Description

This [[staff]] can be wielded as a magic [[quarterstaff]] that grants a +2 bonus to [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to [[2 - Armor|Armor Class]], [[6 - Saving Throws|saving throws]], and [[2 - Casting a Spell|spell attack]] rolls.

The [[staff]] has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains `dice: 2d8+4` (2d8+4) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the [[staff]] retains its +2 bonus to [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] and damage rolls but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regains `dice: 1d8+2` (1d8+2) charges.

***Power Strike.*** When you hit with a melee [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] using the [[staff]], you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra `dice: 1d6` (1d6) [[17 - Damage and Healing|force]] damage to the target.

***Spells.*** While holding this [[staff]], you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] and [[2 - Casting a Spell|spell attack]] bonus: **[[cone of cold]]** (5 charges), **[[fireball]]** (5th-level version, 5 charges), **[[globe of invulnerability]]** (6 charges), **[[hold monster]]** (5 charges), **[[levitate]]** (2 charges), **[[lightning bolt]]** (5th-level version, 5 charges), **[[magic missile]]** (1 charge), **[[ray of enfeeblement]]** (1 charge), or **[[wall of force]]** (5 charges).

***Retributive Strike.*** You can use an action to break the [[staff]] over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius [[2 - Casting a Spell|sphere]] centered on it.

You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take [[17 - Damage and Healing|force]] damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the [[staff]]. Every other creature in the area must make a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 17 [[Dexterity]] saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

| **Distance from Origin** | **Damage**                             |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 10 ft. away or closer    | 8 × the number of charges in the staff |
| 11 to 20 ft. away        | 6 × the number of charges in the staff |
| 21 to 30 ft. away        | 4 × the number of charges in the staff |

**Versatile**. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
