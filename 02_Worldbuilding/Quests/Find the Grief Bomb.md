# Find the Grief Bomb

**Type:** Investigation/Horror  
**Level:** 8-12  
**Location:** [[Abyssos Prime - Inverse Palace]], [[The Archive of Unremembered Things]]  
**Duration:** 3-4 sessions  
**Threat:** Psychological warfare device threatens to destroy collective memory

## Overview
The [[Order of the Drowned Star]] has developed a horrifying weapon called the "Grief Bomb" - a crystalline device that forces entire populations to experience profound, paralyzing sorrow. Intelligence suggests it's hidden somewhere in the [[Abyssos Prime - Inverse Palace]], designed to be detonated during a major political gathering to cripple [[Aquabyssos]]'s leadership permanently.

## Background
[[High Inquisitor Maltheos]] discovered plans for the Grief Bomb in captured [[Shadow Surgeons Collective]] documents. The weapon works by amplifying traumatic memories and projecting them into the minds of everyone within a 2-mile radius. Victims become catatonic with grief, reliving their worst losses on an endless loop.

## Key NPCs
- **[[Anti-Priest Nullus]]**: Fanatical creator of the Grief Bomb, believes suffering purifies
- **[[Memory Merchant Zephyr Mindweaver]]**: Has crucial intelligence about memory-based weapons
- **[[Vault Keeper Eternal]]**: Knows the location of emotion-dampening artifacts
- **[[Time-Lost Delegate Chronus]]**: Witnessed similar weapons in other timelines

## Investigation Phases

### Phase 1: Gathering Intelligence (1 session)
**Location:** [[Port Meridian - Harbor District]]  
**Objective:** Learn about the weapon and its potential hiding places

**Key Locations:**
- **[[The Archive of Unremembered Things]]**: Contains research on emotional manipulation magic
- **[[Shadow Market Canals]]**: Black market dealers selling "extracted sorrows"
- **[[Parliament of Echoes - Shadow Chamber]]**: Infiltrate to access classified reports

**Clues to Find:**
1. **Crystalline Resonance Patterns**: The bomb uses modified [[Seven Shards]] fragments
2. **Memory Harvesting Equipment**: Strange surgical tools found in raids
3. **Timeline Anomalies**: Temporal distortions around the palace suggest active magic
4. **Emotional Residue**: Psychic investigators detect "grief shadows" in certain areas

### Phase 2: The Palace Infiltration (1-2 sessions)
**Location:** [[Abyssos Prime - Inverse Palace]]  
**Objective:** Navigate the twisted architecture to locate the bomb

**Challenges:**
- **Inverted Gravity**: Rooms where "down" points in different directions
- **Memory Traps**: Corridors that force characters to relive painful memories
- **Emotion Guards**: Constructs that become stronger when characters feel despair
- **Temporal Loops**: Some rooms repeat the same tragic moment endlessly

**Key Areas:**
- **[[Inverted Ballroom Wing - Party Quarters]]**: Social events provide cover for investigation
- **[[Palace Courtyard - Crystal Garden]]**: Crystalline growths here resonate with the bomb
- **[[Throne Room - Heart of Palace]]**: The ultimate target location for the weapon

### Phase 3: The Confrontation (1 session)
**Location:** [[The Original Palace]] (accessed through reality tears)  
**Objective:** Stop [[Anti-Priest Nullus]] from activating the Grief Bomb

## The Grief Bomb
**Appearance:** A 3-foot crystalline sphere covered in carved faces showing expressions of loss  
**Activation:** Requires a ritual involving the sacrifice of cherished memories  
**Range:** 2-mile radius of psychic devastation  
**Duration:** Permanent until dispelled with extreme magical intervention

### Grief Bomb Effects
When activated, all creatures in range must make DC 20 Wisdom saves or be affected by:
- **Paralyzing Grief**: Incapacitated, can only weep and mourn
- **Memory Amplification**: Traumatic memories feel fresh and overwhelming
- **Emotional Contagion**: The grief spreads to anyone who interacts with victims
- **Despair Aura**: Hope becomes literally impossible to feel

## Defusing the Bomb
**Requirements:**
1. **[[Temporal Navigation]] expertise** to access the bomb's temporal core
2. **Memory healing magic** to repair fractured emotional channels
3. **Crystal singing techniques** learned from [[The Singing Trenches]]
4. **Pure joy essence** harvested from [[Memory Farmers]] who cultivate happiness

**Skill Challenges:**
- **Arcana DC 20**: Understand the crystalline matrix binding emotions
- **History DC 18**: Recognize the ancient grief rituals being perverted
- **Performance DC 22**: Counter-sing the grief harmonics with joy melodies
- **Medicine DC 19**: Heal the psychic damage accumulating in the area

## Combat Encounter: Anti-Priest Nullus
**CR 11** (7,200 XP)

**Abilities:**
- **Grief Aura**: All creatures within 30 feet have disadvantage on saves against fear and charm
- **Sorrow Spike**: Ranged attack that forces target to relive their worst memory
- **Despair Shield**: Takes half damage while any creature within 60 feet is frightened or charmed
- **Final Grief**: When reduced to 0 hp, triggers a localized grief bomb explosion

**Tactics:** Nullus tries to activate the bomb while summoning manifestations of the party's regrets and losses to distract them.

### Story Rewards

- **Temporal Clearance**: [[Time-Lost Delegate Chronus]] shares timeline secrets

## Consequences

### Success
- The [[Order of the Drowned Star]] is exposed and hunted by authorities
- [[Memory Farmers]] develop new techniques to heal emotional trauma
- Party gains reputation as protectors of Aquabyssos's mental well-being
- [[Anti-Priest Nullus]]'s defeat weakens grief-based magic across the realm

### Failure
- Mass psychological devastation cripples [[Abyssos Prime]] leadership
- [[The Deep Mother]] takes advantage of the chaos to expand her influence
- Surviving officials become paranoid and authoritarian to prevent future attacks
- The party must live with the knowledge that they could have prevented immense suffering

## Connected Adventures

- **[[Investigate Shadow Surgeons]]**: Leads to understanding how the weapon was created
- **[[Memory Farmers]]**: These NPCs become important allies for healing aftermath

## DM Notes

### Themes
- **The weaponization of emotion and memory**
- **How societies process collective trauma**
- **The balance between security and freedom**
- **The power of joy and hope in the face of despair**

### Pacing Tips
- **Session 1**: Focus on investigation and growing dread as the scope becomes clear
- **Session 2-3**: Palace infiltration with mounting tension and personal memory challenges
- **Session 4**: Fast-paced climax with emotional stakes and technical defusal challenges

### Customization
- Adjust the grief effects based on character backstories for maximum impact
- Consider having NPCs the party cares about be affected by test runs of the weapon
- The bomb's location can be moved to other significant locations based on campaign needs

> [!danger] DM Secret
> The Grief Bomb contains a fragment of [[The Deep Mother]]'s consciousness, making it partially sentient and capable of adaptive tactics. It "learns" from each attempt to defuse it, becoming harder to stop with repeated failure.
