# Party Information

*"Know your allies, for in the depths, trust flows deeper than blood."*

## Overview
Party Information encompasses the tracking and management of adventuring group dynamics, character relationships, shared resources, and collective reputation throughout both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. This system goes beyond basic character statistics to include political affiliations, cultural connections, and the complex web of alliances and enemies that develop during inter-realm adventures.

## Historical Background
As adventuring groups began operating across both realms, the need for comprehensive party tracking became apparent. Traditional surface-based adventure records proved inadequate when dealing with underwater politics, pressure-based social hierarchies, and the fluid nature of aquatic alliances.

## Current State
Modern party information systems track reputation across multiple factions, cultural adaptation levels, magical corruption exposure, and the complex relationships formed during inter-realm adventures. This data influences NPC reactions, available opportunities, and potential consequences.

## Cultural Impact

### Aquabyssos
Underwater society views party composition and dynamics as crucial indicators of trustworthiness and competence. Mixed surface-underwater parties are seen as symbols of cooperation or suspicion depending on political climate.

### Aethermoor
Surface dwellers increasingly recognize the value of diverse party composition when dealing with inter-realm challenges. Traditional adventuring party roles have expanded to include cultural liaisons and depth adaptation specialists.

## Mechanics

### Requirements
- Regular tracking of party actions and consequences
- Documentation of faction relationships and reputation changes
- Monitoring of character development and cultural adaptation
- Recording of shared resources and magical corruption exposure

### Effects
- **Reputation Tracking**: Actions affect entire party standing with various factions
- **Resource Sharing**: Collective equipment and knowledge databases
- **Cultural Buffers**: Party members can compensate for others' cultural gaps
- **Corruption Resistance**: Group support helps resist individual corruption effects

### Duration
Ongoing campaign element requiring constant updates and maintenance.

## Notable Examples
- **The Tidecrest Alliance**: Multi-realm party that achieved legendary status
- **The Depth Walkers**: Surface party that successfully integrated underwater members
- **The Current Riders**: Underwater group that adapted to include surface allies

## Key Figures
- **Party Tracker Marina Recordflow**: Expert in inter-realm party dynamics
- **Chronicler Stone Memorydeep**: Maintains historical party achievement records
- **Guide Captain Swift Currentborn**: Specialist in mixed-realm party coordination

## Mysteries
- Why certain party combinations seem naturally lucky or unlucky
- The role of destiny in party formation and composition
- Whether some parties share psychic connections across realms

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Identity Crisis**: Party members must prove their collective innocence
2. **Reputation Recovery**: Repair damaged standing with crucial faction
3. **Legacy Investigation**: Research the history of a legendary party

## Secrets (DM Only)
Some long-term adventuring parties develop subtle magical bonds that allow limited telepathic communication and shared magical resistance.

## Player-Facing Summary

Party Information is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Party Information as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Party Information.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
