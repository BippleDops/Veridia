# Goldspire Confederacy
*The Golden Reach of Maritime Commerce*

## Overview

The Goldspire Confederacy represents one of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s most significant foreign partners and potential threats - a maritime commercial empire built on trade networks, financial manipulation, and technological innovation. Located across the eastern ocean from [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Azure Coast]], this confederation of merchant city-states has transformed from a regional trading partner into a major international power with increasingly sophisticated methods of economic and political influence.

Led by the enigmatic Trade Prince Aurelius Gilt, the Confederacy operates on the principle that economic control is more effective than military conquest. Their recent involvement in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s financial difficulties through [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/Economic Warfare]] represents a new evolution in their expansion strategy - conquest through debt rather than force.
