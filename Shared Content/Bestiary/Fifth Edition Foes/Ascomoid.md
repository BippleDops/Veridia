## Special Traits
**Trample:** As the ascomoid moves, it can enter spaces occupied by enemies but can't stop there. Creatures in spaces the ascomoid enters can attempt DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, on a failed save, the creature takes 15 (`dice: 2d10+4`) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone; on a successful save, the creature moves 5 feet to get out of the ascomoid's path and can make an opportunity attack if it's allowed to react. An ascomoid can attempt to trample any number of creatures during its move, but it can't trample the same creature more than once per round.

## Actions
**Melee Attack—Slam:** +6 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 3d8 + 3` bludgeoning damage.

**Area Attack—Spores (recharge 5, 6):** automatic hit (20-ft. radius sphere within 30 ft. range; creatures in sphere). Hit: creatures in the sphere must make a successful DC 16 Con save against poison or take `dice: 2d6` poison damage and become nauseated (incapacitated) for `dice: 1d4` rounds. A successful save negates the poison damage but not the incapacitated condition, and also makes the creature immune to further spore attacks from the same ascomoid for 24 hours.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Underground

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
Ascomoids are subterranean fungus monsters. They feed by sitting atop a slain creature and absorbing its body fluids into the ascomoid’s own form. Creatures slain in this manner appear as rotting husks.

Ascomoids generally avoid light and the surface world, though they have no adverse reaction to sunlight or bright light. The typical ascomoid lair is a large, damp, dark, natural cavern with only one way in or out. Bones from its victims are strewn about the lair. The monster has no use for treasure, but the possessions of those it killed tend to be scattered loosely all over its lair. Fragile items tend to be destroyed by the ascomoid’s great weight as it feeds.

The average ascomoid is 10 feet wide and weighs 300 pounds.
