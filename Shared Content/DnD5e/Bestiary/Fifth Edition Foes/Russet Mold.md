## Special Traits
**Camouflage:** From a distance of 10 feet or more, russet mold is indistinguishable from the normal rust stains that are often seen in damp dungeons and caves. On closer inspection (within 10 feet), it can be identified with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check. Once characters are familiar with it (theyve had a prior encounter with russet mold), it can be identified automatically, but this identification still requires close inspection.

## Actions
**Spores:** *Area Attack:* automatic hit, range 5 ft. radius, all creatures in radius. Hit: each target must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take `dice: 2d6` poison damage and become poisoned. While poisoned, a creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the poisoned condition ends; on a failed save, the creature takes another 7 (`dice: 2d6`) poison damage. A creature that dies from this poison damage reanimates 24 hours later, transformed into a vegepygmy commoner. The spores remain active in a dead creatures body, so if a creature is restored to life before it reanimates, it is still poisoned and it continues taking poison damage until the poison is neutralized magically or by a successful save.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Underground

**Organization**: Solitary or patch (2–5)

## Description
Russet mold thrives in dark, wet areas. It looks nearly identical to the rust streaks and stains that can be found in every cave or dungeon where water trickles down the walls and forms puddles on the floor. When a living creature gets within 5 feet, however, the russet mold “coughs” out a burst of spores that forms a cloud 15 feet in diameter, centered on the russet mold. This cloud contains a deadly, mutagenic poison that not only kills creatures unfortunate enough to be caught in it, but transforms them into vegepygmies.

A patch of russet mold is 5 to 7 feet in diameter.

Acid is by far the most effective way to kill a patch of russet mold. If none is available, alcohol can also be used, but it does just 2 points of damage per gallon, or 1 point per gallon if beer or wine are used.

## Additional Details
