## Description
Among the most prominent and ubiquitous of the temple’s accoutrements are candlesticks, of all varieties and types. Our gold (20 gp) and silver (12 gp) foot-tall candlesticks are crafted by Waterdhavian smiths and can accommodate [[2.

For gods who love light, we carry 6-[[2.

Hooded candlesticks provide a 90% chance per round to stay lit in strong winds, 50% in gales.
