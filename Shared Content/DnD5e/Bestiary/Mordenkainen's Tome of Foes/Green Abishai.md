## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting.*** The abishai's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At Will: *alter self, major image*
3/day each: *charm person, detect thoughts, fear*
1/day each: *confusion, dominate person, mass suggestion*

***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the abishai's darkvision.

***Magic Resistance.*** The abishai has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The abishai's weapon attacks are magical.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The abishai makes two attacks, one with its claws and one with its longsword, or it casts one spell from its Innate Spellcasting trait and makes one claw attack.

***Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 ( `dice: 1d8+1`) slashing damage, or 6 ( `dice: 1d10+1`) slashing damage if used with two hands.

***Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 12 ( `dice: 2d8+3`) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 11 ( `dice: 2d10`) poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Description
The envoys of Tiamat's armies, green abishais represent the god's interests in the Nine Hells and beyond. Their keen senses make them adept at discovering secrets and other sensitive information, while their diplomatic skills and their magic ensure that they can manipulate even the shrewdest opponents.
