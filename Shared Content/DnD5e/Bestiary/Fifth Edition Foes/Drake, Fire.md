## Special Traits
**Pyrophoric Blood:** A fire drake's blood is highly flammable; it ignites in a burst of flame on contact with air. A creature that makes a successful melee attack with a slashing or piercing weapon (including natural weapons) against a fire drake must make a successful DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (`dice: 1d6`) fire damage from the splashing blood.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A fire drake bites once and attacks once with claws, or it uses its breath weapon.

**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature,. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d8+1`) piercing damage.

**Claws:** *Melee Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (`dice: 2d6+1`) slashing damage.

**Fiery Breath (Recharge 5—6):** The fire drake exhales fire in a 20-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (`dice: 2d10`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate and warm hills and mountains

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, clutch (2–6), or family (6–8)

## Description
Fire drakes lair in caves and caverns deep within the hills and mountains. They are viciously territorial, fighting any other significant carnivores that move into their area. The only competitors they tolerate are other fire drakes, but even in those cases, very little provocation is needed to set them against their own kind. On occasion, a mated pair is encountered, but only in late summer or early autumn.

Fire drakes are often mistaken for young or miniature red dragons. A typical fire drake is 4 feet long, but some as much as 6 feet long have been reported. They prefer to open combat with their flame breath. Once expended, they rely on their bite and razor-sharp claws.
