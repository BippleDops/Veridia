## Overview
High Inquisitor Maltheos leads the [[Purist Coalition]], a growing religious and political movement dedicated to eradicating crystal corruption from Aethermoor. A brilliant theologian and charismatic orator, he genuinely believes that crystal technology represents a fundamental corruption of divine order. His uncompromising crusade against crystal use puts him on a collision course with [[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]] and the entire royal establishment, though he remains unaware that his ultimate enemyâ€”the Queen herselfâ€”suffers from the very corruption he seeks to destroy.

#### **[[Purist Coalition]] - The Growing Movement**

**Historical Development**:
- **Early Ministry (15 years ago)**: Began as simple priest preaching against excessive crystal use
- **The Corruption Witness**: Personally witnessed family members die from crystal corruption, radicalizing his views
- **Movement Formation**: Organized scattered anti-crystal groups into unified political force
- **Growing Influence**: Coalition now commands significant political power and popular support

**Coalition Structure**:
- **Religious Wing**: Clergy and devoted believers providing spiritual authority
- **Political Wing**: Nobles and merchants whose interests align with anti-crystal policies
- **Popular Wing**: Common people who have suffered from crystal corruption effects
- **Military Wing**: Soldiers and officers who see crystals as security threat

**Coalition Tactics**:
- **Religious Authority**: Uses theological arguments to challenge royal crystal policies
- **Political Pressure**: Organizes noble opposition to royal initiatives
- **Popular Mobilization**: Mass rallies and demonstrations against crystal expansion
- **Economic Warfare**: Boycotts and trade disruption against crystal-dependent businesses

#### **Brother Marcus Steelbane - The Militant Arm**

**Historical Development**:
- **Early Recruitment**: Maltheos personally recruited Marcus after the plague crisis
- **Military Organization**: Marcus leads the Coalition's more militant activities
- **Street Operations**: Coordinates anti-crystal protests and direct action
- **Enforcement Role**: Ensures Coalition discipline and handles "problem" members

**Operational Relationship**:
- **Plausible Deniability**: Marcus handles operations Maltheos cannot officially endorse
- **Strategic Coordination**: Regular planning sessions for Coalition activities
- **Resource Support**: Maltheos provides funding and religious authority for Marcus's operations
- **Moral Justification**: Maltheos provides theological cover for increasingly extreme actions

#### **[[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]] - The Unwitting Enemy**

**Historical Development**:
- **Early Opposition**: Began challenging royal crystal policies during first years of Seraphina's reign
- **Growing Antagonism**: Each royal pro-crystal initiative sparked stronger Coalition response
- **Personal Animosity**: Sees Seraphina as corrupted by power and crystal influence
- **Current Crisis**: Coalition pressure threatens royal authority while Seraphina hides her actual corruption

**Past Conflicts**:
- **The Crystal Academy Dispute**: Publicly opposed royal funding for crystal research institutions
- **The Trade Route Battle**: Organized opposition to expanded crystal commerce
- **The Medical Research Controversy**: Challenged royal support for crystal-based medical treatments

**Political Warfare**:
- **Theological Challenges**: Uses religious authority to question royal legitimacy
- **Popular Mobilization**: Organizes public opposition to royal policies
- **Noble Alliance**: Builds coalition of nobles opposed to royal crystal policies
- **Economic Pressure**: Coordinates boycotts and trade disruption

**The Hidden Irony**: 
- **Unknowing Accuracy**: His accusations about royal corruption are accidentally true
- **Misplaced Focus**: Attacks Seraphina for wrong reasons while being fundamentally correct
- **Dangerous Truth**: If he discovers Seraphina's actual corruption, it would vindicate his entire movement

#### **[[Lord Aurelius Goldwave]] - The Complicated Opposition**

**Historical Development**:
- **Initial Respect**: Early admiration for Aurelius's wealth and apparent piety
- **Growing Suspicion**: Aurelius's support for royal crystal policies created tension
- **Philosophical Conflict**: Both seek to end corruption but through opposite means
- **Current Opposition**: Sees Aurelius as corrupted by wealth and royal influence

**Ideological Conflict**:
- **Method Disagreement**: Maltheos seeks destruction while Aurelius seeks redemption
- **Resource Competition**: Both seek the Seven Shards for opposite purposes
- **Political Maneuvering**: Aurelius uses wealth to counter Maltheos's religious authority
- **Hidden Knowledge**: Neither knows the other's true motivations and secret goals

#### **Orthodox Clergy Alliance**

**Traditional Religious Authority**:
- **Conservative Priests**: Clergy who support traditional religious practices over crystal innovation
- **Rural Ministers**: Country priests who see crystal technology as urban corruption
- **Temple Hierarchy**: Some senior religious figures who provide institutional support

- **Information Warfare**: Spreading anti-crystal propaganda and disinformation
- **Economic Disruption**: Coordinated actions to damage crystal-dependent businesses
- **Political Pressure**: Behind-the-scenes threats and blackmail against pro-crystal officials

#### **The Succession Strategy**

- **Alternative Authority**: Building Coalition as alternative to royal government
- **Military Recruitment**: Secret recruitment within army and navy units
- **Regional Support**: Developing strongholds in areas most affected by crystal corruption
