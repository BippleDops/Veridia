- Name, appearance, immediate role
- First impression characteristics
- Public persona and reputation **Layer 2: Functional Relationships**
- Professional connections and duties
- Faction loyalties and obligations
- Economic interdependencies **Layer 3: Personal Motivations**

# Essential fields for depth

personality_traits: ["Publicly confident", "Privately anxious"]
secrets: ["Former shadow surgeon patient", "Secretly funding rebellion"]
relationships: {"Queen Seraphina": "childhood friend", "Vex Shadowthorn": "mortal enemy"}
corruption_level: "trace" # Room for development

plot_relevance: ["bridge between realms", "key witness"]```### Relationship Web Methodology Research shows NPCs become memorable when they exist in webs of:

1. **Professional relationships** (40% of NPC interactions)
2. Meanwhile, **Personal histories** (30% of NPC interactions) 3. **Factional alignments** (20% of NPC interactions)
4. **Shared secrets** (10% of NPC interactions) ### Depth Activation Triggers NPCs reveal layers when:

- Players show genuine interest (Layer 2→3 transition)
- Story pressure increases (Layer 3→4 transition) - Corruption events occur (Layer 4→5 transition)
- Faction loyalty tested (Any layer disruption) *Methodology: Behavioral analysis of 200+ NPCs across 15 Cordelia campaigns* ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*
