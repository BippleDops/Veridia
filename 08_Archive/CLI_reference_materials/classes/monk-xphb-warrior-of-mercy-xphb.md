## Class Features

### Warrior of Mercy (Level 3)

*Manipulate Forces of Life and Death*

Warriors of Mercy manipulate the life force of others. These Monks are wandering physicians, but they bring a swift end to their enemies. They often wear masks, presenting themselves as faceless bringers of life and death.

### Hand of Harm (Level 3)

Once per turn when you hit a creature with an [Unarmed Strike](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/unarmed-strike-xphb.md) and deal damage, you can expend 1 Focus Point to deal extra Necrotic damage equal to one roll of your Martial Arts die plus your Wisdom modifier.

### Hand of Healing (Level 3)

As a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action, you can expend 1 Focus Point to touch a creature and restore a number of [Hit Points](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) equal to a roll of your Martial Arts die plus your Wisdom modifier. When you use your Flurry of Blows, you can replace one of the Unarmed Strikes with a use of this feature without expending a Focus Point for the healing.

### Implements of Mercy (Level 3)

You gain proficiency in the [Insight](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Insight) and [Medicine](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Medicine) skills and proficiency with the [Herbalism Kit](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/herbalism-kit-xphb.md).

### Physician's Touch (Level 6)

Your Hand of Harm and Hand of Healing improve, as detailed below.

#### Hand of Harm

When you use Hand of Harm on a creature, you can also give that creature the [Poisoned](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition until the end of your next turn.

#### Hand of Healing

When you use Hand of Healing, you can also end one of the following conditions on the creature you heal: [Blinded](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Blinded), [Deafened](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Deafened), [Paralyzed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Paralyzed), [Poisoned](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned), or [Stunned](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Stunned).

### Flurry of Healing and Harm (Level 11)

When you use Flurry of Blows, you can replace each of the Unarmed Strikes with a use of Hand of Healing without expending Focus Points for the healing.

In addition, when you make an [Unarmed Strike](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/unarmed-strike-xphb.md) with Flurry of Blows and deal damage, you can use Hand of Harm with that strike without expending a Focus Point for Hand of Harm. You can still use Hand of Harm only once per turn.

You can use these benefits a total number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a [Long Rest](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md).

### Hand of Ultimate Mercy (Level 17)

Your mastery of life energy opens the door to the ultimate mercy. As a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action, you can touch the corpse of a creature that died within the past 24 hours and expend 5 Focus Points. The creature then returns to life with a number of [Hit Points](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) equal to `4d10` plus your Wisdom modifier. If the creature died with any of the following conditions, the creature revives with the conditions removed: [Blinded](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Blinded), [Deafened](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Deafened), [Paralyzed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Paralyzed), [Poisoned](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned), and [Stunned](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Stunned).

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a [Long Rest](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md).
