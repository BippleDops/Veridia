# Arrow-Catching Shield
*Armor ([[Shield]]), rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

You gain a +2 bonus to [[armor-class-xphb (variant-rules)]] against ranged attack rolls while you wield this Shield. This bonus is in addition to the Shield's normal bonus to AC.

Whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack roll against a target within 5 feet of you, you can take a [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules)]] to become the target of the attack instead.
