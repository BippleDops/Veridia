## Description
This spice comes from the forbidding interior of Tâ€™u Lung where few western travelers, save myself, have ventured. Similar in size and flavoring to peppercorns, fagara possesses the unique addition of a mild tingling numbness. So powerful is the effect that a little will serve for even the largest dish. (100 gp/lb.)
