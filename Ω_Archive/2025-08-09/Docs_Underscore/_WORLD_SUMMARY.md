# World Summary for AI Context
*A comprehensive guide to the dual-world campaign setting*

## üåç Aethermoor (Surface World)

### Core Concept
A once-prosperous kingdom facing a mysterious crystal plague that transforms citizens into crystalline statues. This transformation is actually the first symptom of dimensional convergence with the drowned realm of Aquabyssos.

### The Crystal Plague Crisis
- **Duration**: 3 weeks and spreading rapidly
- **Affected**: 500+ citizens in Port Meridian alone

### The Seven Shards Mystery

## üåä Aquabyssos (Underwater Realm)

### The Drowned History
- **The Cataclysm**: Surface empire triggered reality inversion
- **Adaptation**: Citizens transformed to survive crushing depths
- **Shadow Separation**: Consciousness split between body and shadow

- **Sorrow Pearls**: Crystallized grief used as currency
- **Temporal Variance**: Different time flow at different depths

## üîÑ Crossover Elements

## üåê Universal Mechanics

### Transformation Systems
Both worlds feature body horror transformation:
