# The Crimson Sage
*The Wandering Scholar, Keeper of Forgotten Truths*

## Overview
The Crimson Sage appears as a mysterious scholar researching crystal corruption and ancient history. In truth, they are Aetheron, the shattered God-King whose crown became the Aether Crystals. Stripped of most divine power and trapped in mortal form, they seek to understand what they have become and perhaps find redemption—or revenge.

## Appearance
- **Visible**: Elderly human, flowing crimson robes, silver hair
- **Height**: 5'10" (variable)
- **Eyes**: Change color based on mood (gold when using power)
- **Staff**: Ancient wood wrapped with crystal veins
- **True Form**: Glimpses of divine radiance, countless fractal reflections

## Personality
- **Surface**: Wise, cryptic, helpful but mysterious
- **Deep**: Tormented by loss, wrestling with godhood memories
- **Motivations**: Complex and contradictory
- **Speech**: Speaks in metaphors and half-truths

## The Truth
> [!warning] Ultimate Secret - DM Only
> The Crimson Sage is Aetheron, the God-King whose crown shattered 500 years ago. When the Seven Advisors betrayed him, the shattering scattered his essence across the crystals. He reformed as this diminished mortal form, retaining knowledge but not omnipotence. He both created and is victim of the crystal corruption.

## Abilities & Powers

### Remaining Divine Aspects
- Cannot die (reforms if killed)
- Sense all Aether Crystals
- Limited reality manipulation
- Perfect memory of past events
- Can enter dreams

### Mortal Limitations

- Emotions cloud judgment

### Magical Abilities
- Master of all schools of magic
- Can safely handle corrupted crystals
- Knows true names of things
- Can grant boons or curses

## Relationships

- [[The Oracle of the Sundered Peaks]] - Former high priestess
- [[2-World/People/Vex Shadowthorn]] - Complicated history

### The Seven Betrayers (Now Dead)

## Secrets Within Secrets
> [!warning] DM Only - Layers of Truth
> 1. **Level 1**: Mysterious sage researching corruption
> 2. **Level 2**: Immortal being with knowledge of the Shattering
> 3. **Level 3**: Is actually Aetheron, the shattered god
> 4. **Level 4**: Orchestrating events to reclaim godhood
> 5. **Level 5**: Genuinely uncertain if godhood should be reclaimed
> 6. **Level 6**: The corruption might be his subconsious attempt at reunion with creation

## Current Activities
- Providing selective truth to multiple factions
- Searching for the Seventh Shard
- Conducting experiments on corruption reversal
- Manipulating events toward unknown end
- Writing the true history in hidden texts

## Multiple Identities
- **The Crimson Sage** - Wandering scholar
- **Master Aldwyn** - Reclusive researcher in [[2-World/Places/The Sundered Peaks]]
- **The Whispered One** - Mythical figure in criminal underworld
- **Brother Clemens** - Humble priest in small villages

## Motivations (Conflicting)
1. Restore the Crown and reclaim godhood
2. Prevent the Crown's restoration to protect mortals
3. Understand what he has become
4. Seek revenge on descendants of betrayers
5. Find peace in mortality
6. Save those corrupted by his essence

## Knowledge He Possesses
- Location of five of the Seven Shards
- True cure for crystal corruption
- How to safely destroy crystals
- The coming convergence
- Every secret in this document

## Quest Hooks
1. Appears to offer cryptic guidance
2. Needs items retrieved from dangerous locations
3. Tests party with moral dilemmas
4. Provides maps to ancient sites
5. Warns of coming catastrophes

## Speaking Style
*"Every crystal contains a fragment of divinity—and divinity, I've learned, can be a terrible burden."*

*"The crown was not broken. It was... distributed. The question is whether it should be gathered again."*

*"I have walked this world for five centuries, and still mortality surprises me."*

*(When revealing partial truth) "I was there when the crown shattered. I saw the sky weep crystals."*

## Combat Approach
- Avoids combat through misdirection
- If forced: overwhelming magical force
- Prefers to teach lessons than destroy
- Will flee rather than reveal true nature
- If "killed": Returns in new identity

### Stats (Beyond Mortal Measurement)

- **HP**: 200 (regenerates)

2. Knowledge of Shard locations
3. Understanding of crystal magic
4. Visions of the past
5. Divine spark (dangerous)

## DM Notes
