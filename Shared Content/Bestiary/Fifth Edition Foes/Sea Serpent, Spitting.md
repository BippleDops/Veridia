## Description
The sea serpents, great snakelike creatures that have roamed the oceans for ages, are nearly as old as the dragons that roam the sky. Unlike dragons, these great, scaly, serpentine beasts are products of natural evolution, though many scholars suspect magical influence, either deliberate or natural, somewhere in their evolution.

Sea serpents display great variation in size, color, intellect, and temperament. All of them, however, bear certain similarities. They are long, serpentine, warmblooded creatures that resemble snakes in appearance, though they also have two sets of flippers. On some sea serpents, these flippers are large and powerful, while on others they are so small and atrophied as to be almost unnoticeable. All sea serpents are aquatic, as their name implies, but they can survive for extended times out of water and some can even make their way about on land. Furthermore, all sea serpents are sentient, with intellects ranging from that of a smart dolphin to levels rivaling the smartest humans.

One trait that sea serpents share with dragons is a sense of innate superiority, a feeling that they are unequalled, unchallenged masters of the sea.

Unlike dragons, sea serpents are not distinguished by color or age. A few species are as acquisitive as dragons, but most have no interest in hoarding wealth or surrounding themselves with worshipful, lesser creatures. All sea serpents can speak and understand Aquatic, and many know Draconic as well. The more intelligent among them often learn the languages of nearby marine civilizations or the languages of seagoing surface dwellers.

In combat, most sea serpents use similar tactics. All have venomous bites, and all have the ability to trap prey in their coils and crush the life out of them the way a giant constrictor snake does. The largest sea serpents can even crush ships this way; mariners in their smoky dens delight in recounting tales of horror about great serpents that splintered mighty hulls and then gulped down the helpless sailors as they splashed in the water or sank into the brine.

Because they are intelligent, sea serpents can often be reasoned with or bargained with, if the bargainer has something the sea serpent wants and approaches as a supplicant, not an equal. They are adaptable to circumstances and never throw themselves into battle rashly.

Spitting sea serpents are a fiercely territorial if not terribly intelligent species that can be a great hazard along coastlines. They are renowned for their ability to spit gobs of acidic spittle onto creatures that threaten them. Their spittle is just as dangerous underwater as through the airâ€” and they have been known to spit at people on the decks of ships and on docks, wharfs, and beaches. Being able to move (slowly) on land, they sometimes hunt along the shore, killing creatures with their spit and then crawling onto land to retrieve the carcass and drag it back to the sea.

Spitting sea serpents dwell in shallow coastal water and and avoid deep water, where they sometimes fall prey to larger sea serpents and other gigantic sea predators such as giant squids or octopi. They are most often found in water well away from high-traffic shipping lanes, because sailors kill them on sight, too. Remote stretches of coast are where spitting sea serpents are most likely to be encountered.
