*Rod, very rare* - **Weight**: 2.0 lbs. While holding this rod, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a demiplane. You choose the form the demiplane takes. It could be a tranquil garden, a cheery tavern, an immense palace, a tropical island, a fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the demiplane contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors, and the demiplane's environment can't harm its occupants. Everything else that can be interacted with there can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden there disappears if it is taken outside the demiplane. For each hour spent in the demiplane, a visitor regains [hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] as if it had spent 1 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules) Die. Also, creatures don't age while there, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain there for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down). When the time runs out or you take a [actions#Magic|Magic]] action to end the effect, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod or an unoccupied space nearest that location. Once used, this property can't be used again until 10 days have passed. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 301.
