# Tinderstrike
*Weapon ([dagger](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/dagger-xphb.md)), legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/tinderstrike.webp#right)

- **Damage**: 1d4 piercing
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [Finesse](/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties.md#Finesse), [Light](/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties.md#Light), [Thrown](/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties.md#Thrown)
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

A flint dagger, Tinderstrike is uncommonly sharp, and sparks cascade off its edge whenever it strikes something solid. Its handle is always warm to the touch, and the blade smolders for `d4` minutes after it is used to deal damage. It contains a spark of [Imix](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/imix-pota.md), Prince of Evil Fire.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra `2d6` fire damage.

## Fire Mastery

You gain the following benefits while you hold Tinderstrike:

- You can speak Ignan fluently.  
- You have resistance to fire damage.  
- You can cast [dominate monster](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/dominate-monster-xphb.md) (save DC 17) on a [fire elemental](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/fire-elemental-xmm.md). Once you have done so, Tinderstrike can't be used this way again until the next dawn.  

## Dance of the All-Consuming Fire

While inside a fire node, you can perform a ritual called the Dance of the All-Consuming Fire, using Tinderstrike to create a [devastation orb of fire](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/devastation-orb-of-fire-pota.md). Once you perform the ritual, Tinderstrike can't be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn.

## Flaw

Tinderstrike makes its wielder impatient and rash. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I act without thinking and take risks without weighing the consequences."
