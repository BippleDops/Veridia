## Overview
Titus Goldcurrent controls the largest ficial institution in [[Aquabyssos]], the **Deep Vault Banking Consortium**. From his coral-carved office in the ficial district, he orchestrates loans, investments, and currency exchanges that shape the economic fate of both realms. Behind his respectable facade lies a cunning manipulator who uses debt as a weapon and ficial leverage as chains, ensuring that anyone who needs capital eventually finds themselves dancing to his tune.

## Background
Born into a modest merchant family, Titus showed early aptitude for numbers and negotiation. He built his fortune through a combination of shrewd investments, strategic marriages (and strategic divorces), and carefully orchestrated ficial manipulation. His rise to power came during the **Crystal Currency Crisis** fifteen years ago, when he cornered the market on stable currency exchange and emerged as the most trusted ficial authority in both realms.

## Secrets
> [!warning] DM Only
> - Artificially manipulates currency exchange rates for profit
> - Owns secret shares in most "competitor" banks, creating a monopoly
> - Has been embezzling from the Imperial Treasury for over a decade
> - Maintains detailed blackmail files on every major political figure
> - His "charitable donations" are actually bribes disguised as philanthropy
> - Plans to crash both realm economies to consolidate absolute ficial control
> - Has a hidden vault containing enough wealth to buy a small kingdom

## Motivations
1. **Primary**: Accumulate wealth and ficial control over both realms
2. **Secondary**: Establish a banking dynasty that will outlast him
3. **Hidden**: Create economic conditions that make him indispensable to rulers
4. **Personal**: Prove that money is the ultimate source of all power

## Business Holdings
**The Deep Vault Banking Consortium** includes:
- **Main Branch**: Fortified coral structure in ficial district
- **Currency Exchange**: Controls all inter-realm money conversion
- **Investment Services**: Manages wealth for nobles and merchants
- **Loan Division**: Predatory lending with magical enforcement
- **Collection Agency**: Enforcers who retrieve debts by any means necessary

## Quest Hooks
1. **The Crushing Debt** - PCs inherit massive debt and must work for Titus to pay it off
2. **The Bank Heist** - Either rob Titus or help him stage a fake robbery for insurance
3. **The Corruption Investigation** - Uncover his illegal activities while avoiding his retaliation
4. **The Economic War** - Two realms' economies are manipulated; stop his grand scheme
5. **The Devil's Contract** - Magical contracts are trapping people; break the binding system
6. **The Rival's Revenge** - Madame Coral Deepsafe hires PCs to expose his crimes
7. **The Imperial Audit** - Emperor's investigators are closing in; will PCs help or hinder?
8. **The Whistleblower** - Former employee seeks protection while revealing his secrets
