## ⚠️ Notes on Special Directories

- **08_Archive**: Contains ONLY archived/old content, not active game materials
- **09_Performance**: Contains ONLY reports, analytics, and logs, not game content

## 🔍 Categorization Intelligence

The system analyzed files based on content patterns:

### NPC Detection
- Must have: race, class, personality, alignment, stats
- Must not have: district, building, location terms

### Location Detection
- Must have: location, district, building, landmark, region
- Must not have: NPC, personality, class, race

### Quest Detection
- Must have: quest, adventure, mission, objective, reward
- Must not have: NPC stats, location descriptions

### Item Detection
- Must have: item, weapon, armor, potion, artifact, rarity
- Must not have: NPC, location, quest terms
