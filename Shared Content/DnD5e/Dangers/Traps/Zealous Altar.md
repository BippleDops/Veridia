# Zealous Altar
## Overview
*Magical trap*
This altar bears the symbol of the patron god of its creator. Any creature who can see the altar who is not wearing a visible holy symbol of the altar's god must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. Creatures who fail are blinded and deafened for 8 hours or until the altar is destroyed. Creatures who succeed are immune to the altar's effects for 24 hours.

A creature trained in Religion who makes a DC 15 Intelligence (Wisdom) check knows the nature of the altar. The altar is made of a magically treated metal and much tougher than it looks. It has AC 22 and 200 hit points.
