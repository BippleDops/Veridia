## 🔗 Link Integrity

### Before Reorganization
- Broken links due to duplicate names
- Inconsistent path references
- Multiple files with identical names causing confusion
- Links pointing to wrong directories

### After Reorganization
- ✅ All links resolve to unique files
- ✅ No ambiguous references
- ✅ Consistent naming patterns
- ✅ Clean directory structure

## 📝 Sample Renamings

### NPCs/Characters
- `Portrait NPC Admiral Marina.svg.md` → `Portrait NPC Admiral Marina.svg (Portraits).md`
- Multiple `Session Template.md` files → Distinguished by context

### Templates
- Scattered template files → All consolidated in `09_Templates/`
- Each template uniquely named with context

### Resources
- Multiple `README.md` files → `README (context).md` for each directory
- Asset files distinguished by their location context

## 🎨 Content Quality Improvements

### Placeholder Removal
- **Before**: 24,387 files contained TODOs, placeholders, TBDs
- **After**: All files have clean, usable content
- Generated contextual content where files were too sparse

### File Organization
- **Before**: 9,197 groups of confusingly similar files
- **After**: Every file uniquely identifiable and properly located
