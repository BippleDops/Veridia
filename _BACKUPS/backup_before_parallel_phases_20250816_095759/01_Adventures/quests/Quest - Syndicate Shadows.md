Quest - Syndicate Shadows moves information and influence like currency. Publicly pragmatic, privately driven by a personal stake in the Convergence’s shape. - Ideal: Stability through controlled risk.
- Bond: A family archive tied to [[Lighthouse_of_Storms|Lighthouse of Storms.
- Flaw: Overconfidence in leverage; underestimates zealots and true believers. ## Player-Facing Summary Quest Syndicate Shadows is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Quest Syndicate Shadows as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Quest Syndicate Shadows. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A corpse reveals a betrayal about the cult
