## Description

The dracohydra is the result of arcane experimentation dedicated to recreating Tiamat's power. Amalgamating the magic of chromatic dragons with the blood of a hydra resulted in a many-headed draconic monster with wings and multiple snakelike tails. The dracohydra's breath weapon is a multicolored mass of energy that contains the essence of a chromatic dragon's elemental power.

These gluttonous creatures' appearance heralds disaster for any region they settle in, as they feed relentlesslyâ€”with each head demanding a feast of its own. If left alone, they hunt the local fauna almost to extinction, then move on to threatening the folk of nearby settlements.

A dracohydra can sometimes be found in the service of the spellcaster who created it, kept obedient by the rituals of their creation.
