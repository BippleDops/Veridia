--- ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary README FUTURE WORK is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of README FUTURE WORK as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around README FUTURE WORK. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A merchant needs help investigating before dawn

- A stranger needs help investigating before the festival
- An heirloom has gone missing and evil awakens
- A corpse reveals the truth about a local noble ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
