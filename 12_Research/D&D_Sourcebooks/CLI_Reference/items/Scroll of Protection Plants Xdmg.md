# Scroll of Protection (Plants)
*Scroll, rare*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/scroll-of-protection.webp#right)

Using a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to read the scroll creates a 5-foot [[Area of Effect Xphb]] originating from you. For 5 minutes, {{item.detail2}} can't enter or affect anything in the area. However, if you move in such a way that an Plant would be inside the area, the effect ends.

As a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, a creature within 5 feet of the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] can attempt to overcome it, which forces the creature to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the creature ceases to be affected by the [[Area of Effect Xphb]].
