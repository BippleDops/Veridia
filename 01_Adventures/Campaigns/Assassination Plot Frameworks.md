*The Art of Political Elimination in the Depths* > *"In Aquabyssos, political murder is an art form where the weapon matters less than the water it displaces, and the killer matters less than the current that carries their escape."*

Political assassination in Aquabyssos has evolved unique methods adapted to underwater existence, shadow manipulation, memory theft, and temporal anomalies. These frameworks provide systematic approaches to political elimination that account for the realm's supernatural and technological complexities. #### Type A: Direct Elimination

**Objective:** Physical death of target
**Methods:** Violence, poison, accident, environmental hazard
**Difficulty:** Medium to High
**Political Impact:** Maximum - creates martyrs and clear succession #### Type B: Identity Assassination

**Objective:** Destruction of target's identity/credibility without death
**Methods:** Memory theft, reputation destruction, shadow replacement
**Difficulty:** High
**Political Impact:** High - removes influence while avoiding martyrdom #### Type C: Political Neutralization

**Objective:** Remove target from political power without physical harm
**Methods:** Blackmail, exile, legal prosecution, forced retirement
**Difficulty:** Medium
**Political Impact:** Medium - temporary removal, potential for return #### Type D: Conversion Assassination

**Objective:** Transform target into asset working against original interests
**Methods:** Mental manipulation, shadow replacement, family threats
**Difficulty:** Very High
**Political Impact:** Maximum - enemy becomes ally while maintaining credibility ### Framework Alpha: The Pressure Accident

*Classic environmental elimination using water pressure* #### Method Overview

1. **Preparation Phase:** Study target's routine, identify pressure vulnerability windows
2. **Setup Phase:** Sabotage pressure equipment or manipulate environmental controls
3. **Execution Phase:** Create situation requiring target to enter dangerous pressure zone
4. **Escape Phase:** Ensure death appears accidental, eliminate evidence ### Framework Beta: The Shadow Replacement

*Perfect assassination through identity substitution* #### Method Overview

1. **Study Phase:** Comprehensive personality analysis, behavioral mapping, relationship documentation
2. Additionally, **Preparation Phase:** Create perfect shadow duplicate, eliminate potential witnesses
3. **Replacement Phase:** Eliminate original, install shadow in their place
4. **Integration Phase:** Shadow assumes identity permanently, serves new agenda ### Framework Gamma: The Memory Theft Murder

*Assassination through systematic memory extraction* #### Method Overview

1. **Access Phase:** Gain physical or psychological access to target
2. **Extraction Phase:** Systematic removal of memories, starting with recent and working backward
3. **Completion Phase:** Complete memory extraction results in brain death or catatonia
4. **Utilization Phase:** Use extracted memories for blackmail or intelligence ### Framework Delta: The Temporal Elimination

*Assassination using time distortion effects* #### Method Overview

1. **Temporal Mapping:** Identify temporal anomalies near target's routine locations
2. **Manipulation Phase:** Enhance or redirect temporal effects to create lethal situations
3. **Execution Phase:** Target encounters temporal distortion resulting in death or displacement
4. **Temporal Cleanup:** Use time effects to eliminate evidence or create alibis ### Framework Epsilon: The Corruption Revelation

*Assassination through systematic reputation destruction* #### Method Overview

1. **Investigation Phase:** Discover or create evidence of target's corruption or criminal activity
2. **Documentation Phase:** Compile comprehensive evidence package with verification
3. **Revelation Phase:** Strategic release of information to maximize damage
4. **Destruction Phase:** Public disgrace leads to political death and potential physical threats ### The Leviathan "Accident"

**Method:** Use trained sea creatures to eliminate targets during "routine" encounters
**Cover:** Natural predation or territorial behavior
**Requirements:** Monster handler, creature access, plausible encounter setup ### The Crystal Plague Infection

**Method:** Deliberate infection with crystal corruption during medical treatment
**Cover:** Natural disease progression or medical malpractice
**Requirements:** Medical access, crystal corruption source, time for development ### The Drowning God's Judgment

**Method:** Use religious ceremony to eliminate target through "divine intervention"
**Cover:** Religious accident or divine punishment
**Requirements:** Religious authority, ceremony access, supernatural manipulation ### The Memory Tide Erasure

**Method:** Time assassination attempt with natural memory tide for evidence destruction
**Cover:** Natural phenomenon affecting investigation
**Requirements:** Temporal prediction, memory tide access, precise timing ### The Shadow War Casualty

**Method:** Frame target's death as casualty in ongoing shadow conspiracy conflict
**Cover:** Shadow violence or political terrorism
**Requirements:** Shadow cooperation, conflict escalation, misdirection ### The Parliamentary Purge

**Objective:** Eliminate multiple senators simultaneously
**Method:** Coordinate various assassination types during single event
**Cover:** Terrorist attack, natural disaster, or political crisis
**Impact:** Reshape entire political landscape ### The House War Decimation

**Objective:** Eliminate key members of rival noble house
**Method:** Systematic family-targeted assassinations over time
**Cover:** Family curse, disease, or accident pattern

**Method:** Time multiple unrelated factors to create assassination opportunity
**Investigation Resistance:** So many contributing factors that assassination appears impossible to coordinate
**Example:** Political rally + environmental disaster + family emergency + security failure ### The Natural Progression Method

**Method:** Accelerate natural death causes rather than introducing new ones
**Investigation Resistance:** Death appears from natural causes, just accelerated
**Example:** Enhance existing heart condition during stressful political situation ### The Chaos Multiplication Strategy

**Method:** Create multiple concurrent crises to overwhelm investigation resources
**Investigation Resistance:** Limited investigation capability spread across multiple incidents
**Example:** Simultaneous accidents, political scandals, and security breaches ### The False Pattern Technique

**Method:** Create apparent assassination pattern while real method is different
**Investigation Resistance:** Investigators focus on wrong methodology
**Example:** Stage several poison attempts while real method is memory extraction ### Protection Scenarios
