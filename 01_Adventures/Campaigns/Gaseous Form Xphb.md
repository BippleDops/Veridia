--- # Gaseous Form

*3rd-level, Transmutation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of gauze)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour A willing creature you touch shape-shifts, along with everything it's wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends on the target if it drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] or if it takes a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to end the spell on itself. While in this form, the target's only method of movement is a [[Fly Speed Xphb]] of 10 feet, and it can hover. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The target has [[boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats)]] to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage; it has [[immunity-xphb (variant-rules)]] to the [[conditions#prone|Prone]] condition; and it has [[Advantage Xphb]] on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through narrow openings, but it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target can't talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. Finally, the target can't attack or cast spells. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 3. **Classes**: [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 277.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of gaseous form xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around gaseous form xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is protecting an heir for money
