# The Whispering Peaks
*Where the Dead Never Rest*

## Overview

The Whispering Peaks rise from the northern waters of [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] like the spines of some ancient, slumbering leviathan. These jagged mountains breach the surface in defiance of [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Great Drowning]], their peaks shrouded in perpetual mist that carries the voices of countless souls who perished during the cataclysm. The winds here don't merely blow - they speak, carrying fragments of final words, dying prayers, and unfinished promises across the treacherous slopes.

This haunted archipelago serves as both sanctuary and prison for the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Orders/Order of Azure Flame]], warrior-monks who have dedicated themselves to shepherding the restless dead and guarding against the whispers that threaten to drive visitors to madness.
