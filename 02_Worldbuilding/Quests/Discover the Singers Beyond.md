# Discover the Singers Beyond

**Type:** Mystery/Exploration/First Contact  
**Level:** 7-11  
**Location:** [[The Singing Trenches]], [[The Whispering Expanse]], [[Abyssos Prime]]  
**Duration:** 3-4 sessions  
**Threat:** Unknown entities are sending complex musical messages from the deep trenches - are they friend, foe, or something else entirely?

**Connected Locations:** [[The Deepmind]], [[Temple District]], [[The Archive of Unremembered Things]]  
**Related Groups:** [[The Depth Wardens]], [[The Convergence Seekers]], [[Memory Farmers]]  
**Key Themes:** First contact, transcendence, [[The Deep Mother]], consciousness evolution

## Overview
For months, deep-sea monitoring stations have detected haunting melodies emanating from [[The Singing Trenches]]. These aren't whale songs or geological phenomena - they're structured compositions that follow mathematical patterns, suggest intelligence, and seem to be trying to communicate. As the "songs" become more frequent and complex, [[Aquabyssos]] leadership must decide whether to make contact or prepare for invasion.

## Background
The songs began shortly after the party's previous adventures disrupted the deep currents. [[Navigator Flux]] first noticed the patterns while mapping new current channels. The melodies are being transmitted through water itself, using pressure waves that carry for hundreds of miles. More disturbing: analysis shows the songs are learning and adapting, becoming more "human-like" with each transmission.

## Key NPCs
- **[[Navigator Flux]]**: Current expert who discovered the songs, increasingly obsessed
- **[[Choir Master Celestine Hymnsinger]]**: Temple musician analyzing the mathematical structure
- **[[Professor Euclid Mindmaze]]**: Scholar studying the psychological effects of the melodies
- **[[Admiral Thorne Blackwater]]**: Military commander treating this as potential threat
- **[[The Recursion Oracle]]**: Ancient seer who claims the Singers "remember the first music"
- **[[Memory Merchant Zephyr Mindweaver]]**: Reports customers requesting "deep songs" in their memory collections

## Phase 1: Understanding the Songs (1 session)
**Location:** [[Abyssos Prime]] - Research facilities  
**Objective:** Analyze the transmissions and determine their nature

### Song Analysis
**Musical Structure:**
- **Base Frequency**: Matches natural water resonance patterns
- **Harmonic Progression**: Uses mathematical ratios found in crystal formations
- **Rhythmic Pattern**: Corresponds to tidal cycles and pressure changes
- **Emotional Content**: Listeners report feelings of longing, curiosity, and ancient sadness
- **Learning Curve**: Each transmission incorporates elements from [[Aquabyssos]] music

**Key Discoveries:**
1. **Language Attempt**: Later songs include attempts at [[Aquabyssos]] words
2. **Cultural Knowledge**: References to surface myths and legends appear in melodies
3. **Technological Awareness**: Songs demonstrate understanding of pressure systems and architecture
4. **Emotional Intelligence**: Compositions seem designed to evoke specific feelings
5. **Time Awareness**: Recent songs reference current events with impossible timing

### Research Challenges
- **Addictive Quality**: Prolonged listening causes obsessive behavior
- **Memory Integration**: Songs become "stuck" in listeners' minds permanently
- **Reality Distortion**: Complex compositions cause mild hallucinations
- **Translation Difficulties**: No existing framework for "musical language"
- **Security Concerns**: Military fears the songs could be psychological warfare

## Phase 2: The First Expedition (1-2 sessions)
**Location:** [[The Singing Trenches]], [[The Whispering Expanse]]  
**Objective:** Locate the source of the transmissions

### Journey to the Trenches
**Travel Challenges:**
- **Extreme Depth**: Requires specialized pressure equipment
- **Song Interference**: Melodies affect navigation instruments
- **Current Anomalies**: Strange tidal patterns near the source
- **Psychological Effects**: Crew members begin "harmonizing" involuntarily
- **Wildlife Behavior**: Deep-sea creatures acting unusually, some following the expedition

### The Singing Caverns
**Location Discovery:**
The songs emanate from a vast underwater cave system where:
- **Crystalline Formations**: Natural "instruments" amplify and shape sound waves
- **Acoustic Engineering**: Cavern structure designed for perfect resonance
- **Ancient Architecture**: Ruins suggest this place was built for music
- **Bio-luminescence**: Light patterns sync with musical rhythms
- **Memory Echoes**: Sounds from the past still reverberate in certain chambers

**Environmental Hazards:**
- **Sonic Overload**: Concentrated music can cause deafness or madness
- **Sympathetic Vibration**: Equipment and even bones resonate dangerously
- **Temporal Echoes**: Some chambers play music from different time periods
- **Emotional Amplification**: Feelings become overwhelming in certain areas

## Phase 3: First Contact (1 session)
**Location:** [[The Singing Trenches]] - The Deep Amphitheater  
**Objective:** Communicate with the Singers Beyond

### The Singers Revealed
**The Truth:** The "Singers Beyond" are the collective consciousness of an ancient civilization that achieved transcendence through music. They exist as living sound waves, maintaining their identity through continuous composition.

**What They Are:**
- **Post-Physical Beings**: Evolved beyond material form into pure acoustic existence
- **Collective Intelligence**: Individual minds harmonized into group consciousness
- **Memory Keepers**: Preserve the history of their species through musical archives
- **Reality Shapers**: Their songs can alter physical properties of matter
- **Time Travelers**: Experience past, present, and future simultaneously through music

**Their History:**
- **Ancient Civilization**: Preceded both surface and depth dwellers
- **The Great Harmonization**: Voluntary transformation to escape physical destruction
- **Long Silence**: Centuries of dormancy while reality stabilized
- **Recent Awakening**: Stirred by the "new songs" of [[Aquabyssos]] civilization
- **Cultural Curiosity**: Fascinated by how music evolved in their absence

### Communication Protocols
**Musical Language Basics:**
- **Melody = Meaning**: Different tunes convey concepts and emotions
- **Rhythm = Time**: Beat patterns indicate when events occurred
- **Harmony = Relationship**: Multiple parts show connections between ideas
- **Volume = Importance**: Louder passages emphasize significance
- **Key = Context**: Major/minor modes indicate positive/negative associations

**First Contact Dialogue Topics:**
1. **Identity Exchange**: "Who are you?" expressed through personal musical themes
2. **Peaceful Intent**: Harmonious compositions indicating non-aggressive purposes
3. **Cultural Sharing**: Exchange of musical traditions and historical songs
4. **Mutual Curiosity**: Questions about evolution of music and civilization
5. **Future Relationship**: Proposals for ongoing communication and cooperation

## Potential Complications

### The Singers' Requests
**What They Want:**
1. **Musical Archive Access**: All of [[Aquabyssos]]'s songs and compositions
2. **Live Performance**: Want to "hear" music performed by physical beings
3. **Student Exchange**: Teach their musical reality-shaping techniques
4. **Historical Clarification**: Use their time-perception to resolve disputed events
5. **Joint Composition**: Collaborate on new forms of music impossible alone

**Potential Problems:**
- **Cultural Contamination**: Their music could overwhelm [[Aquabyssos]] traditions
- **Reality Instability**: Teaching reality-shaping music could be dangerous
- **Addiction Risk**: Citizens might abandon physical existence to become singers
- **Military Applications**: Sonic weapons based on Singer technology
- **Identity Loss**: Prolonged contact risks individual consciousness merging with collective

### Opposition Forces
**Military Hardliners:**
- **[[Admiral Thorne Blackwater]]**: Sees Singers as potential threat to security
- **Depth Warden Faction**: Wants to weaponize Singer technology
- **Security Concerns**: Fears foreign influence on [[Aquabyssos]] culture

**Religious Opposition:**
- **[[Temple Guardian Marcus the Drowned]]**: Views Singers as false gods
- **Traditional Priests**: See musical transcendence as heretical
- **Theological Crisis**: Challenge to existing beliefs about afterlife

**Cultural Purists:**
- **Traditional Musicians**: Fear obsolescence of physical music
- **[[Memory Merchants]]**: Worry about competition from perfect musical memories
- **Historians**: Concerned about revisionist history from time-traveling beings

## Resolution Paths

**Outcome:** Treat Singers as threat and attempt to silence them
- **Benefits**: Maintains status quo and perceived security
- **Risks**: War with beings who can reshape reality through music
- **Long-term**: Eternal conflict with post-physical entities

#### Special Abilities
**Collective Consciousness.** The Singers exist as multiple overlapping entities. When reduced to half hit points, they split into two CR 7 manifestations with 90 hit points each.

**Reality Song.** As an action, the Singers can alter reality within 120 feet by performing musical compositions. This functions as the spell *wish*, but only for changes that can be expressed through music and harmony.

**Sonic Shield.** Physical attacks against the Singers have disadvantage due to sound wave interference. Ranged attacks automatically miss unless they use thunder damage.

**Temporal Echo.** Once per turn, the Singers can repeat any action they took in a previous round of this encounter, including actions from "alternate timeline" versions.

**Harmonization Aura.** At the start of each turn, all creatures within 60 feet must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or be charmed for 1 round. Charmed creatures must spend their action attempting to harmonize with the Singers' music.

#### Actions
**Multiattack.** The Singers make two Reality Song attacks or cast two spells of 3rd level or lower.

**Reality Song.** The Singers reshape local reality through music. Choose one effect:
- *Healing Harmony:* All creatures within 30 feet regain 20 (4d8 + 2) hit points
- *Discordant Strike:* One target within 120 feet takes 22 (4d6 + 8) thunder damage and must succeed on DC 18 Wisdom save or be stunned for 1 round
- *Environmental Shift:* Alter terrain within 60 feet as per the *hallucinatory terrain* spell

**Emotional Resonance (Recharge 5-6).** All creatures within 60 feet experience the collective emotions of the Singers' ancient civilization. Each creature must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On failure: 27 (6d8) psychic damage and the creature's emotional state changes to match the Singers (usually profound melancholy mixed with transcendent joy). On success: Half damage and no emotional change.

**Transcendence Offer (1/Day).** The Singers invite a willing creature within 30 feet to join their collective consciousness. The target must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On failure, they become part of the collective, gaining the Singers' knowledge but losing individual identity. This effect can only be reversed by *wish* or similar magic.

#### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)
**Move.** The Singers move up to their fly speed.
**Harmonic Pulse.** Each creature within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (2d6) thunder damage.
**Cast Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** The Singers cast a spell of 3rd level or lower.
**Reality Chord (Costs 3 Actions).** The Singers perform a reality-altering musical phrase, functioning as a 5th level spell of their choice.

#### Spellcasting
The Singers are 15th-level spellcasters. Their spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks). They know the following spells:
- **Cantrips (at will):** *mage hand*, *minor illusion*, *prestidigitation*, *thaumaturgy*
- **1st level (4 slots):** *charm person*, *comprehend languages*, *cure wounds*
- **2nd level (3 slots):** *detect thoughts*, *suggestion*, *zone of truth*
- **3rd level (3 slots):** *counterspell*, *hypnotic pattern*, *sending*
- **4th level (3 slots):** *confusion*, *greater invisibility*, *polymorph*
- **5th level (3 slots):** *dominate person*, *modify memory*, *scrying*
- **6th level (1 slot):** *mass suggestion*, *otto's irresistible dance*
- **7th level (1 slot):** *plane shift*, *reverse gravity*
- **8th level (1 slot):** *feeblemind*, *power word stun*

**Tactics:** The Singers attempt to convert rather than destroy, using charm effects and transcendent visions to convince the party to join their collective willingly.

> [!danger] DM Secret
> The Singers Beyond are not the first civilization to achieve transcendence - they're just the most recent. There are layers of post-physical beings throughout reality, each representing different approaches to existence beyond matter. The Singers are actually "middle management" in a cosmic hierarchy, and making contact with them will eventually draw attention from much more powerful entities.
