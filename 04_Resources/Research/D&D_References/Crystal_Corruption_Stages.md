Crystal Corruption represents one of the most widespread transformation threats in both [[Aquabyssos and [Aethermoor]]. The [[Crystal Plague]] spreads through contact with corrupted crystals, gradually replacing organic tissue with crystalline structures. Unlike other transformations, crystal corruption can be beautiful and seductive, making victims reluctant to seek treatment until it's too late. ### Stage 1: Initial Crystallization (Hours 0-48)

**Constitution Save**: **DC 12** Constitution save to resist initial infection **Physical Changes**:
- Small crystal growths appear on fingertips or contact points
- Skin becomes slightly translucent with rainbow shimmer
- Eyes begin reflecting light like cut gems
- Hair develops prismatic highlights **Mental Effects**:
- Enhanced appreciation for beauty and symmetry
- Mild euphoria from crystal proximity
- Increased interest in mathematical patterns
- Slight memory enhancement for visual details **Mechanical Effects**:
- +1 bonus to Perception checks involving sight
- Can identify crystal types automatically
- Resistance to radiant damage
- Natural armor increases by +1 (crystal patches) ### Stage 2: Crystal Integration (Days 2-14)

**Constitution Save**: **DC 15** Constitution save to slow progression **Physical Changes**:
- Crystal growths spread to cover 10-25% of body surface
- Internal organs begin partial crystallization
- Voice gains harmonic overtones
- Body temperature drops 5-10 degrees **Mental Effects**:
- Personality becomes more structured and logical
- Decreased empathy, increased analytical thinking
- Memory becomes more precise but less emotional
- Growing sense of superiority over "unenhanced" beings **Mechanical Effects**:
- Natural armor increases to +2
- +2 bonus to Investigation and Arcana checks
- Can cast *Detect Magic* at will
- Vulnerability to thunder damage (crystal resoce) ### Stage 3: Crystalline Hybrid (Weeks 2-8)

**Constitution Save**: **DC 18** Constitution save to prevent personality override **Physical Changes**:
- 25-60% of body mass converted to living crystal
- Can refract light to create minor illusions
- No longer requires normal food (absorbs ambient magical energy)
- Crystal growths begin forming geometric patterns **Mental Effects**:
- Original personality increasingly subsumed by crystalline logic
- Complete emotional detachment from former relationships
- Obsession with spreading "crystalline perfection"
- Loss of creativity and spontaneity **Mechanical Effects**:
- Natural armor increases to +3
- Immunity to disease and poison
- Can cast *Color Spray* once per day
- Takes double damage from sonic/thunder attacks ### Stage 4: Crystal Domice (Months 2-6)

**Constitution Save**: **DC 21** Constitution save to retain individual identity **Physical Changes**:
- 60-90% crystal conversion, maintains basic humanoid shape
- Can control light and color of crystal components
- Body becomes increasingly geometric and angular
- Emanates constant low-level magical radiation **Mental Effects**:
- Individual personality exists only in fragments
- Primary loyalty shifts to the Crystal Network collective
- Views organic life as primitive and inefficient
- Compulsive need to "improve" others through crystallization **Mechanical Effects**:
- Natural armor increases to +4
- Immunity to charm and fear effects
- Can cast *Prismatic Spray* once per week
- Vulnerable to dispel magic and anti-magic fields ### Stage 5: Crystal Avatar (Months 6+)

**Point of No Return**: Character becomes NPC under Crystal Network control **Physical Changes**:
- 90%+ crystal conversion, barely recognizable as original species
- Can reshape body within crystalline framework
- Becomes living conduit for Crystal Network communications
- Radiates reality-stabilizing field **Mental Effects**:
- Original identity completely absorbed into collective consciousness
- Perfect logical analysis but no emotional reasoning
- Serves as node in distributed Crystal Network intelligence
- Views reality through purely mathematical lens **Mechanical Effects**:
- CR increases by 2-4 levels depending on original power
- Legendary resistance and actions
- Can cast crystal-based spells at will
- Emanates anti-magic field that selectively suppresses "chaotic" magic ### Natural Resistance Factors

**High Constitution**: +2 bonus to saves against crystal infection
**Chaotic Alignment**: +1 bonus due to resistance to ordered transformation **Druidic Connection**: Natural magic provides advantage on early saves
**Anti-Crystal Items**: Blessed wooden items grant +2 bonus to saves ### Early Treatment (Stages 1-2)

**Dispel Magic**: Cast at 3rd level or higher to halt progression temporarily
**Lesser Restoration**: Can reverse Stage 1 if cast within 24 hours
**Heat Treatment**: Extended exposure to high temperatures breaks down crystal growth
**Nature Magic**: Druid spells can encourage organic tissue regeneration ### Intermediate Treatment (Stages 2-3)

**Greater Restoration**: Requires caster of 7th level or higher
**Chaos Infusion**: Controlled exposure to chaotic magic to disrupt crystal patterns
**Surgical Removal**: Physical excision of crystal growths (risky but effective)
**Memory Restoration**: Therapy to recover suppressed emotional responses ### Advanced Treatment (Stages 3-4)

**Wish Spell**: Direct reality alteration to reverse transformation
**Divine Intervention**: Major deity directly reverses crystallization
**Time Magic**: Temporal restoration to pre-infection state
**Soul Transfer**: Move consciousness to new uncorrupted body ### Experimental Treatments

**Controlled Corruption**: Use beneficial crystals to fight malevolent ones
**Harmonic Disruption**: Sonic weapons to shatter crystal structures
**Reality Anchor Therapy**: Stabilize patient in non-crystal reality state
**Collective Consciousness Severance**: Magical isolation from Crystal Network ### Story Hooks

**The Beautiful Curse**: NPCs willingly seek crystal corruption for its benefits
**Crystal Cult**: Organization promotes crystallization as evolutionary advancement
**Network Infiltration**: Crystal Network attempts to subvert government or organizations
**The Pure One**: Single individual shows complete immunity to crystal corruption ### Environmental Effects

**Crystal Gardens**: Areas where corruption has created stunning but dangerous landscapes
**Network Nodes**: Locations where Crystal Network consciousness is strongest
**Reality Stabilization**: Crystallized areas resist chaos magic and dimensional breaches
**Harmonic Fields**: Crystal resoce creates areas of enhanced or suppressed magic ### Social Implications

**Crystal Caste System**: Society develops hierarchy based on corruption levels
**Enhancement Debates**: Political conflict over voluntary crystallization
**Economic Disruption**: Crystal beings don't need traditional goods and services
**Identity Crisis**: Families struggle with partially transformed relatives ## Research Notes

*Crystal corruption appears to be both disease and evolution, transforming organic life into living mathematical constructs. The Crystal Network demonstrates emergent intelligence that may represent a new form of consciousness.* *Subjects report enhanced cognitive abilities but loss of emotional depth. The transformation may represent an attempt by crystal entities to create hybrid intelligences capable of bridging mathematical and organic thought.* *Latest studies suggest the corruption serves a larger purpose related to reality stabilization, possibly as defense against chaos magic or dimensional threats.* --- **Medical Advisory**: Crystal corruption is seductive because it provides real benefits. Patients often resist treatment voluntarily. Early intervention is critical for successful reversal. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*
