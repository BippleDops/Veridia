# Hex
*1st-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (the petrified eye of a newt)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You place a curse on a creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra `d6` Necrotic damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack roll. Also, choose one ability when you cast the spell. The target has [[Advantage Xphb]] on ability checks made with the chosen ability.

If the target drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] before this spell ends, you can take a [[Action Xphb]] on a later turn to curse a new creature.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Your [[conditions#Concentration|Concentration]] can last longer with a spell slot of level 2 (up to 4 hours), 3-4 (up to 8 hours), or 5+ (24 hours).

**Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
