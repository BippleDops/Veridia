# Fang Fist (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: V, S


## Effects
One of your arms, from the elbow down, turns into a snake that can attack by your command or independently of you. It uses your spell attack modifier to attack, has a reach of 15 feet, has an AC of 16, and will turn back into a normal arm if it is dealt more than 12 points of damage in a single round (you take all damage inflicted on the arm). On a successful hit, it inflicts 1d8 + your Strength modifier in piercing damage, and the target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 2d6 poison damage on a failed saving throw or half as much on a successful one.

The snake can also be used as a clumsy arm; it is capable of grasping objects firmly, although it cannot manipulate them.
