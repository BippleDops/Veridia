# Protection from Evil and Good
*1st-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a flask of Holy Water worth 25+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against creatures that are Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have [[Advantage Xphb]] on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be possessed by or gain the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] or [[conditions#frightened|Frightened]] conditions from them. If the target is already possessed, [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]], or [[conditions#frightened|Frightened]] by such a creature, the target has [[Advantage Xphb]] on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
