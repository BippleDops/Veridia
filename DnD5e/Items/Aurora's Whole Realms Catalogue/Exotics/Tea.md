## Description
In my travels to the outlying parts of Shou Lung, I had the pleasurable opportunity to become familiar with refined practice of tea drinking. Similar in concept to our herbal infusions, the Shou have raised tea drinking to a fine art. Through special arrangement, I am now able to offer a variety of Shou teas, invigorating and yet soothing at the same time. Pale Jade is our most popular variety, subtle in flavor and color, while for those who prefer a stronger taste, Earth Dragon’s Eye will satisfy. (Pale Jade: 20 gp/lb.; Earth Dragon’s Eye 50 gp/lb.)
