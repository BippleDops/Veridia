# Cloak of the Bat

## Overview

**Group**: *Wondrous item*

**Rarity**: *rare*

**Attunement**: *requires attunement*


## Description
While wearing this cloak, you have [[2 - Advantage and Disadvantage|advantage]] on [[Dexterity|Dexterity]] ([[Dexterity|Stealth]]) checks. In an area of [[9 - The Environment|dim light]] or [[9 - The Environment|darkness]], you can grip the edges of the cloak with both hands and use it to [[13 - Movement and Position|fly]] at a speed of 40 feet. If you ever fail to grip the cloak’s edges while [[13 - Movement and Position|flying]] in this way, or if you are no longer in dim light or darkness, you lose this flying speed.

While wearing the cloak in an area of [[9 - The Environment|dim light]] or [[9 - The Environment|darkness]], you can use your action to cast **[[Polymorph|polymorph]]** on yourself, transforming into a [[Bat|bat]]. While you are in the form of the bat, you retain your [[Intelligence|Intelligence]], [[Wisdom|Wisdom]], and [[Charisma|Charisma]] scores. The cloak can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.
