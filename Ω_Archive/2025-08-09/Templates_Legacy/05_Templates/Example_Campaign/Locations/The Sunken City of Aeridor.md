# The Sunken City of Aeridor

## General Info
**Location**: [[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/Locations/The Contested Waters]]

Aeridor was once a beautiful and prosperous city, but it was swallowed by the sea in a great cataclysm centuries ago. Now, it is a sunken ruin, haunted by the ghosts of its past and guarded by fearsome sea creatures.

## GM Notes
- The city is home to a powerful magical artifact, the Heart of the Sea.
- The artifact is sought by many, including the Zhentarim and the Kraken Society.
- The party will have to brave the dangers of the deep and overcome many challenges to reach the city and claim the artifact.
