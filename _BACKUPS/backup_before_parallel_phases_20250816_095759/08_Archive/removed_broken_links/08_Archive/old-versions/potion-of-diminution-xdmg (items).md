*Potion, rare* - **Weight**: 0.5 lbs. When you drink this potion, you gain the "reduce" effect of the [[Enlarge Reduce Xphb spell for`d4`hours (no [conditions#Concentration|Concentration]] required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 287.
