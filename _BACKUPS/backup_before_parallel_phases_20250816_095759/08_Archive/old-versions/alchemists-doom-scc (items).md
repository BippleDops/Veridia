*Adventuring gear* - **Weight**: 1.0 lbs. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's doom as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 7 (``dice: 2d6``) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a **DC 10** Dexterity check to extinguish the flames. *Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 179* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Alchemists doom scc is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
