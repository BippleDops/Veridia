# Compelled Duel
*1st-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You try to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has [Disadvantage](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and it can't willingly move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you.

The spell ends if you make an attack roll against a creature other than the target, if you cast a spell on an enemy other than the target, if an ally of yours damages the target, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.

**Classes**: [Paladin](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md)
