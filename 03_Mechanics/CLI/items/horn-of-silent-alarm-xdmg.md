# Horn of Silent Alarm
*Wondrous item, common*  



This horn has 4 charges and regains `d4` expended charges daily at dawn. As a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action, you can blow the horn while expending 1 charge. One creature of your choice hears the horn's blare, provided that creature is within 600 feet of the horn. No other creature hears the horn.
