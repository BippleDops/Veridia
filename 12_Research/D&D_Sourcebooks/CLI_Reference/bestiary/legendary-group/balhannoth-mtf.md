# Balhannoth

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_

When fighting inside its lair, a balhannoth can use lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), a balhannoth can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; the balhannoth can't use the same lair action two rounds in a row:

- The balhannoth warps reality around it in an area up to 500 feet square. After 10 minutes, the terrain in the area reshapes to assume the appearance of a location sought by one intelligent creature whose mind the balhannoth has read (see Regional Effects below). The transformation affects nonliving material only and can't create anything with moving parts or magical properties. Any object created in this area is, upon close inspection, revealed as a fake. Books are filled with empty pages, golden items are obvious counterfeits, and so on. The transformation lasts until the balhannoth dies or uses this lair action again.  
- The balhannoth targets one creature within 500 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or the target, along with whatever it is wearing and carrying, teleports to an unoccupied space of the balhannoth's choice within 60 feet of it.  
- The balhannoth targets one creature within 500 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or the balhannoth becomes [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Invisible|invisible]] to that creature for 1 minute. This effect ends if the balhannoth attacks the target.  

## Regional effects

A region containing a balhannoth's lair becomes warped by the creature's unnatural presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- Creatures within 1 mile of the balhannoth's lair experience a sensation of being close to whatever they desire most. The sensation grows stronger the closer the creatures come to the balhannoth's lair.  
- The balhannoth can sense the strongest desires of any humanoid within 1 mile of it and learns whether those desires involve a place: a safe location to rest, a temple, home, or somewhere else.  

If the balhannoth dies, these effects end immediately.
