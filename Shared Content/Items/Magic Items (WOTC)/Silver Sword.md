# Silver Sword

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Melee Weapon, Martial Weapon, Shortsword

**Rarity:** unknown (magic)

**Attunement**: *requires attunement* by a creature that has psionic ability

**Weight**: 6 lbs.

**Damage:** 2d6 slashing

## Description

You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. On a critical hit against a target in an astral body (as with the [[astral projection]]  spell), you can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.

**Heavy.** Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

**Two-Handed.** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
