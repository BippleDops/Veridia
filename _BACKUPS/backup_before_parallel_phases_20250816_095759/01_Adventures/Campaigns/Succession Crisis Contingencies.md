--- # Succession Crisis Contingencies

*The Fractured Crown and the Drowning Dynasty* > *"When the Emperor scattered himself, he scattered the throne with him. Now we have seventeen ways to claim a crown that exists in seven pieces."*

> — Succession Scholar Thalassa Crownkeeper ### The Scattered Emperor Problem

The current ruler, known as the Scattered Emperor, exists as seven distinct personality fragments across different locations. This unprecedented situation has created:
- **Legal Paradox:** Which fragment has legitimate authority?
- **Practical Crisis:** Multiple contradictory royal decrees issued simultaneously
- **Succession Chaos:** No clear mechanism for transition of power
- **Identity Crisis:** Who inherits from a ruler who isn't technically dead? ### The Seven Imperial Fragments

1. **The Crown Fragment (Throne Room):** Handles ceremonial duties, mostly catatonic
2. Additionally, **The Sword Fragment (War Room):** Military decisions, increasingly aggressive
3. **The Scales Fragment (Treasury):** Economic policy, obsessed with accounting
4. **The Orb Fragment (Diplomatic Quarter):** Foreign relations, speaks in riddles 5. **The Scepter Fragment (Parliament):** Legislative oversight, debates itself
6. **The Seal Fragment (Justice Chamber):** Legal matters, judges everything
7. **The Heart Fragment (Location Unknown):** Emotional decisions, whereabouts classified #### The Fragment Paradox

Each imperial fragment claims different succession rights:
- **Crown Fragment:** Says succession requires imperial reunion first
- **Sword Fragment:** Declares martial law, military succession
- **Scales Fragment:** Claims ficial insolvency voids succession
- **Orb Fragment:** Argues diplomatic marriages change inheritance
- **Scepter Fragment:** Insists Parliament must choose successor
- **Seal Fragment:** States all claims are legally invalid until court ruling
- **Heart Fragment:** Unknown position (presumed emotional chaos) #### Competing Legal Interpretations **The Continuity Doctrine**

- Emperor technically never died, so no succession occurs
- Fragments maintain collective authority indefinitely
- Government continues in current fractured state **The Dissolution Theory**
- Scattering constituted legal death/abdication
- Throne is vacant, normal succession applies
- Competing claims must be resolved through traditional means **The Democratic Transition**
- Imperial fracture invalidates monarchy entirely
- Parliament assumes permanent authority
- Republic established by constitutional convention **The Regency Solution**
- Appoint regent until Emperor can be reconstituted
- Maintain fictional imperial authority
- Avoid succession crisis through temporary measures ### Scenario Alpha: Constitutional Convention
