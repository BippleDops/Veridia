## Description
This unusual wine indigenous to the North is a purplish-blue hue, often leading to jokes that the grapes that go into making it “caught a chill.” This is quite true, as the grapes are allowed to freeze on the vine. They are then harvested and crushed while still frozen. Winter wine is very strong and sweet, and is usually served in small quantities as a dessert. The Chessentan berries that give it the blue tinge also lend it a unique spicy tone. Hand keg, 7 sp; cask, 33 sp; barrel, 8 gp; butt, 26 gp; tun, 65 gp.
