## Troll

*Loathsome, Regenerating Lurker*

- **Habitat.** Arctic, Forest, Hill, Mountain, Swamp, Underdark  
- **Treasure.** None  

Trolls creep forth to prey on smaller creatures and drag captives back to festering lairs. These misshapen brutes can regenerate from wounds and regrow severed body parts—including their heads. A troll's severed limbs continue to move and attack. Unless they're burned by flames or acid, trolls can recover from egregious wounds and seek revenge on those who felled them.

Trolls typically hunt alone, but small groups occasionally cooperate to ambush prey or raid villages. Creatures such as hags and hill giants might convince trolls to work for them in exchange for disgusting meals.

## Environment

arctic, forest, hill, mountain, swamp, underdark

## Player-Facing Summary

Troll xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of troll xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around troll xmm.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
