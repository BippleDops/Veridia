Now is your chance for vengeance! Your hit list consists of three names: a human cultist named [Frulam Mondath](/compendium/bestiary/npc/frulam-mondath-hotdq.md), a half-orc named Bog Luck, and a half-dragon named [Rezmir](/compendium/bestiary/npc/rezmir-hotdq.md).

| There is no greater duty than to serve the Revered Queen. |
| I lost someone important to an agent of the Dwendalian Empire. That regime will fall. |

| I'm utterly loyal to my superior in the guild, more than to the guild or its guildmaster. |
| My honor is my life. |
| I hope one day to write the laws, not just enforce them. |
| I feel indebted to [Mister Witch](/compendium/bestiary/npc/mister-witch-wbtw.md) and [Mister Light](/compendium/bestiary/npc/mister-light-wbtw.md) for giving me a home and a purpose. |

| Years ago, a vicious noble named [Ghazrim DuLoc](/compendium/bestiary/npc/ghazrim-duloc-oota.md) was implicated in the death of someone you cared about. The crime was covered up, though, and DuLoc disappeared. Rumor has it the Zhentarim aided his escape, but you've sworn to find him one day. |
| The first people to be hurt by this war will be the common folk. I need to protect them. |
| You have a secret. You once were a gold dragon who served Bahamut. You were too proud and vain, to the point that Bahamut decided to teach you a lesson. You have been trapped in a weak, humanoid body, with your memories of your former life but a dim shadow. You remember only one thing with perfect clarity: Bahamut's command to go into the world and prove your devotion to the cause of good. If you prove worthy, on your death you will return to his side in your true form. |
| I will bring terrible wrath down on the evildoers who destroyed my homeland. |
| I hate a certain mortal family and steal one of their children each generation for my own purposes. |
| I had a dear mentor from another nation who taught me my skills. |
| One person in particular owes me a lot of money, and I need to keep them alive if I want to be repaid. |
| There's always a road I haven't traveled before. I'm always looking for new places to explore. |
| I want to be a warlord someday, and I won't stop there. |
| I've been searching my whole life for the answer to a certain question. |
| Leosin Erlanthar, a wandering monk, once saved your life. He's sent urgent word for you to meet him in a small town called Greenest. Looks like it's time to pay off that debt. |

| I am beholden to an Azorius arrester who captured the criminal who killed my parents, saving me from the same fate. |
| Every five nights, you have a strange sequence of apocalyptic dreams. The world is destroyed by cold, choking fumes, lightning storms, waves of acid, and horrible fire. Each time, the dream ends with ten evil eyes glaring at you from the darkness. You feel a strange compulsion to travel to Greenest. Perhaps the answer to the riddle of your dreams awaits you there. |
| I spend as much time as I can in the Ismeri Library because I'm certain an information hub operates behind its facade. I want its secrets! |
| I consider every member of my parent's former adventuring party to be family. |
| I strive to live up to a specific hero's example. |
| Even away from Keld, my loyalty is to my warlord and the rest of my warhost. |
| Yeenoghu's omens guide my every choice. |
| I sold my soul for knowledge. I hope to do great deeds and win it back. |
| The dragon's presence in the hills destroyed valuable territory and resulted in deaths within my tribe. The creature must pay for what it has done. |

| Fear leads to tyranny, and both must be eradicated. |
| If I die in battle, I was simply too weak to please Yeenoghu. |
| The unbearable weight of my debt has driven me to desperation. |
| The dragons destroyed everything you hold dear. They killed your family and destroyed your home. Now, with nothing but what you carry on your back and a horrid scar of the near fatal wounds you sustained in the attack, you seek revenge. |
| Out for revenge |
| Kobolds have caused you and your people nothing but trouble. You will avenge those wrongs. |
