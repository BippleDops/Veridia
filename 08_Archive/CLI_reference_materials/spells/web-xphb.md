# Web
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You conjure a mass of sticky webbing at a point within range. The webs fill a 20-foot [Cube](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) there for the duration. The webs are [Difficult Terrain](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md), and the area within them is [Lightly Obscured](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/lightly-obscured-xphb.md).

If the webs aren't anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

The first time a creature enters the webs on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [Restrained](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Restrained) condition while in the webs or until it breaks free.

A creature [Restrained](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Restrained) by the webs can take an action to make a Strength ([Athletics](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Athletics)) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer [Restrained](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Restrained).

The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot [Cube](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing `2d4` Fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.

**Classes**: [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Druid (Circle of the Land)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-circle-of-the-land-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard (College of Lore)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)

## Player-Facing Summary

Web xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of web xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around web xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties web xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at web xphb to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to web xphb active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
