--- # Alter Self

*2nd-level, Transmutation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour You alter your physical form. Choose one of the following options. Its effects last for the duration, during which you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic action to replace the option you chose with a different one. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Aquatic Adaptation You sprout gills and grow webs between your fingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a [swim-speed-xphb (variant-rules)]] equal to your [[Fly Speed Xphb. ## Change Appearance You alter your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species, though none of your statistics change. You can't appear as a creature of a different size, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. For the duration, you can take a [actions#Magic|Magic]] action to change your appearance in this way again. ## Natural Weapons You grow claws (Slashing), fangs (Piercing), horns (Piercing), or hooves (Bludgeoning). When you use your [[Unarmed Strike Xphb to deal damage with that new growth, it deals`d6`damage of the type in parentheses instead of dealing the normal damage for your [Unarmed Strike Xphb]], and you use your spellcasting ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls rather than using Strength. ## Summary **Classes**: [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 239. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* ## Player-Facing Summary Alter self xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of alter self xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around alter self xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [Master_Spell_Compendium]]
