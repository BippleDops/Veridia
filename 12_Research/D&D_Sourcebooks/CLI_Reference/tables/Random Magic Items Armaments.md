## Lore Details

Legends speak of random magic items armaments as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around random magic items armaments.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties random magic items armaments to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at random magic items armaments to avert a public scandal.
