# Synchronized Festival Across Worlds

Music and lanterns echo across the gate. Two parades mirror each other, step for step.

What you notice
- Familiar songs with new words
- Children waving from both sides

What you can try
- Keep the route clear
- Share in the moment without losing focus

Possible outcomes
- The celebration lifts everyone
- A scuffle starts at the edge
- A dream from one world spills into the other
