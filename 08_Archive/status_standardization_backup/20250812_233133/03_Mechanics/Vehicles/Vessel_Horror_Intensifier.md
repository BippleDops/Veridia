# Vessel Horror Intensifier

Turn ships into characters and haunted spaces. Hooks deeply into [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]], [[Deep Mother]], and living ship rules.

## Confined-Space Horror
- Isolation Clocks: Track hours without external contact; escalate checks
- Tight Bulkheads: Movement penalties, echoing footsteps, claustrophobia saves
- Lighting Economy: Darkness creates false sensor echoes; fear triggers

## Parasite & Infestation Playbooks
- Hull Worms: Eat through segments; crew hunt mini-dungeon
- Choir Mold: Singing fungus; lures crew to vents
- Mind Barnacles: Attach to helmsman; steer off course

## Ghosts & Curses
- Memory Ghosts: Former crews replay final hours; can be bargained with
- Cursed Hulls: Ship remembers injustice; demands atonement quests

## Living Ship Psychology
- Hungers: Memories, storms, songs, sacrifices
- Attachment: Picks favorite crew; jealousy events
- Nightmares: Ship dreams leak into corridors; shared visions

## Mechanics
- Horror Scenes grant XP to ship and crew; but drain Sanity Pool (see [[Vehicle_Core_Rules#6) Ship Sanity & Madness (Living/Conscious Vessels)|Ship Sanity]])
- Exorcism/Communion: Anchor rites vs. Deep Mother bargains
