# Empowered Spell
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 142. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span>*  

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one), and you must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you've already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.
