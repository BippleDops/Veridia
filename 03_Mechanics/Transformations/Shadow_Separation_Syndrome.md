# Shadow Separation Syndrome
## Consciousness Splitting Mechanics

### Overview

Shadow Conspiracy surgical techniques can separate a person's shadow from their body, creating an independent entity while leaving the original diminished. This horrific transformation serves the conspiracy's infiltration goals.

### Separation Process

#### Stage 1: Surgical Preparation
**Duration:** 2-4 hours
**Requirements:** Shadow surgeon, memory crystals, consciousness dampening
**Process:** Patient kept conscious during shadow extraction
**Survival Rate:** 85% for willing subjects, 60% for unwilling

#### Stage 2: Shadow Animation
**Duration:** 24 hours of stabilization
**Process:** Separated shadow gains independent consciousness
**Memory Transfer:** Shadow retains most original memories
**Personality Copy:** Shadow mirrors original but with altered loyalties

#### Stage 3: Original Conditioning
**Duration:** 1 week of psychological manipulation
**Process:** Original person's memory gaps filled with false information
**Goal:** Make original believe shadow never existed
**Success Rate:** 70% complete conditioning, 20% partial, 10% failure

### Mechanical Effects

#### Original Person (Post-Separation)
**Ability Score Changes:**
- Wisdom reduced by 4 (shadow contained intuition)
- Charisma reduced by 2 (diminished presence)
- Intelligence unchanged (knowledge intact)

**New Limitations:**
- Cannot cast spells requiring Wisdom 13+
- Disadvantage on Insight and Perception checks
- Vulnerable to charm and fear effects
- Memory gaps regarding personal history

**Compensation Effects:**
- Advantage on saves vs. shadow magic
- Cannot be tracked by magical means
- Immune to mind reading (thoughts incomplete)
- Reduced sleep requirements

#### Shadow Person (Independent Entity)
**Ability Scores:** Match original at time of separation
**Special Abilities:**
- Incorporeal movement through shadows
- Perfect disguise as original person
- Memory access to original's experiences
- Immunity to non-magical physical damage

**Limitations:**
- Vulnerable to radiant damage (double)
- Cannot enter consecrated ground
- Weakened in bright light (disadvantage)
- Tethered to original (max 1 mile distance)

### Detection Methods

#### Visual Identification
**Shadow Examination:**
- Original person casts no shadow in direct light
- Reflection appears "flat" or two-dimensional
- Eyes lack certain depths or warmth
- Subtle personality differences

**Magical Detection:**
- *Detect Magic* reveals necromancy aura
- *True Seeing* shows missing shadow
- *Zone of Truth* has unusual effects (half-truth responses)
- Divine magic feels "muffled" around affected person

#### Behavioral Signs
**Personality Changes:**
- Slightly different mannerisms or speech patterns
- Memory inconsistencies about personal details
- Reduced emotional responses
- Increased compliance with authority
- Difficulty with creative or intuitive tasks

### Shadow Behavior

### Reversal & Reunification

#### Magical Reunification
**Requirements:**

**Process:**
1. Original and shadow stand in magical circle
2. Shadow must voluntarily merge with original
3. Spellcaster channels reunification energy
4. Both entities experience temporary unconsciousness
5. Single person emerges with combined memories

#### Complications During Reunification
**Memory Conflicts:** Contradictory experiences create confusion
