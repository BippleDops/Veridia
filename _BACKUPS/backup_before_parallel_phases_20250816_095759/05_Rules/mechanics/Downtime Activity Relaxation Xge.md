--- # Downtime Activity: Relaxation

*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 131* Sometimes the best thing to do between adventures is relax. Whether a character wants a hard-earned vacation or needs to recover from injuries, relaxation is the ideal option for adventurers who need a break. This option is also ideal for players who don't want to make use of the downtime system. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Resources Relaxation requires one week. A character needs to maintain at least a modest lifestyle while relaxing to gain the benefit of the activity. ## Resolution Characters who maintain at least a modest lifestyle while relaxing gain several benefits. While relaxing, a character gains advantage on saving throws to recover from long-acting diseases and poisons. In addition, at the end of the week, a character can end one effect that keeps the character from regaining hit points, or can restore one ability score that has been reduced to less than its normal value. This benefit cannot be used if the harmful effect was caused by a spell or some other magical effect with an ongoing duration. ## Complications Relaxation rarely comes with complications. If you want to make life complicated for the characters, introduce an action or an event connected to a rival. ## Player-Facing Summary Downtime activity relaxation xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
