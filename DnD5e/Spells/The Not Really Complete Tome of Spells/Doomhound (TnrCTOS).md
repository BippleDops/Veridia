# Doomhound (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *illusion*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Until dispelled


## Effects
You create a shadowy mastiff with glowing eyes, visible and audible only to you and the target of the spell. Upon first seeing the hound, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at disadvantage. On a success, the hound disappears. On a failure, the creature is frightened for 10 minutes.

Thereafter, the target is relentless stalked by the hound. It never comes closer than 10 feet or farther than 300 feet from the target, but it fills the target with an unshakable premonition of death. While haunted by the hound, the target is at disadvantage on all saving throws to avoid being frightened. The hound, despite its fear-inspiring appearance, cannot attack and cannot be attacked.

This curse can be broken by casting a *re-move curse* or *wish* spell, if the target rolls natural twenties on both dice when saving against being frightened, or if you use your action to dismiss the spell.
