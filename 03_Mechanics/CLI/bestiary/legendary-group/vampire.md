# Vampire

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual_

The region surrounding a vampire's lair is warped by the creature's unnatural presence, creating any of the following effects:

- There's a noticeable increase in the populations of bats, rats, and wolves in the region.  
- Plants within 500 feet of the lair wither, and their stems and branches become twisted and thorny.  
- Shadows cast within 500 feet of the lair seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move as though alive.  
- A creeping fog clings to the ground within 500 feet of the vampire's lair. The fog occasionally takes eerie forms, such as grasping claws and writhing serpents.  

If the vampire is destroyed, these effects end after `2d6` days.
