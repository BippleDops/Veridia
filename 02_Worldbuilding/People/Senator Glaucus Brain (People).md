# 🧠 Senator Glaucus
> *Senior Senator of the Parliament of Echoes*

### Physical Description
An elderly statesman whose body shows decades of depth adaptation - slightly translucent skin with a pearl-like sheen, eyes that shift between blue and black depending on the light. His shadow often moves a fraction of a second before he does, a disturbing sign of its growing independence.

**Distinguishing Features**:
- Webbed fingers (subtle, usually hidden by gloves)
- Shadow that sometimes faces different directions
- Voice carries underwater echo even in air

### Personality Traits
**Primary**: Desperately maintaining composure while terrified
**Secondary**: Genuinely cares about constituent safety
**Under Pressure**: Becomes overly formal and procedural as defense mechanism

### 🔺 Core Drive (Why they exist)
**Ultimate Goal**: Preserve the Parliament's authority while preventing his own dissolution into shadow

### 🔷 Needs (What they require)

2. **Security**: Parliament must remain stable and in control
3. **Social**: Maintain reputation as competent leader despite shadow issues

### 💎 Wants (What they desire)
1. **Short-term**: Find cure for his shadow independence before others notice
2. **Medium-term**: Pass legislation to control shadow liberation movement
3. **Long-term**: Retire with dignity before transformation completes

### 😨 Fears (What they avoid)
1. **Immediate Fear**: His shadow acting independently in public
2. **Deep Fear**: Complete dissolution like Senator Marius
3. **Secret Fear**: He's already lost control and doesn't know it

### 🔐 Secrets (What they hide)
1. **Public Secret**: His shadow moves independently (many have noticed)
2. **Private Secret**: He's been negotiating secretly with shadow entities
3. **Dark Secret**: He witnessed the first shadow liberation experiment 20 years ago and said nothing
