--- # Stat Block

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 374. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* A stat block contains the game statistics of a [[Charm Monster Xphb]]. Each stat block includes the following information presented after the [[Charm Monster Xphb]] name. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Size A [[Charm Monster Xphb]] is Tiny, Small, Med ium, Large, Huge, or Gargantuan. ## Creature Type This entry notes the family of beings a [[Charm Monster Xphb]] belongs to, along with any descriptive tags. ## Alignment An alignment is suggested for the [[Charm Monster Xphb]], with the DM determining its actual alignment. ## AC, Initiative, and HP These entries give the [[Charm Monster Xphb]] [[armor-class-xphb (variant-rules)]], [[Initiative Xphb]], and [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]], which are detailed in "chapter 1". In parentheses after the [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]], the [[Charm Monster Xphb]] [[hit-point-dice-xphb (variant-rules)]] are provided, along with the contribution of its Constitution, if any, to its [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]]. Following the [[Initiative Xphb]] modifier is an [[Initiative Xphb]] score. Some creatures that are created by magic lack Hit Dice and [[Initiative Xphb]] information. ## Speed Here the [[Charm Monster Xphb]] Speed is provided, along with any special speeds. ## Ability Scores A table provides the [[Charm Monster Xphb]] ability scores, modifiers, and [[Death Saving Throw Xphb]] modifiers, all of which are detailed in "chapter 1". ## Skills This entry lists the [[Charm Monster Xphb]] skill proficiencies, if any. ## Resistances and Vulnerabilities These entries list the [[Charm Monster Xphb]] Resistances and Vulnerabilities, if any. ## Immunities This section lists the [[Charm Monster Xphb]] damage and [[condition-xphb (variant-rules)]] Immunities, if any. ## Gear If the [[Charm Monster Xphb]] has any equipment that can be given away or retrieved, it's listed in this entry. ## Senses This entry lists the [[Charm Monster Xphb]] special senses, such as [[senses#Darkvision|Darkvision]], and its Passive [[skills#Perception|Perception]]. ## Languages This entry lists any languages the [[Charm Monster Xphb]] knows. ## CR Challenge Rating summarizes the threat a [[Charm Monster Xphb]] poses and is detailed in the "Monster Manual". The Experience Points characters receive for defeating a [[Charm Monster Xphb]] and its [[Proficiency Xphb]] follow. Some creatures that are created by magic have no CR. ## Traits The [[Charm Monster Xphb]] traits, if any, are features that are active at all times or in certain situations. ## Actions The [[Charm Monster Xphb]] can take these actions in addition to those detailed in this glossary. ## Bonus Actions If the [[Charm Monster Xphb]] has [[Action Xphb]] options, they are listed in this section. ## Reactions If the [[Charm Monster Xphb]] can take special [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules)]], those are listed in this section. ## Attack Notation The entry for a [[Charm Monster Xphb]] attack starts by identifying whether the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and then provides the attack roll's bonus, its reach or range, and what happens on a hit. An attack is against one target unless its entry says otherwise. ## Saving Throw Effect Notation If an effect forces a [[Death Saving Throw Xphb]], the effect's entry starts by identifying the kind of [[Death Saving Throw Xphb]] required and then provides the save's DC, a description of which creatures must make the save, and what happens on a failed or a successful save. ## Damage Notation A stat block usually provides both a static number and a die expression for each instance of damage. For example, an attack might deal 4 (`1d4 + 2`) damage on a hit. The DM determines whether you use the static number or the die expression in parentheses; you don't use both. ## Player-Facing Summary Stat block xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of stat block xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around stat block xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A document has gone missing and evil awakens
