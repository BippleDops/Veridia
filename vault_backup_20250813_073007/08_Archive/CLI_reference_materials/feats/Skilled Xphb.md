# Skilled
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 201. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

You gain proficiency in any combination of three [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/tables/skill-list-skills-xphb|skills]] or tools of your choice.

**Repeatable.** You can take this feat more than once.

## Player-Facing Summary

Skilled xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of skilled xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around skilled xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties skilled xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at skilled xphb to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to skilled xphb active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
