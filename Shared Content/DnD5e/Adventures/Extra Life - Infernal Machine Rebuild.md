This adventure is designed for five characters of 5th to 10th level.

> ##### A Note from the D&d Team
>Starting in 2017, the D&D team has added several projects to the DMs Guild in support of Extra Life (including *One Grung Above*, *The Lost Kenku*, *The Tortle Package*, and last year's *Lost Laboratory of Kwalish*). Funds raised from their sale went to this extremely worthy cause—and for 2019, you'll find even more projects made available on the DMs Guild throughout the year.
>
>As part of these efforts, it's our privilege to contribute the following adventure to the cause. We hope you enjoy *Infernal Machine Rebuild*. And you have our sincere thanks for your support of Extra Life and Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.

## Background
Eons ago, a planar craft of unknown origin crashed within the Barrier Peaks. The scholar Kwalish would later find this craft, converting it into his laboratory and studying its technology to fuel his own experiments. However, Kwalish was not the first explorer to do so.

Earlier expeditions also chanced upon the crash site, and although most parties perished while delving through the craft, a few managed to recover rare objects never conceived by even the greatest minds of this world. Many of these objects were subsequently lost over time—and most resulted in the deaths of their owners along the way. But a few persisted, controlled by those able to glean some partial understanding of their operation.

Among the most important of these relics was the planar craft's central command console, used to guide its flight through space and time. Legend of this object grew as it fell into the hands of a warlord and came to be known as a most powerful artifact: the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad* (so named after its last owner). Yet with the defeat of Baron Lum, his *Infernal Machine* was said to have been destroyed as well.

Currently, the archdevils Zariel and Bel both have designs on rebuilding Lum's infernal machine. Zariel is the present master of Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. Bel is the deposed former master of that layer. But to rebuild the infernal machine, both devils require a number of missing components—former control buttons vital to the machine's operation. Zariel and Bel have both planted agents in the world, tasking those agents with finding adventurers to track down and claim these components. Once the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad* is complete, whichever devil controls it plans to use the machine to claim final dominion over Avernus.

## Adventure Summary
While journeying through fey woods, the characters must choose whether to help a trio of (supposed) dryads or a unicorn, with each faction blaming the other for the woods' corruption. Either way, the characters come across a fallen clock tower containing a strange set of magical components, which appear to manipulate time within a localized area.

Discovery of these components leads to an invitation to meet one of two agents: **Lynx Creatlach** or **Sir Ursas**. Both are in competition with each another to collect all such missing components, in order to reassemble the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad*. Each agent pledges to use the *Infernal Machine* against devilish forces plaguing the world—but each secretly plans to give it to their own patron archdevil. Both ask for the characters' help, looking to hire them to undertake expeditions to retrieve the missing components. 

Once the characters are involved, they are provided the resources to travel to two legendary locations of the past to recover the *Infernal Machine* components believed to be there. First is the Tomb of Horrors, in the period while the infamous dungeon is still under construction. There, they meet the tomb's architect, **Moghadam**, who oversees the site with an iron hand. The second location is the Temple of Moloch in the same era. The temple is run by **Moghadam**'s chief rival, **Thessalar**—the inventor of the thessalhydra and many other grotesque monsters, including the owlbear.

The characters must navigate the perils of both locations, manipulate time, and manage untrustworthy agents to return with as many of the missing components as they can. And even then, they must contend with the agents who hired them, and ensure that a completed *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad* does not fall into the wrong hands!

> ##### Who's Who
>This adventure explores two locations of the distant past, and as such, features artifacts and figures from the deepest history of D&D.
>
>The demilich Acererak and his tomb are familiar from 1978's original Tomb of Horrors and 2017's Tomb of Annihilation. But this adventure also features **Tarnhem**, Acererak's balor father, and **Moghadam**, the tomb's architect, both of whom first appeared in the era of 1998's Return to the Tomb of Horrors.
>
>The Temple of Moloch derives from the sample dungeon map appearing in the first edition Dungeon Masters Guide of 1979, and includes the famed statue of Moloch featured on the cover of the first edition Players Handbook from 1978. This version of the dungeon features **Thessalar**, a figure rumored to have created many of the game's strange monsters—including the thessalhydra, which appeared in the first edition AD&D Monster Manual II and 2019's Stranger Things Starter Set.
>
>As for the centerpiece of the adventure, the artifact known as the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad first appeared as the Machine of Lum the Mad back in 1976, in original D&D's Supplement III: Eldritch Wizardry. But of course, you are free to modify or swap out any of these elements of D&D canon with artifacts and NPCs more relevant to more recent official storylines, or for better resonance with your own home campaign.
>

## Running the Adventure
To run this adventure, you need the D&D fifth edition core rulebooks—the *Player's Handbook*, the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, and the *Monster Manual*.

Most of the monsters that appear in the adventure are from the *Monster Manual*, along with a number of creatures from other books (including *Volo's Guide to Monsters* and *Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes*) plus a number of new creatures and NPCs. For easy reference, all the stat blocks for the creatures in the adventure can be found in appendix B. When a creature's name appears in bold type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block in that appendix. Full information on creatures from the *Monster Manual*, *Volo's Guide to Monsters*, and *Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes* can be found in those books.

Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the *Player's Handbook*. Magic items are described in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*. Where new spells and magic items appear in the adventure, the text directs you to their descriptions in appendix C.

>>Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under specific circumstances, as described in the text.

## Adventure Hooks
You can bring the characters into this adventure in any way that makes sense for your campaign. Make use of any of the following suggestions, or use them as inspiration.

### Lost Laboratory of Kwalish
You can make use of this adventure in conjunction with 2018's Extra Life adventure *Lost Laboratory of Kwalish* in one of two ways. If you want to use *Infernal Machine Rebuild* as a prelude to *Lost Laboratory of Kwalish*, the conclusion of this adventure can involve the characters learning that one of the functions of the *Infernal Machine* leads to Kwalish and his hidden laboratory, thought to be within the Barrier Peaks.

As a continuation of *Lost Laboratory of Kwalish*, you can use the legendary inventor as a replacement for this adventure's agents, **Lynx Creatlach** and **Sir Ursas**. Kwalish has long researched legends about the missing components of the *Infernal Machine* scattered across the world. Reaching out to the characters, he tasks them with recovering the missing components, with **Lynx Creatlach** and **Sir Ursas** serving as rivals along the way. Kwalish can then send the characters out to investigate the manor of one or both agents, wanting to know how far along each agent is in their reconstruction of the *Infernal Machine*.

### Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus
If you're playing through or using events from *Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus* in your campaign, you might tie that campaign to this adventure in a number of ways.

To enter Candlekeep in *Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus*, the characters need a book or scroll that isn't already in the library's vast archives. The hags in *chapter 1* of this adventure possess just such a scroll, which the characters hear about as rumors that lead them to the fey woods. Alternatively, once in Candlekeep, Sylvira Savikas or one of the monks might ask the characters to investigate the corruption of the fey woods as a side quest.

The hags of *chapter 1* might also be in contact with Mad Maggie. Instead of working for either agent, the characters could be tasked with collecting the missing components for Mad Maggie's outpost. And if the characters are already in Avernus, **Lynx Creatlach** and **Sir Ursas** might be operating more openly, and could task the characters with collecting the missing components directly for Bel or Zariel.

### Dragon Heist or Dungeon of the Mad Mage
As a continuation of *Waterdeep: Dragon Heist*, Volo or Laeral Silverhand could ask the characters to investigate a corrupted fey wood located in the nearby mountains. Or one of the missing components might be found in the Vault of Dragons, with the various factions of *Waterdeep: Dragon Heist* replacing the agents in this adventure.

You might choose to place chapter 4's Temple of Moloch somewhere in Halaster's dungeon of Undermountain, whether as part of this adventure scenario or as part of a *Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage* campaign.

> ##### Chapter 1: The Unicorn and the Hags
>Traveling through fey woods, the characters find themselves surrounded by dangerous, corrupted trees. "Rescued" by a trio of hags disguised as dryads, the characters might choose to help them rid the woods of a supposedly evil unicorn. Alternatively, they might meet the unicorn—actually a good creature under assault by the hags that needs their help to fight back. Either way, they encounter a fallen clock tower holding mysterious magical components that can alter the flow of time.
>

> ##### Chapter 2: An Invitation Extended
>Two agents, **Lynx Creatlach** and **Sir Ursas**, compete to hire the characters onto an expedition. Both seek additional components to rebuild the fabled artifact, the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad*—and are looking to history to find them. The characters choose which of two legendary locations in the ancient past to use as the starting point for their search for the components.
>

> ##### Chapter 3: Construction of Horrors
>Traveling to the distant past, the characters explore a version of the Tomb of Horrors still under construction. To obtain the missing components, they must contend with the tomb's architect, **Moghadam**, and disrupt the evil ceremony that keeps a powerful balor imprisoned.
>

> ##### Chapter 4: Temple of Moloch
>The characters explore the ancient Temple of Moloch, also known as the laboratory of **Thessalar**, creator of numerous monsters. To obtain the components, they must contend with **Thessalar**, his lizardfolk guards, and the temple's monstrous denizens.
>

> ##### Chapter 5: Final Showdown
>The characters return to the present with any components recovered. The agent who receives the components installs them in their framework for the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad*, while the other agent launches a raid to seize the machine. The characters are forced to determine who retains possession of this powerful artifact.

# Chapter 1: The Unicorn and the Hags
Whichever hook you choose, the adventure begins while the characters are traveling through a remote fey wood. If *Infernal Machine Rebuild* is played in combination with *Lost Laboratory of Kwalish*, this could be part of the thick band of woods surrounding the pass leading into the Barrier Peaks, known to be infused with the power of the Feywild. The High Forest in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, the Svalich Woods in Barovia, or Xen'drik in Eberron also make excellent starting points.

## Background
A large section of a fey-infused woodland has fallen under the control of a coven of green hags. Using dark gardening techniques, the hags have grafted myconids into the trees of the wood, creating dangerous hybrids and a spreading corruption.

Opposing the hags' evil is a female unicorn named Banrion. After years of skirmishes, the hags have driven Banrion to an isolated pinnacle of rock. This pinnacle stands among the ruins of an ancient city that once housed the *Infernal Machine*, until Baron Lum the Mad discovered and claimed it for himself. A fallen clock tower still holds some of the machine's components, which retain enough power to manipulate time.

## Who Dwells Here?
In addition to mundane animals, these woods are populated by numerous fey creatures (including dryads, pixies, sprites, and satyrs). These fey have taken sides in the conflict between the unicorn and the hags, with those corrupted by the hags having gained control over the woods.

## The Three Mothers
The three **green hags** are intent on capturing the unicorn, Banrion, and corrupting the entirety of the woods. Over time, they have taken on characteristics of certain animals. Mother Stag, their leader, has enormous antlers growing from her head, on which she hangs herb pouches, charms, and dozens of lit candles. Mother Skunk has wide, white streaks in her long black hair. Mother Mole can hardly see, and constantly sniffs the air to find her way about.

Whenever they are encountered, the hags disguise themselves with illusions, making them resemble kindly dryads with their featured animal characteristics.

The trio's hag eye is carried by a **redcap** named Olitor, who uses it to spy on their behalf. Olitor is likewise disguised as a small, disheveled satyr.

> ##### Hag Coven
>Three hags form a coven, which results in heightened power. For higher-level characters, run the hags with their coven benefits to make a hard encounter. For lower-level parties, consider removing the coven's Shared Spellcasting. This feature is something the hags gain only after capturing Banrion.
>
>If Banrion joins the fight against the hags, consider providing them a few additional allies to help balance things out. Such allies might include an additional **redcap** alongside Olitor, or a **myconid sovereign** from the hags' garden.
>

## Banrion the Unicorn
As the guardian of the fey woods, the **unicorn** Banrion has grown weary in her losing battle against the hags, and remains effectively confined to the rocky plateau that is her lair. She defends her home forcefully, and assumes that any characters approaching her position are the hags' hired sellswords.

## The Fey Woods
The characters' journey through the fey woods takes them through the following locations. There is no map for this section of the adventure, so you are free to place these locations anywhere and to use any appropriate forest battle maps for combat.

### Dangerous Pathways
As the characters travel deeper into the woods, they find themselves traversing winding pathways that seem to slowly close in from all sides. At the place where the hags' corruption begins to take hold, the plants have become living traps. Read or paraphrase the following to set the scene:

>>Your path through the woods descends along a ridgeline, with the trees crowding together under a dense canopy above. The ground is littered with fallen nuts. Tree trunks are coated in thick patches of fungus, and a musty smell fills the air. Yet despite the rising gloom, vivid sunbeams still shine between the trees.
>>

#### Suspect Fey
At the edge of the corrupt woods, a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check spots a number of corrupt fey (**sprites**, **pixies**, and **satyrs**) watching the characters' progress. If the check is 14 or higher, or if any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 studies the fey after they've been spotted, the fey appear mean and grubby. The fey run off if they are noticed, shouting with barely disguised menace to "enjoy our sunny woods."

### Sinister Sunbeams
At some point, the hags attempt to trap the characters—so that they can then facilitate their rescue. To do so, they cause the sunbeams shining through the trees to subtly shift around the characters. A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Perception) check notices that the sunbeams are moving in an unnatural way.

#### Hazards and Hindrances
The sunbeams act as tripwires, which can trigger a number of possible hazards. Choose from the following (or make up your own effects) depending on your preferred style of play.

***Treant Beatdown.*** Any movement causes the characters to automatically cross a sunbeam, which awakens **Grandfather Oak**. This corrupted treant has several myconids grafted onto its body. **Grandfather Oak** uses the **treant** stat block with the following change:

- The treant has the following action option: ***Pacifying Spores (3/Day**).* The treant ejects spores at one creature it can see within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The treant attacks using its Animate Trees action to add even more danger to the fight. After 3 rounds of combat, Mother Stag approaches and pretends to drive the treant away. See "Offer of Help" below.

***Perilous Exploration.*** As the party continues on through the woods, the characters must succeed on three DC 14 group Dexterity checks to avoid crossing the sunbeams. Each character gains a +2 bonus to their check if a ranger or druid is with the party. A failed check triggers a random effect. Roll a d4 to determine the effect, which targets the character or characters with the lowest check:

- Heavy, spiked nuts the size of mace heads fall from the trees, dealing 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage.
- Arboreal fungus releases a cloud of toxic spores in the area. The character must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) poison damage.
- Arboreal fungus releases a cloud of confusion spores. The character must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or have disadvantage on the next ability check they make.
- A torrent of falling spiked nuts and both types of spores assails the character.

Stopping to rest does not forgo the need to make a group check, as the sun moves across the sky and the sunbeams shift around. If the characters move through the woods at night, the moonbeams function in the same way.

After the third group check, Mother Stag arrives to "assist" the characters. See "Offer of Help" below.

***A Friendly Voice.*** Olitor the **redcap** (wrapped in the illusion of a diminutive satyr) appears, and warns the characters about the dangers of the sunbeams. He asks them to wait for Mother Stag, who arrives shortly thereafter.

The shifty Olitor tries to engage the characters in conversation, wanting to learn as much about them as possible. Any character who touches Olitor, or who succeeds on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check while watching him carefully, notices details that give the illusion away. If detected in this way, Olitor claims to have pressing business and departs.

> ##### I Call Gorgon Spit!
>The hags are not to be trusted, and characters (not to mention players) are often wise to be suspicious even at the best of times. You can adjust the encounters with the dryad-hags according to the players' reactions as you see fit. For example, if the characters are too wary to follow Mother Stag back to the cottage, she can make her appeal immediately and give them the bridle and the crowns in the woods. Or if the characters travel to the cottage and suss out the hags' true nature, the hags might try to threaten the characters into capturing Banrion, or claim that the unicorn is a greater evil—one that might destroy the woods if left unchecked. Especially if the hags' story of Banrion being an evil unicorn seems too unbelievable, the hags can claim that Banrion is a nightmare in fey disguise.
>
>Seeing through the hags' illusions without touching them requires a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. But a character who touches one of the hags does not automatically sense that the creature's form is false. The hags' clothing, their hair, and features such as Mother Stag's antlers are all real. Only by touching a hag's skin can a character detect a difference between the illusory form and the real creature beneath it—and the hags attempt to prevent such contact.
>
>If the characters attack and destroy the hags, the cottage can contain a crude map indicating the location of the clock tower bridge if the characters are likely to seek out such a mysterious site on their own. Or one of Banrion's fey servants (a **satyr**, a knightly **sprite** mounted on a **stirge**, and so forth) can be patrolling the area around the hag's cottage, and will invite the characters to meet Banrion in gratitude for them dealing with the hag threat.
>

#### Offer of Help
At some point, Mother Stag arrives on the scene, playing the part of a helpful dryad. Read or paraphrase the following:

>>You hear the sound of a singing voice approaching, heralding the arrival of an elderly dryad bearing the features of a stag. Enormous antlers grow from her head, on which hang innumerable herb pouches and charms, as well as dozens of lit candles set on the antlers' points.
>>
>>"I am Mother Stag," the dryad says. "Please do not think unkindly of our woods." As she walks toward you, she easily steps through the troublesome sunbeams without fear. "Things here were not always this way, and it troubles me that good travelers should suffer in a place they should instead find tranquil."
>>

Mother Stag offers to lead the characters to her tree cottage for soothing tea and a brief respite from their weary journey. As long as they journey with her, Mother Stag's power keeps the nefarious magic of the sunbeams at bay. She also admits that if the characters are willing, she would like to ask them for much-needed help.

***Change of Plans.*** If the characters decide to not accompany Mother Stag to the cottage—or if they attack and kill her before the offer is even made—they can continue through the woods on their own. Call for three more group checks to navigate the sunbeams, after which the characters either come upon the tree cottage or the clock tower bridge, as you determine.

![[001-001.png|right|300]]

### Tree Cottage of the Three Mothers
Mother Stag's cottage stands an hour's walk deeper into the woods. While the characters travel with her, they have no trouble with the sunbeams.

>>Within a clearing, three massive trees have grown together, their trunks entwining overhead. A hollow between them forms the interior of a dwelling, with thick branches acting as its roof. Dense patches of mushrooms grow in garden plots around this unique domicile.
>>
>>"Our cottage," Mother Stag says. "Our dryad trees—some of the last in these woods that haven't yet succumbed to Banrion's corruption."
>>

Mother Stag introduces Mother Skunk and Mother Mole, as well as their helper, Olitor (if the characters have not already met him). In their illusory guise as dryads, they offer the characters shelter and delicious food, as well as a healing tea that fully heals any damage or effects from the hazards activated by the sunbeams.

When the characters have partaken of any aid they wish to take, Mother Stag explains that the woods protected by the three mothers have fallen under the influence of an evil unicorn.

>>"Just as goodly deities assign unicorns to protect sacred places," Mother Stag explains, "Banrion serves an evil god, who sent her to corrupt these peaceful woods. Since her arrival, the dark-hearted unicorn has hunted goodly fey into near extinction, with the help of evil creatures that now serve her."
>>

#### The Dryads' Offer
The three mothers offer to serve as guides, leading the characters safely through the woods to their original destination. But in exchange, they ask for assistance in defeating this evil unicorn. They do not want Banrion killed, however. Instead, if the characters can capture the unicorn, Mother Stag claims that they can undo her corruption—and perhaps even convert her to more goodly ways. (In reality, the hags wish to capture the unicorn and force her to become their servant and mount.)

#### Bridle of Capturing
To help the characters in this task, the three mothers have corrupted a *bridle of capturing* (see *appendix C*), which can control the unicorn and allow it to be led back to them. (Even though the bridle normally targets only beasts, the hags' magic allows this bridle to target Banrion specifically.)

#### Crowns of the Forest
The dryad-hags also lend each character a woven crown of willow branches—an uncommon magic item called a *crown of the forest*. They insist that the crowns be worn at all times for the characters' own safety, claiming (truthfully) that the crowns will allow the characters to see the sunbeam tripwires and step safely through them. However, the crowns also intensify the hags' illusion of themselves as dryads and Olitor as a satyr, make the unicorn Banrion appear to be a fiendish, haggard beast, and make the fey in the unicorn's care appear as vicious kobolds.

While wearing a crown, a character automatically fails any Intelligence (Investigation) check made to see through an illusion. An illusion that is touched still has its true nature revealed. However, a character wearing the crown has such a strong sense that the illusion is real that they might not know which of their senses to believe.

If a crown is closely examined by a character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Perception) check, or with a *detect magic* spell cast using a 3rd-level or higher spell slot, the nature of its magic is discovered.

#### The Mothers' Guidance
The dryad-hags lead the characters toward the clock tower bridge, but are too frightened of the unicorn to approach any closer. They leave Olitor to guide the characters the rest of the way. The satyr-redcap leads the characters to the edge of the ruins before sneaking off to hide and spy on their progress.

#### Treasure
The cottage contains brewer's supplies, cook's tools, 250 gp, five potions (of your choice), and a *pot of awakening* (see *appendix C*).

### Clock Tower Bridge
As the characters make their way toward Banrion's lair, they come across the ruins of an old clock tower, which make an unusual and dangerous bridge.

>>The trees part to reveal the ruins of an ancient city. All that remains are worn flagstones covered in moss and lichen, toppled blocks of weathered stone, and a former tower fallen and now lying stretched across a fifty-foot-wide chasm.
>>
>>The chasm fully circles an isolated plateau of rock at its center. More ruins rise atop this plateau, including sections of walls held together by the roots of stunted trees. On the near side of the chasm, the base of the fallen tower can be seen, reduced to a broken section of its former ground floor. 
>>

#### Ruins
This city once housed the *Infernal Machine* before Lum the Mad conquered those who dwelled here and took the machine with him when he departed. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals faded carvings on the stone blocks depicting stylized aspects of daily life (hunting, worship, warfare, and so forth, with humanoid figures dressed in archaic styles of clothing). Graven lines (representing silver wires) are seen throughout the image. Any character who follows the lines discovers that they converge at a huge central representation of a massive magical-mechanical device—the *Infernal Machine*.

### Fallen Clock Tower
The collapsed structure crosses the 100-foot-deep chasm and appears extremely unstable. (Banrion can teleport across the chasm, but does so only rarely. Because she can teleport only once per day, she is wary of being stuck on the other side if the hags' servants are nearby.) The foundation of the tower still rests on the forest side of the chasm—and holds the instrument panel that formerly operated the tower's time mechanism.

The characters can attempt to cross over using the fallen tower as a bridge, or they might discover the controls within the foundation that allow the bridge to be stabilized.

#### Manual Crossing
A character can attempt to cross the chasm using the exterior of the fallen clock tower as a bridge, or using its interior as a tunnel. Either way, the character must succeed on two DC 14 Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to safely cross. Characters who are roped together gain no benefit for these checks, but are in a better position to help each other if one falls.

On a first failed check, pieces of the tower crumble and fall 100 feet to the bottom of the chasm, but the character is unharmed. On a second failed check, more crumbling rock trips up or batters the character, who takes 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage and falls. A character who is not roped to another character or some solid part of the tower falls 100 feet, taking 10d6 bludgeoning damage.

If failed checks cause significant sections of the tower to crumble, you might decide that the DC of the check to climb across increases, or that checks are made with disadvantage.

#### Using the Controls
Within the foundation of the tower on the near side of the chasm, an instrument panel is built into the wall. Characters who have seen the planar craft in *Lost Laboratory of Kwalish* recognize the design of the panel, as well as the silver wires that connect it to the rest of the tower structure.

A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check notices two gemstone-like buttons lying on the ground nearby, one a deep red and one a light blue, and both made of some unknown material. The buttons are two of the missing components of the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad*, as the characters will discover.

Two empty slots in the panel once housed the components before they fell loose. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies the components as associated with the transmutation school of magic—and specifically, with the transmutation of time. If the components are placed back in the panel, a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check allows them to be used to adjust a localized time field surrounding the tower in either direction.

***Forward and Back.*** The red component allows the time field to be adjusted toward the future. If the check to do so is successful, the tower begins to rapidly age and crumble. If advanced too far, or if any check made to operate the red component is failed by 10 or more, the tower collapses into the valley with a resounding crash.

The blue component allows the time field to be adjusted toward the past. If the check to do so is successful, the tower begins to revert back to its original condition. If this process is stopped before the tower returns to its standing position, it becomes a stable bridge that can be crossed without ability checks.

Adjusting the time field affects only the tower. Other creatures and objects that might happen to be in or on the tower at the time remain unaffected.

### Banrion's Lair
The rocky plateau beyond the chasm holds the crumbled shell of an ancient castle. Banrion the unicorn makes her home here, along with a number of goodly fey who shelter in a network of tiny tunnels within the ruins. Having long been hunted by the hags and their evil servants, these fey—including sprites, pixies, and good boggles and satyrs—are too weak and terrified to help in any fight.

The **unicorn** Banrion defends her home and its inhabitants with her life. If the characters threaten or attack her here, she fights to the finish, refusing to teleport away. But if the characters have peaceful intent (most likely because they saw through the dryad-hags' ruse, or they simply want to assess Banrion's nature themselves), they can approach unarmed and announcing themselves. With appropriate roleplaying or a DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check, Banrion accepts that the characters mean her no harm. If the hags are still at large, she beseeches the characters to help her defeat them.

#### Banrion's Offer
If the characters agree to fight the hags, Banrion joins them. But she asks that before the fight, the characters help escort the fey living in the ruins across the bridge, then manipulate the fallen clock tower back to its standing position. This seals off her plateau defensively, denying it to the hags in case she falls. (If she survives, the unicorn remains able to teleport across the chasm.) In this way, the characters discover the tower's controls if they have not already.

If asked, Banrion knows only that the clock tower was once part of an ancient city. She describes its controls as "a magical machine of gems and silver," but has not approached too closely for fear of the magic it radiates. As for who built the city, she cannot say, as it fell to ruin even before her time.

> ##### Who's Who
>In D&D canon, Lum the Mad discovered an artifact of unknown origin (reimagined in this adventure as technology from a crashed planar craft) and used it to conquer large territories in Greyhawk's world of Oerth.
>
>Opposing him was his former general, Leuk-O, who discovered a second artifact—a "relic of a visiting race of space travelers." This magic suit of powered armor became known as the *Mighty Servant of Leuk-O*.

#### Treasure
If the stones and small tunnels beneath the plateau are searched, a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check uncovers ten lengths of silver wire carefully twisted by the fey into delicate sculptures honoring Banrion. As art objects, the sculptures are worth 50 gp each.

## Aftermath
If Banrion is bridled, she must obey the characters as they deliver her to the dryad-hags. Assuming the characters don't uncover the hags' deception (or if they don't care), the unicorn's fate is a sad one, as the woods fall under the Three Mothers' corruption. 

In this event, some time after the characters depart, they are visited by a knightly **sprite** on a **stirge** mount, who has hunted the party down to demand a duel by combat. He explains what the characters have really done, and offers to lead the characters back to the woods to right their wrongs if they can be persuaded to.

If the characters defeat the hags, Banrion returns to prominence and drives the rest of the wicked fey out of the woods. Before the characters depart, she asks them to once more use the panel at the clock tower bridge, adjusting time back toward the past. Combined with her own magical influence, this allows the unicorn to separate the myconids from the trees, returning the woods to their former condition.

### Components
With the hags defeated, Banrion has no further need for the clock tower panel's magical power. She insists that the characters take the two components, both as a reward and as items worthy of magical study. (She is also keen to ensure that the panel can never be used again to adjust time, in case doing so causes the hags or their corruption to return).

If the characters research the components or the ancient city, a successful DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana or History) check leads to the discovery that the city was the site from which Lum the Mad seized the great artifact that bears his name—and that the two components were once part of that artifact.

Regardless of whether the characters take the missing components, their activity in the woods is eventually noted by spies of the two agents, **Lynx Creatlach** and **Sir Ursas** (introduced in *chapter 2*). If Olitor survives, the no-longer-disguised redcap is one of those spies, and has quietly worked for Lynx for years even while serving the hags.

# Chapter 2: An Invitation Extended
After the characters return from the woods (or at any appropriate time depending on which adventure hooks you've used), the party is sought out by two competing agents. **Lynx Creatlach** and **Sir Ursas** are both searching for any missing components from the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad*, and their spies have returned with news of the characters' knowledge or possession of the components from the clock tower. The agents look to meet with the characters, acquire the components they've found, and engage them to help find more.

If you did not run chapter 1, or if the party bypassed the clock tower entirely, you can have the agents simply contact the characters based on their reputation. Recovering the missing components is not a task for the faint of heart, and Lynx and **Sir Ursas** are looking for capable adventurers to help them.

## Background
Two archdevils—Zariel and Bel—have longed battled for control over Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. To advance their cause, both archdevils plan to rebuild the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad*, then incorporate that artifact into a powerful infernal war machine. To this end, both devils have placed competing agents into the world, tasking them with collecting as many of the missing components of the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad* as possible.

These agents, **Lynx Creatlach** and **Sir Ursas**, know of one another and of their competing agendas. They each desire to meet the characters separately, hoping to engage them to collect more of the needed missing components.

Through their own research of legends, ancient texts, journals, and the like (as well as spying on one another), both agents have located additional missing components. However, recent expeditions to the locations described in these texts has proven fruitless, with the missing components revealed as lost, destroyed, or locked away beyond mortal reach. Each agent now desires to launch a new expedition to these locations—but to a different time in the past when the missing components might still be recoverable.

## The Two Agents
The two agents reside in or close to the characters' current city or home base. If you are playing through *Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus*, you can arrange for both agents to reside in Baldur's Gate, where they seek the characters out after they arrive. Lynx and **Sir Ursas** both send couriers to deliver invitations to their respective manors.

### Special Delivery
The two agents remain engaged in a constant war of espionage against one another. Even their couriers (both neutral human **spies**) compete to deliver their respective invitations first. Roll on the Courier Conflict table to determine the outcome of the couriers' mission.

##### Courier Conflict
| d100 | Result |
|:---:|---|
| 01–12 | Lynx's courier (dressed entirely in white) arrives well ahead of **Sir Ursas**'s courier. After delivering the invitation, the courier warns them against Ursas's courier (who is dressed entirely in black), and asks for help setting traps against the courier's arrival. |
| 13–24 | Lynx's courier arrives just ahead of **Sir Ursas**'s courier. After delivering the invitation, the first courier waits nearby to ambush the second, in a location obvious to the characters. |
| 25–37 | Lynx's courier arrives and Ursas's never shows. Lynx's courier has already murdered their rival and hastily stashed the body, which is easily and eventually found in the area by the characters (along with the second invitation). |
| 38–50 | As 01–12 above, only Ursas's courier arrives well ahead of Lynx's. |
| 51–62 | As 13–24 above, only Ursas's courier arrives just ahead of Lynx's. |
| 63–74 | As 25–37 above, only Ursas's courier arrives and Lynx's never shows. |
| 75–90 | Both couriers arrive at the same time, and begin fighting immediately. |
| 91–00 | Both couriers have killed each other, with the characters stumbling across their bodies and both invitations. |

#### Invitation
Each invitation extends a formal welcome to the characters and a request to meet in person. The contents are short on details beyond the agent's name, but the invitation promises a lucrative reward for services rendered that will benefit all good and free folk, and includes a map to the respective agent's manor.

Due haste is also advised. Each invitation makes it clear that another, less scrupulous agent is interested in the characters as well, and cautions them against the machinations of this rival.

(Though both agents serve their patron archdevils with fierce loyalty, they are oddly loath to reveal the truth of the other agent's master and their rival's fiendish nature, for fear of their own master and nature being revealed in turn.)

### Assignment
When first met, each agent extends the same offer. If the characters have not already determined so on their own, the agent explains that the components they found originated in the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad*. They then offer to pay for those components already in the characters' possession, and to pay a handsome bounty for the recovery of any additional components—2,000 gp for each component (negotiable up to 4,000 gp, especially if there's a competing offer from the other agent in play).

If the characters accept, the agent they strike the deal with provides them with information on where to seek the next missing components, as well as a special construct guide programmed to transport them through space and time to reach the site.

### Lynx Creatlach
Presenting herself as a tiefling rogue, **Lynx Creatlach** talks of how she retired as an adventurer to use her assembled fortune and collected antiquities in the service of nobler causes. Chief among those causes is the defeat of the servants of the archdevil Bel. An eccentric dilettante, Lynx has had her thick horns intricately carved and inlaid with sigils and figures in silver, including multiple images of her namesake lynx. She has also lost one eye from old adventuring misfortunes, replacing it with a glass eye of hazy crystal. Several of her teeth have also been replaced with precious stones and metals.

In truth, Lynx is an active agent of Zariel but is no longer among the living. Rather, she's a lawful evil undead tiefling, with her skeleton specially crafted to retain her former skills and intellect, and bonded to an equally special flesh golem that she wears as a costumed skin. (If you are playing through *Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus*, this setup was one of Mad Maggie's creations while the hag was in Zariel's employ.) Beneath this golem costume, Lynx's bones are carved and silver-scribed in the same manner as her horns. She uses her skull, which is locked and accessed from inside the back of her mouth, as a container for her most private treasures.

#### Lynx's Manor
Lynx resides in a narrow, multistory house in a fine part of the city. While she claims ownership of the place, she has merely taken over the manor from its current owner. That owner (whose identity is left to your determination) is kept alive and bound within an extradimensional prison, treated as a permanent *Leomund's tiny hut* held inside a permanent *rope trick* spell that can be opened only by Lynx. When the rope from the spell hangs down, it is disguised as a curtain pull in the manor library.

If the characters accept Lynx's invitation, she meets them while strolling the long hallways of her manor, the walls of which are filled with fine paintings. Rather than noting their artists or subjects, however, Lynx describes each painting based on where she stole it from.

***Servants.*** The house is also occupied by a dozen servants—all **cultists** of Zariel disguised in stolen livery.

#### Lynx's Goal
Lynx states that she seeks the missing components in order to complete her version of the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad*. Her plan is to use the powerful artifact to counteract the forces of the archdevil Bel working within Baldur's Gate. She admits a rivalry with **Sir Ursas**, who she says considers Lynx a criminal for her past adventuring ways and now constantly seeks to thwart her. Lynx further states that **Sir Ursas** wants the missing components for his own lost cause of leading a war in the Nine Hells, which would invariably result in the components falling into diabolical hands.

As she talks with the characters, Lynx relates that several of the missing components are mentioned in various legends surrounding the Tomb of Horrors, but recent expeditions sent to the tomb have all failed to return. Lynx believes that an expedition should instead be sent to an earlier time in the tomb's construction, when the missing components are known to be there. She further theorizes that existing components of the *Infernal Machine* (either those the characters have brought to her, or those already in her possession) could allow time to be manipulated in some localized fashion within the tomb.

Lynx is aware that **Sir Ursas** has knowledge of other missing components that might relate to an ancient Temple of Moloch.

#### Mechanical Guide
Lynx has pulled a component from her version of the *Infernal Machine* and installed it in a magical construct resembling a silvery skeleton with decorative wings, nicknamed Eludecia. (If you connect this adventure to *Lost Laboratory of Kwalish*, the construct has been built from one of Kwalish's old designs.) If the characters possess any missing components, she asks to buy those so that they can be added to the construct as well.

See the "Mechanical Guides" section below for information on Eludecia's statistics. The construct travels with the characters, and can magically teleport them to either the Tomb of Horrors or the Temple of Moloch, transporting the party to either location in the distant past.

### Sir Ursas
The warrior **Sir Ursas** strikes an imposing figure—a massive, muscular warrior with one arm replaced with a grizzly bear's paw grafted at the elbow. He grows his dark hair long and shaggy, his eyes are bloodshot, and his complexion is consistently ruddy as if from some combination of exercise, exertion, and bellowing at subordinates. Ursas proudly claims to be the very figure depicted in *A Paladin in Hell*—a painting that has become famous throughout Faerûn—and that he lost his arm on that expedition, fighting the forces of the archdevil Zariel.

However, **Sir Ursas** is hardly the honorable knight he presents himself as. He is secretly a warrior in the service of Bel, and has sworn vengeance against all those who would oppose Bel and the archdevil's struggle to reclaim Avernus—especially followers of Zariel.

See appendix B for **Sir Ursas**'s stat block.

![[002-002.jpg|right|300]]

#### Sir Ursas's Manor
**Sir Ursas** resides in a veritable stronghold located outside the city limits. Its grounds are surrounded by a vast and intricate hedge maze under a permanent *guards and wards* spell. Any creature navigating the maze on their own without guidance must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become disoriented and lost. Such creatures are unable to find their way to the manor, as all paths appear to only exit the maze.

If the characters accept his invitation, Ursas meets them at the maze's entrance and guides them to an ornate gazebo in a hidden courtyard to talk.

***Servants.*** The stronghold is also occupied by a dozen mercenaries—all **cultists** of Bel who appear as burly and brutish fighters.

#### Sir Ursas's Goal
Ursas states that he seeks the missing components in order to complete his version of the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad*. When complete, the powerful artifact will allow him to finish the military campaign he started long ago, letting him return to Avernus and take on the forces of Zariel. Further, he is open about his rivalry with Lynx. He claims that the retired rogue is after the missing components only to add them to her collection of stolen rarities, and that she has no intention of putting them into the service of good.

As he talks with the characters, **Sir Ursas** relates that several of the missing components are mentioned in legends surrounding an ancient Temple of Moloch. Recent expeditions there have found the temple ruined and looted, and the missing components are long gone. Ursas believes that an expedition should instead be sent to an earlier time in the temple's history, when the missing components are known to be there. He further theorizes that existing components of the *Infernal Machine* (either those the characters have brought to him, or those already in his possession) could allow time to be manipulated in some localized fashion within the temple.

Ursas is aware that Lynx has knowledge of other missing components that might relate to the Tomb of Horrors.

#### Mechanical Guide
**Sir Ursas** offers the characters the services of a magical construct built to resemble a smaller version of the *Mighty Servant of Leuk-O*, and which is nicknamed Luke. The construct is powered by one of the *Infernal Machine* components Ursas has collected. If the characters possess any missing components, he asks to buy those so that they can be added to the construct as well.

See the "Mechanical Guides" section below for information on Luke's statistics. The construct travels with the characters, and can magically teleport them to either the Temple of Moloch or the Tomb of Horrors, transporting the party to either location in the distant past.

## Expedition Options
This adventure is designed to provide plenty of options for you as the DM, and to help give the players a strong sense of agency and choice.

### Agents
The characters can ally themselves with either agent, whether choosing to deal with the first agent they meet, or meeting both before making a choice. They might even meet with both in order to play one against the other. They might distrust both agents and ally with neither, instead undertaking the adventure on their own to capture the missing components and prevent them falling into the wrong hands. In the latter case, you simply need to arrange for them to gain access to their own mechanical guide, whether through theft, purchase, or an alternative patron (such as Kwalish).

### Locations
Depending on which agent they ally themselves with, the characters will initially travel to either the Tomb of Horrors or the Temple of Moloch. If you want to focus on only one location in the adventure, that's fine. But plot hooks and NPC interactions at each location give you lots of opportunity to inspire or compel the characters to travel to the second location, either after or in conjunction with exploring the first location.

### Mechanical Guides
Each mechanical guide is programmed to teleport through space and time to the adventure's set locations, effectively dropping the characters at the start of *chapter 3* or *chapter 4*. Each guide can return to its agent's manor at any time.

Each guide is an unaligned Medium construct with AC 20, 50 hit points, and a speed of 20 feet. It has no attacks, and has a +0 modifier for all its ability scores.

Each guide has 6 charges, and regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. Teleporting itself and the party to either adventure locale or back to its home manor costs a guide 1 charge. A guide can also be commanded to spend 1 or more charges to manipulate time in the local area at either adventure location. See "Manipulating Time" below for more information.

All damage dealt to a guide can be restored during a long rest with a successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools or tinker's tools. A damaged guide can also be restored to full hit points by the use of a *mending* spell or similar magic. If reduced to 0 hit points, the guide is destroyed and no longer functions—possibly stranding the characters in the distant past. *Chapter 3* and *chapter 4* each offer appropriate suggestions for how the characters might repair or replace a destroyed guide.

Each guide follows the party and obeys all the characters' commands. If two characters issue commands to the guide at the same time, you decide how the commands are resolved.

#### Working Both Sides
If the characters meet with both agents, they might agree to work for both without the other agent knowing. In that case, it's possible that they acquire both mechanical guides. You can decide whether the programming of the two constructs causes them to bicker and one-up each other—or whether each guide attempts to sabotage and destroy its counterpart. Or you might decide that they develop a mutual respect for each other, perhaps even becoming friends as a result of their shared adventures. If on friendly terms, a guide can restore any damage dealt to its counterpart during a short rest, by willingly sacrificing parts for the other.

## Manipulating Time
The ability to manipulate time at either the Tomb of Horrors or the Temple of Moloch is a fun part of the adventure, so make sure the players are clear on the parameters for doing so. The following information reflects what the characters learn from the mechanical guide they work with:

- The *Infernal Machine* components placed into the mechanical guides allow the characters to order a guide to spend 1 or more charges to alter time within individual areas of the Tomb of Horrors and the Temple of Moloch. If the localized time in an area at either site can be altered, that area's description has a "Manipulating Time" section, detailing the effects that result when a mechanical guide spends charges to alter the flow of time in that area.
- A guide spends 1 or more charges using its action. Commanding a guide to spend a charge requires no action.
- Neither the characters nor the agents know in advance which rooms are subject to localized time effects, which areas can be affected by multiple charges, whether spending charges advances or rewinds time, or if the effects will be helpful, harmful, or simply wondrous in nature. Ultimately, some amount of experimentation might be necessary.

By spending 1 or more charges in an area, a mechanical guide alters the flow of time within that area in a limited way. As time flows forward or backward, the characters see the area and its occupants move like ghosts into the future or the past, then settle back into the normal time frame once more. As was seen at the clock tower in chapter 1, this time manipulation affects only the immediate area and that area's original inhabitants. The characters, any creatures accompanying them, and any creatures that enter the area while time is shifting are not affected.

For example, having a mechanical guide spend 1 or more charges in a specific room might cause that room's occupants to move to a different location, as local time speeds forward or back to a point when those occupants are going on or off duty, starting or ending a rest period, and so on. The characters and other outside observers see the affected occupants retreating or advancing in time, but cannot interact with them.

Once the affected creatures arrive at their new time and location, they start acting as they normally would from that point forward. This means that creatures going back in time have their memories revert, such that they forget any interactions with characters in the area they just left. Likewise, time-manipulated creatures will suddenly "discover" characters if they encounter them in the area where they return to normal time.

By manipulating time in either adventure locale, NPCs and monsters can be moved into new positions so that combat can be avoided (even if that combat is already underway). Likewise, characters who fail badly in negotiations with NPCs can try to wind back the clock to replay those negotiations as desired.

# Chapter 3: Construction of Horrors
The Tomb of Horrors is one of the most legendary dungeons in the multiverse. Shaped by the demilich Acererak as a testing ground for would-be heroes—and as a place to steal the souls of those heroes whose skills where found wanting—the tomb has claimed countless lives over millennia, and even some of the most hardened adventurers would think twice about entering those deadly halls. But by going back into the past, the characters have a chance to explore a version of the Tomb of Horrors that few have ever seen, and to engage one of the world's deadliest dungeons on their own terms.

## Background
According to legend, Acererak was a tiefling fathered by a balor named **Tarnhem**. In his youth, he studied spellcasting under Vecna, and has since become an archmage of surpassing evil. While researching the means to achieve lichdom, Acererak built a number of dungeons and tombs, including his famed Tomb of Horrors. Those dungeons were created partly as a means to draw out and defeat those adventurers driven to seek and destroy him—and partly to claim those adventurers' souls to feed his phylactery.

Even after Acererak eventually became an archlich whose dark plots would threaten the world, he left behind the Tomb of Horrors as a monument to his greatness. But in its earliest stages, the tomb was a very different sort of place.

By traveling to the Tomb of Horrors in the past, the characters arrive with the place still under construction. The artificer **Moghadam** serves as the tomb's chief architect, overseeing its construction in initial areas dug out by enthralled umber hulks and refined by master artisans. As part of the unprecedented levels of magic used to create the deadly traps in the Tomb of Horrors, **Moghadam** has installed several of the missing components from the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad* at the site. These components are used to draw magical energy from the life force of creatures sacrificed on Acererak's orders—including the archmage's own father, the balor **Tarnhem**.

Over the years of the tomb's construction, **Moghadam** and his rival artificer, **Thessalar**, have competed fiercely against each other's endeavors. **Moghadam** takes pleasure in having lured away several sculptors from **Thessalar**'s temple to help with the tomb's construction. He has also recently sent a party of thieves and a master gemsmith to his rival's temple, instructing them to steal the temple's two most famous gems—set into the eyes of a great statue of Moloch—for use in the creation of Acererak's jeweled demilich skull. Unfortunately, those thieves have failed to return, and are presumed captured by **Thessalar**.

## Who Dwells Here?
This version of the Tomb of Horrors takes place in the distant past, when various legendary figures of in-game history (Acererak included) still operate as mere mortals. Several of such figures have been included as NPCs, but you should not treat this adventure's approach to those characters as canon. Rather, use them to flesh out this particular adventure in "what-if" fashion. Alternatively, if you prefer not to populate the adventure with such prominent names, you can substitute those characters with unnamed general NPCs who can fill the same roles.

Some of the NPCs in this section of the adventure (including **Moghadam**) are a much more potent threat than characters of the lower levels suggested for the adventure can safely deal with. The players should be forewarned that their characters should treat with such legendary figures carefully—a warning that is repeated by whichever agent the characters are dealing with.

### Moghadam
A legendary evil human artificer, **Moghadam** has long sought out interesting challenges for his immense intellect. As such, he considers the design of the Tomb of Horrors to be his masterwork. If questioned about his motivations, he claims that Acererak took his family hostage, and will not release them until **Moghadam** completes his work. The truth is that the artificer has no family. He delights in creating despair, and works on the tomb in the hope that his name will go down alongside Acererak's in legend.

**Moghadam** competes with a rival artificer named **Thessalar**, who operates out of a temple dedicated to Moloch some distance away. **Moghadam** has lured away several of **Thessalar**'s expert sculptors to come work on the tomb, promising them great wealth that he has no intention of paying. More recently, the architect sent his own expert gemsmith along with a group of thieves to the Temple of Moloch, so that they might steal the gemstone eyes from its most famous statue. However, the thieves were captured, and **Moghadam** is now without the gemstones or his gemsmith, and plots the means to seize both.

See *appendix B* for **Moghadam's** stat block.

### Nolzur
Fated to one day become a spellcaster of great renown, Nolzur (a neutral male human **master thief**) has not yet begun to hone his magical art in this time, but has already started a specialization in alchemy that will one day lead to the crafting of such items as his famed *Nolzur's marvelous pigments*. In this age, Nolzur most recently studied with **Thessalar**, learning secrets of alchemy and infusing his own blood with strange and dangerous properties. **Moghadam** learned of all this and captured Nolzur. He is now held in the tomb, with his blood used as a base material for magic pigments.

> ##### Who's Who
>According to game lore, Nolzur belonged to the Company of Seven, a famed group of adventurers whose names are immortalized in spells, artifacts, and magic items such as *Keoghtom's ointment*, *Quaal's feather token*, *Heward's handy haversack*, and *Tasha's hideous laughter*. Nolzur was a noted thief, illusionist, and alchemist, most famous for creating *Nolzur's marvelous pigments*.
>

### Pentival
A lawful good male half-dragon paladin in the service of Pelor, Pentival ventured to the tomb worksite along with several fellow paladins, drawn by rumors of a powerful balor bound there. Acererak spread these rumors, relying on combat between Pentival and **Tarnhem** to weaken them both, after which he could capture and imprison them for his own purposes.

Pentival uses the **half-red dragon veteran** stat block, but has the form of a gold dragon. He can be found in the chapel of evil (area 14), forced to take part in the evil ceremony there. Though Pentival has been forced to watch his fellow paladins succumb one by one to the ceremony, he has so far held out, his devotion somehow keeping him alive.

### Phenex
An **incubus** cleric of Vecna, Phenex came to this world by way of the jungles of Chult. He first occupied an abandoned temple filled with girallons, where Acererak found and recruited him with promises of power and glory.

Although Phenex remains fanatically loyal to Vecna (even to the point of removing one of his eyes and his left hand), Acererak finds him useful to his own cause as well. (The mortal Acererak still ostensibly pledges his own faith to Vecna at this time.) Since arriving at the tomb along with many of his girallons, Phenex has magically grafted on a second set of arms, making him resemble something of a girallon himself. 

### Tarnhem
A powerful **balor** and Acererak's father, **Tarnhem** has been tricked into imprisonment by his son. Above all else, the demon desires his freedom, and is willing to promise anything to those who can offer it to him.

## Missing Components
The missing components of the *Infernal Machine* at this location can be found in the chapel of evil (area 14), worked into the altar. They resemble the components found at the clock tower in *chapter 1*, being gemstone-like buttons made of some unknown material, all a deep sapphire blue.

## Mechanical Guide
If the characters' mechanical guide is lost or destroyed while they explore the Tomb of Horrors, you can make use of a number of options to keep the characters from remaining stranded in the past. **Moghadam** might offer to repair or rebuild the guide for a suitable price, and **Thessalar** makes the same offer if an overland trek is made to reach him. (The sculptors in the tomb possess maps showing the way to the Temple of Moloch.) **Tarnhem** might also be able to help restore a fallen guide using his powerful fiendish magic, but only if the characters are willing to make a deal with the demon and free him.

## Exploring the Tomb
Compared to the original *Tomb of Horrors* adventure, this version of the tomb is still in the early stages of its construction. Areas 1 to 18 match the well-known maps of the tomb closely, but the sections of the tomb beyond those areas have not yet been constructed.

Numbered locations are keyed to the map on page 18.

### Hillside
From the characters' arrival point, a busy vista unfolds at the construction site.

>>Construction of the Tomb of Horrors is well underway, focused on three tunnels being dug into the north end of a flat-topped hill covered in ugly weeds, thorns, and briars. An active workers' camp occupies the north end of the hill, above the tunnels.
>>

The rocky hill into which the tomb is being built is approximately six hundred feet wide, nine hundred feet long, and sixty feet high. Characters who ascend the hill to search the top discover a number of large black rocks dumped there. (The rocks will later be placed into the pattern of a grinning humanoid skull). A successful DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana, Nature, or Religion) check identifies the rocks as the remains of living creatures that have been reshaped to stone by dark magic. (These are the remains of worshipers from area 14.)

#### Entrance Portals
The three openings across the north side of the hill lead to areas 1 to 3. With a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, characters atop the hill can observe umber hulks and their handlers traveling to and from area 2, and humanoid workers moving to and from area 3. Area 1 appears deserted.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes several workers to emerge from inside the tomb, hauling a large black rock to add to the pile atop the hill.

### Workers' Camp
A number of tents along the north side of the hill house the tomb's workers, their food storage, equipment depots, latrines, and so forth. These workers include two dozen neutral dwarves split into two gangs. A surly, browbeaten lot, they have no interest in who the characters are or what their business at the tomb is. If talked to, they grumble about their poor food and lack of pay, with the two groups blaming each other for every worksite mishap and grievance. They flee into the tomb if threatened, but fight with picks and shovels if cornered.

Each **worker** uses the **cultist** stat block with the following changes:

- They are neutral, have a speed of 25 feet, and speak Common and Dwarven.
- They have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
- They have advantage on saving throws against the poisoned condition and resistance to poison damage.
- They have a +4 bonus to Intelligence (History) checks related to the origin of stonework.
- Their attacks with picks or hammers are treated as a scimitar attack that deals bludgeoning or piercing damage.

#### Umber Hulk Handlers
Three neutral evil dwarf **cult fanatics** wear spiky leather armor and serve as handlers for the pair of umber hulks found in area 2. They know certain command words that magically compel the hulks' obedience. The handlers carry long hooked poles to prod the hulks, and which are also enchanted to magically open and close the stone slab in area 2.

If approached, the handlers refer characters to **Moghadam** in area 1. If combat breaks out, they flee to area 2 and release the umber hulks, ordering them to dispose of the intruders. They step up to fight for themselves only if all else fails.

#### Treasure
Little of value can be found in the camp aside from personal effects. These effects include several letters offering high wages for construction workers, signed by **Moghadam**.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes a number of the dwarves to erupt into squabbling, allowing the characters to approach any of the tomb entrances without notice.

![[004-map-1-1-player.jpg|right|300]]
### 1. Office of the Artificer

>>This entrance opens up to a large stone chamber. At the far end, an intense-looking man stands behind a large stone table covered in a dense layer of plans, drawings, and other documents. Tiny wax golems, their heads all lit wicks of flame, flit about the place, keeping the objects under his gaze well illuminated.
>>
>>The man raises his head and intones: "So, you've come to engage in this grand endeavor. Are you miners, sculptors, artists? Or, I suspect, something else entirely?"
>>

**Moghadam** the artificer manages the design and construction of the Tomb of Horrors from this office. He knows he has nothing to fear from the characters, and has little personal loyalty to Acererak. As such, he is happy to listen to any tale the characters tell, and to entertain any deal they might offer.

#### Moghadam's Bargain
**Moghadam** knows about the *Infernal Machine* components in the tomb, and is quick to negotiate with the characters for them. In truth, he has no intention of parting with them and looks to subvert any deal, ideally by luring the characters to the evil chapel (area 14).

![[005-003.png|right|300]]

The artificer talks of having a number of tasks that the characters can help him with, and says he will trade the components for either of the following:

- The characters must travel to the Temple of Moloch (see *chapter 4*) to rescue the gemsmith **Seodra** and any surviving thieves sent there. They must then help those operatives complete their mission to steal the gemstone eyes from the temple's greatest statue.
- The characters can instead travel to the temple to facilitate a prisoner exchange, taking Nolzur and some of the sculptors working the tomb to exchange for the gemsmith.

The distance between the Tomb of Horrors and the Temple of Moloch is left to your determination, as are the details of the overland journey. If you don't want to play out that journey, the characters' mechanical guide can use its teleportation ability to take them to the temple.

If the characters have already been at large within the tomb and caused trouble, **Moghadam** might decide he's better off being rid of them. In that event, he might offer to trade the components in exchange for the characters meeting with Phenex and assisting in his ceremony (expecting that the priest will dispense with them), or recapturing the balor if the characters' actions have freed it (hoping that the resulting battle finishes the characters off).

If the characters enter into a deal with **Moghadam**, he writes them a magic pass that allows them to travel the tomb without being attacked by the girallons therein. **Moghadam** can communicate telepathically with anyone carrying a pass, and can teleport into an unoccupied space next to anyone carrying a pass.

#### Treasure
The stone table here is the first piece of stone cut for the tomb's excavation. It holds a number of important documents of **Moghadam**'s creation, including the master map of the tomb. This map features a notation in Undercommon: "The true master of the tomb is he who plans its construction."

Characters who have a chance to look around this area can also find *calligrapher's supplies*; a *forgery kit*; *spell scrolls* of *arcane lock*, *glyph of warding*, and *legend lore*; a *wand of secrets*; and a strongbox containing 30 pp.

### 2. Umber Hulk Pen
Before its eventual conversion into a false tomb entrance, this tunnel is being used to house a mated pair of umber hulks used as labor for the tomb's construction. During the day, they carve out tunnels for the tomb. At night and while their handlers take breaks, they are kept behind a 10-foot-thick stone block that is magically slid across the tunnel.

#### Creatures
The two **umber hulks** have symbols magically scribed on their mandibles by **Moghadam**, placing them under the effect of a permanent *dominate monster* spell. Their handlers (at area B when the characters first arrive) know the command words that compel the hulks into service.

Unless ordered otherwise, the umber hulks stay in this area, defending themselves if necessary. If the characters are at the tomb site long enough, they might witness the umber hulks carving out new areas of the dungeon in the blank part of the map.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the umber hulks to either return here to rest if they are elsewhere, or to depart for the tomb to begin work, opening or closing the stone slab accordingly.

### 3. Entrance to the Tomb

>>This broad tunnel is currently being shaped into the tomb's elaborate entryway. This is an active site, featuring a number of artisans working by lantern light to plaster the walls and paint them with bright, colorful murals. Other artisans are covering the floor in an elaborate mosaic featuring a distinct winding path of red tiles, some of which cross over a series of open pits.
>>

This area is noisy with the sounds of hammering and stone cutting coming from the west (areas 8 and 10). If the umber hulks are digging, a rumbling can also be heard to the east. But even over all that, the characters can hear a rhythmic chanting coming from the south (carried from the chapel of area 14 by the magic of Phenex's ceremony).

#### Creatures
Twelve neutral **tiefling muralists** work here, constantly mixing fresh pigments to be applied to the plaster walls. A muralist uses the **cultist** stat block with the following changes:

- It knows the *thaumaturgy* cantrip.
- It has resistance to fire damage.
- It has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.
- It speaks Common and Infernal.

A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check made by any character looking over the pigments being prepared identifies the ingredients as including impossibly bright-red blood. If questioned, the muralists talk of working in the tomb in the service of its art, which transcends all other concerns. They direct the characters either to **Moghadam** or onward to Phenex in response to any other questions.

#### Murals
If the murals are examined, read the following (from the original *Tomb of Horrors*):

>>The scenes painted show fields with kine grazing, a copse with several wolves in the background, slaves (human, orc, elf, and strange human-animal mixture: pig-human, ape-human, and dog-human) going about various tasks. Certain of the frescoes show the rooms of some building: a library filled with many books and scrolls, a torture chamber, a wizard's workroom. Chairs, windows, boxes, bales, doors, chests, birds, bats, spiders, and all manner of things are shown on the walls.
>>

#### Looking South
The muralists' lantern light illuminates the north half of this area. The details of area 6 are visible only when characters with darkvision or a light source move close enough to the end of the hall.

#### Open Pits
In several places, the winding mosaic path crosses over a series of open pits yet to be covered and concealed. The first four pits are each 10 feet deep and empty except for refuse.

The pit leading to area 7 is 30 feet deep and contains a ladder. Characters who watch this area long enough see the muralists periodically climb down into this pit, then later return with vials of bright-red blood (claimed from Nolzur in area 7) to be mixed into new pigments.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes one of the muralists to descend the southernmost pit to collect more blood from Nolzur (held in area 7). If Nolzur has been rescued, the muralists report this to **Moghadam**, who rallies available workers to hunt for the missing thief.

### 4. Side Entrance
This section of the wall has not yet been plastered or painted over, leaving an open doorway leading west. The pit before the doorway is crossed by a series of wooden planks.

### 5. Control Room

>>Through a stone archway, several banks of panels and instruments can be seen lining the walls. They crackle with sparks of eldritch energy, their dials and controls moving of their own volition.
>>

Commissioned by Acererak, the wizard Tuerny built these controls for the balor's prison in area 6. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana or Investigation) check identifies a number of silver wires that lead from these controls into area 6 and are attached to the imprisoned balor.

Anyone attempting to disrupt the controls or the wires must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) force damage. The controls and the wires are self-repairing, and cannot be severed or destroyed. However, if the ceremony is disrupted, the controls here can be set to free the balor.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area drains more energy from the balor, causing him to fall unconscious in area 6.

> ##### Who's Who
>The wizard Tuerny was the creator of the long-lost artifact called the *Iron Flask of Tuerny the Merciless*, used to trap demons, devils, and other creatures. This artifact later became the model for the lesser-but-still-legendary magic of the iron flask. According to lore, Tuerny became a nalfeshnee demon before vanishing from history.
>

### 6. Captive Balor

>>At the end of this hall, some sort of horrible binding process is underway. A balor is held against the wall, pressed in against the stonework design of a great green devil's face. A black sphere holds the demon in place, and appears to be slowly draining away its essence.
>>

The balor **Tarnhem** is bound here by the magic of Acererak, who has fashioned a device from a *sphere of annihilation* that slowly drains away **Tarnhem**'s essence to fuel the magical workings of the tomb.

A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check identifies a number of silver wires attached to the Balor and running to the control room (area 5). Anyone attempting to disrupt the controls or the wires must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) force damage. The controls and the wires are self-repairing, and cannot be severed or destroyed.

#### Bargaining with Tarnhem
If the characters are free to speak with **Tarnhem**, the balor asks them to disrupt the ceremony in the chapel (area 14), and then set the controls in area 5 to release him. To convince them to do so, the fiend promises anything within his power. As a show of good faith, he can relate how to safely open the treasure chests in area 13, and how his weapons have been taken to the chapel (area 14) and worked into the altar there.

**Tarnhem** uses the **balor** stat block with the following changes:

- While held, **Tarnhem** is incapacitated but can still speak.
- Until he recovers his weapons from the chapel, his Longsword and Whip actions are replaced by the following action option: ***Fist of Retribution**.* *Melee Weapon Attack*: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit*: 13 (2d4 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage.

If released, **Tarnhem** upholds any agreement he made to not harm the characters. He instead focuses his wrath on **Moghadam** and Phenex, hunting both down before vanishing into the rift to the Lower Planes in area 16.

If the balor is released, the sphere binding him becomes a *sphere of annihilation* and is unmoored. It travels throughout the tomb at random, though is confined by the tomb's magic to stay within its rooms and corridors rather than boring through the walls. This sphere can be controlled as normal while within the tomb, but it cannot leave.

If **Tarnhem** is not freed, the balor is eventually drained away to become part of a horrible monument. His life force fuels the black sphere in the mouth of the great green devil face in this area when the Tomb of Horrors is complete.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area reverts **Tarnhem** to an earlier period before so much of his life force was drained, awakening him if he is unconscious.

### 7. Forsaken Prison
A narrow crawl space leads here from the southernmost pit in the entrance hall (area 3). At the bottom of a 10-foot drop at the end of the crawl space, a miserable cell holds a solitary prisoner. The artisan Nolzur (a neutral male human **master thief**, but he is reduced to 1 hit point) has been captured and held here, his alchemical blood continually drained to create the magic pigments used to paint the tomb's murals. The muralists drain him with tools crafted from the beaks of stirges, keeping him barely alive with healing magic.

Nolzur is too weak to escape on his own, but if rescued and provided healing and nourishment, he gladly aids the characters in any way. This includes telling the characters the general layout of the Temple of Moloch, and revealing **Thessalar**'s vulnerability to magic potions and salves that restore hit points (see "Who Dwells Here?" in *chapter 4*).

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes one of the muralists to arrive here to collect more blood, for use in either area 3 or 10. Spending 2 charges also restores a measure of health to Nolzur, equivalent to the effect of a *cure wounds* spell.

### 8. Sculptors' Workroom
This workspace is used by a number of neutral human sculptors creating objects for use in the tomb. Five are present when the characters first enter this area, watched over and assisted by a **girallon**. The sculptors (use the **cultist** stat block) traveled here from the Temple of Moloch under the false promise of fabulous payment for helping construct the tomb. They have since found themselves unable to leave.

The sculptors seek assistance to escape the tomb, and provide whatever information they know in exchange for aid. They can relate how the rest of the sculptors (in area 10) are devising a means of escape using a set of superior *mason's tools* hidden there, and that these tools can also weaken the eidolon in the Temple of Moloch (see area 25 in *chapter 4*). They also know that the muralists are loyal to **Moghadam** and cannot be trusted.

The rhythmic chanting magically carried into area 3 grows louder in this area.

> ##### Nolzur's Gift
>If the characters help him escape from the Tomb of Horrors, Nolzur later sends them a set of his *Nolzur's marvelous pigments*, which magically arrives wherever and whenever they end up after the adventure is done. The delivery also contains a small, unpainted miniature figure representing each character. Each figure is a tiny clockwork device. If painted and kept on hand, the figures secretly animate to help the characters with small tasks whenever they sleep.
>

#### Creatures
Under the command of Phenex (area 14), the **girallon** has been ordered to obey the sculptors as they work, but to not allow them to leave the tomb. The creature carries torches in two hands to provide light for the sculptors. With the other two, it hands out hammers, chisels, and other tools as needed.

The girallon challenges the characters unless they bear one of **Moghadam**'s magical passes. In combat, it uses the implements it holds as weapons. Use the statistics for the girallon's claw attack, but a hammer attack deals bludgeoning damage and a chisel attack deals piercing damage. A torch attack deals bludgeoning damage plus 2 (1d4) fire damage.

#### Treasure
The girallon wears a golden armband (worth 250 gp) on one of its left arms, scribed by **Moghadam** with magical symbols that place the creature under the effect of a permanent *dominate monster* spell. Phenex (area 14) knows the command words that compel the girallon into service.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the girallon to leave. Roll a d4. On a 1–2, the girallon checks in with **Moghadam** in area 1. On a 3–4, it goes to see Phenex in area 14.

### 9. Artisans' Chambers
This connected series of rooms are currently being used as small apartments and storerooms for the muralists and sculptors laboring inside the tomb. The rooms are small, sparse, and minimally furnished.

The rhythmic chanting magically carried into area 3 grows louder in this area.

#### Treasure
These areas contain only personal effects, including several invitations sent from **Moghadam** for employment at the tomb and offering exorbitant wages. As well, one of the artisans has a map showing the overland route from the Temple of Moloch to the Tomb of Horrors.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes 1d4 + 1 artisans to either return here from their labors, or depart for their work.

## Exploring the Tomb (areas 10-18)

### 10. Great Hall of Spheres

>>This area is being crafted into a second grand hall. Like the entrance hall, it is a busy and noisy work site. A number of artisans are plastering the walls and painting them with bright, colorful murals that include large spheres of different colors. Other artisans work at stone cutting. Watching over them all is a massive four-armed girallon, helping to light the area by holding torches in each of its hands.
>>

#### Creatures
Five neutral human sculptors (use the **cultist** stat block) originally from the Temple of Moloch are here creating stonework for the tomb. Desperate to escape, they are working on a secret plan.

Eight neutral tiefling muralists are plastering and painting, as well as covering the floor with inlaid tiles. They use the same statistics and respond to questions in the same way as the muralists in area 3.

The **girallon** is under orders to obey the workers but not to allow them to leave the tomb. It challenges the characters unless they bear one of **Moghadam**'s magical passes, using the torches as weapons. Use the statistics for the girallon's claw attack, but a torch attack deals bludgeoning damage plus 2 (1d4) fire damage.

#### Murals
If the murals are examined, read the following (from the original *Tomb of Horrors*):

>>The walls are being painted with figures of animals, strange signs and glyphs, and humanoids posing with spheres of different colors.
>>

***Golden Sphere.*** Only one of the spheres has special significance: a golden sphere located in the northwest corner that covers the entrance to area 11. The entrance can be noticed behind the sphere, whose magic does not yet fully conceal it. However, that magic prevents anyone carrying any gold or wearing any clothing that is gold in color from passing through the sphere.

***Open Passageway.*** One section of the east wall has not yet been plastered or painted over, revealing the passageway to the chapel (area 14). The rhythmic chanting magically carried into area 3 grows louder still at the entrance to the passageway. A successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check identifies the chanting as belonging to some sort of ritual involving enchantment magic.

#### Treasure
The girallon wears a golden armband (worth 250 gp) on one of its left arms, scribed by **Moghadam** with magical symbols that place the creature under the effect of a permanent *dominate monster* spell. Phenex (area 14) knows the command words that compel the girallon into service.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the girallon to leave. Roll a d4. On a 1–2, the girallon checks in with **Moghadam** in area 1. On a 3–4, it goes to see Phenex in area 14.

### 11. Escape Room
The sculptors have utilized this side chamber to plan their escape, though none of them are present when the characters first come here.

The room is occupied by a life-sized sculpture of a winged girallon. Once it is finished, the sculptors plan to animate the statue using the information from half a *manual of stone golems* in their possession. The manual was torn in half and taken from the Temple of Moloch, where the other half still resides. If brought to life, the statue uses the **stone golem** stat block, and the sculptors use it to attack the tomb's girallon guards and flee.

If the characters earn the trust of the sculptors, the sculptors estimate completing the statue will take three days. They ask the characters to help buy them this time.

#### Treasure
The partial *manual of stone golems* is hidden beneath a pile of rocks in the corner of the room, and can be found with any search of the area. Even incomplete, it is worth 500 gp.

Additionally, the sculptors store a set of superior *mason's tools* here. These tools grant advantage when used to make an appropriate crafting check, and are worth 500 gp.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area either brings the statue one day of work closer or further from completion (a 50 percent chance for either).

### 12. False Doors
To gain time to complete their statue in area 11, the sculptors spend much of their time building, destroying, and rebuilding a number of false doors here in the great hall. Two such doors are marked at area 12 on the map.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area creates or removes a false door at random.

### 13. Chamber of Three Chests
This treasury holds resources for the construction of the tomb, including precious metals and gemstones stored here for safekeeping. A number of bones from former prisoners and creatures lie heaped about these materials, acting as magical guardians for three chests—one made of gold, one made of silver, and one made of oak.

The three locked chests can be opened with a successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. However, doing so triggers this area's protective magic.

#### Creatures
Opening the gold chest causes the bones in the room to assemble into a **giant skeleton**. Opening the silver chest results in the bones becoming a **skeletal juggernaut**. Opening the oak chest creates a **skeletal swarm** from the bones. If more than one chest is opened, these monsters each assemble in turn, with the next appearing when the previous threat is destroyed. However, if all three chests are opened simultaneously, the bones remain inanimate.

#### Treasure
Panels meant for the tomb's walls are stored here. Each panel is approximately 2 feet wide and 3 feet long, weighs 20 pounds, and is crafted from various materials of differing value:

- Twenty gleaming copper panels (worth 25 gp each)
- Twenty silver panels (50 gp each)
- Ten panels of rare woods inlaid with ivory (150 gp each)
- Five panels of ivory with gold inlaid (500 gp each)

The three chests hold the following:

- The gold chest has four *potions of greater healing*, a *potion of flying*, and a *potion of poison*.
- The silver chest contains *spell scrolls* of *guards and wards*, *summon lesser demons* (see *appendix C*), and *teleportation circle*; and a *wand of web*.
- The oak chest holds 278 pp, ninety-seven small gems (worth 10 gp each), and a peridot (5,000 gp).

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes any currently active animated skeletal creature to grow weaker or stronger. Roll a d4. On a 1–2, the creature halves its hit points. On a 3–4, the creature doubles its hit points.

### 14. Chapel of Evil

>>The chanting heard throughout the tomb originates in this chapel, whose pews are filled with more than two dozen worshipers—and, oddly, with two large chunks of rough black stone. The chapel appears dedicated to Vecna, decorated with artwork and symbols in honor of the god of evil secrets. The worshipers, all humanoid, appear exhausted as they continue their chant. As you watch, one of them collapses—and is suddenly and horrifyingly petrified into another chunk of black stone.
>>
>>At the far end of the chapel, a handsome priest stands behind an altar block that glows an opalescent blue. The priest is missing his left eye and hand, but has a second set of arms grafted to his body. All three of his arms gesture as if directing the worshipers like a conductor. Two girallons flank him, each of them also missing an eye and hand.
>>
>>The priest smiles and gestures for you to enter the chapel and take a seat. And the chanting fills your mind with a desire to obey...
>>

#### Creatures
The roughly thirty humanoids here (use the **cultist** stat block) include loyal cultists pressed into service, workers being punished, and captured prisoners. None of the worshipers (except Pentival; see below) can take any actions beyond continuing to chant as long as the priest, Phenex, commands them.

***Pentival.*** One of the prisoners includes the lawful good half-dragon paladin Pentival. Drawn to the temple by rumors of its bound balor, Pentival and his party were quickly captured. All his friends have succumbed to the magic of the temple and been transformed into black rock, but Pentival has so far held out. Of all the worshipers, he alone can communicate with the characters, quickly explaining who he is and the nature of the ceremony.

If freed, Pentival joins the characters for the remainder of their time at the tomb. He uses the **half-red dragon veteran** stat block, but has the form of a gold dragon. However, he insists on keeping **Tarnhem** imprisoned, and on attempting to destroy **Moghadam**.

***Phenex.*** An **incubus** cleric of Vecna, Phenex directs the dark ceremony here. As long as he commands the worshipers (using a bonus action each round), they maintain their chant.

In combat, Phenex first orders the girallons to attack. As needed, he then uses his Charm action to force a character or Pentival to defend him. Due to his fanatic devotion, Phenex does not use his Etherealness action to escape a fight, but remains in the chapel to the bitter end.

***Girallons.*** The two girallons that protect Phenex have each had a left hand and eye removed. They use the **girallon** stat block but can make only three claw attacks as part of their multiattack action.

#### Ceremony
As long as the worshipers chant, the ceremony fueling the balor's prison (area 6) remains active. They continue to chant while they are physically able and while Phenex commands them. The ceremony fuels Phenex as well, allowing him to maintain it without need for sustenance or sleep.

Anyone entering the chapel while the ceremony is underway must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or fall under an effect equivalent to a *mass suggestion* spell. While a character is under this effect, Phenex can direct them to sit and join the ceremony. Any character who does so takes up the chant, and has their Constitution score reduced by 1 each round on initiative count 0. A character reduced to 0 hit points while under this effect dies and has their body and all possessions transformed into a chunk of black rock (see below). A character under the effect of the ceremony can make another saving throw at the end of each turn, ending the effect with a success.

(This version of the ceremony is more potent than that suffered by the other worshipers, who would otherwise have all turned to black rock by now. Phenex is concentrating his magic in an effort to defeat the characters.)

If Phenex is defeated, any remaining worshipers immediately cease chanting and collapse into exhausted unconsciousness. Once a character is freed from the ceremony and out of combat, their hit point maximum is restored at a rate of 1 hit point per round. Anyone transformed into a black rock unfortunately remains in this condition.

#### Black Rocks
When a worshiper's life energy has been drained by the ceremony, they are transformed into a large black rock, carried out of the tomb, and set on the hillside (where they'll eventually form the image of a grinning skull). A *greater restoration* or *wish* spell can end the petrified condition for one victim, restoring them and their gear.

#### Altar
This block of strange material glows with an inner light of opalescent blue, owing to the missing components of the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad* wired into its workings. There are three such components, each a deep sapphire blue. Removing one component safely requires a successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, jeweler's tools, or tinker's tools.

In addition, **Tarnhem**'s flaming whip and lightning-imbued longsword have also been worked into the altar. On a failed check to remove a missing component, these weapons cast a *lightning bolt* or a *fireball* at the character making the check (a 50 percent chance for either spell; save DC 16 for both). If **Tarnhem** is freed, he comes here directly to recover these weapons, and is the only creature that can do so. Anyone else attempting to claim them automatically triggers a *lightning bolt* or a *fireball*.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area reverts one of the black rocks back to a living worshiper.

### 15. Secret Door
A secret door here leads to a hallway beyond. The door is unlocked and can be found with a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check.

### 16. Rift to the Lower Planes
The ceremony that summoned **Tarnhem** resulted in an unstable rift to the Lower Planes opening up in this area. The far end of the hallway is scribed with glyphs and sigils, and leads to an open fiery pit—a portal to the Abyss. The unstable magic of the portal prevents any creature that is not a fiend from stepping through it. If **Tarnhem** is freed, he eventually comes this way and escapes.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes a ripple in the rift's magic, allowing a creature to pass through it into the tomb. Roll a d6. On a 1–5, treat this effect as a *summon lesser demons* spell. On a 5–6, treat it as a *summon greater demon* spell. (See *appendix C* for both those spells.) Pick one character at random to be treated as the summoner.

### 17. Flooding Pit
The corridor beyond the secret door at area 15 contains three open 10-foot-deep pits. Lying at the bottom of each pit, a number of skeletons are shackled to the walls. In addition, the outline of a door on the south wall of each pit can be seen.

![[006-004.png|right|300]]

#### Flooding Trap
The first two pits are trapped, such that anyone trying the false door at the bottom causes a stone slab to slide across the opening, the skeletons to animate (see below), and the pit to begin filling with water. It takes 5 rounds to completely fill a pit, leaving no air space at the top. After one hour, the slab opens and the water drains away.

A successful DC 20 Strength check allows a character inside or outside the pit to pry the slab open, allowing escape from the pit. A character proficient with mason's tools can also make a DC 18 Dexterity check using those tools, cracking open the slab on a success.

#### Creatures
The first pit contains four humanoid **skeletons**. The second contains two umber hulk exoskeletons (use the **minotaur skeleton** stat block, but treat its greataxe attack as a claws attack and its gore attack as a mandibles attack). The third looks like it contains the skeleton of a large wolf-headed humanoid, but a successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals that the creature is a mix of humanoid and animal bones. The bones do not animate.

When either of the first two pits are sealed, the skeletons within animate. They remain shackled to the walls, but attack any character in the pit to hinder any attempt to escape from the flooding chamber.

#### True Doorway
The third pit contains an actual door leading to area 18.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area opens one closed pit at random, or closes one pit at random if all the pits are open.

### 18. Guardian Door

>>A mithral door in the stone wall resembles the figure of a flattened tortle, its arms and legs extended to the four corners, and its shell carved with a complete map of the tomb. Its head is turned in profile, its eye set with a gleaming gem.
>>

When any character approaches the door, the tortle's head animates and intones: "Are you the master?"

#### Opening Riddle
The door unlocks automatically for **Moghadam** or **Seodra** the gemsmith. To anyone else, it repeatedly asks, "Who is the master?" The correct answer to the question can be found in **Moghadam**'s office (area 1): "The true master of the tomb is he who plans its construction." With any answer other than that phrase or the name "**Moghadam**," the door replies that the speaker is not the master and refuses to open.

#### Soul Gem
The door's eye is gem set with a smaller version of one of a demilich's soul gems. The gem can be removed only by a character proficient with jeweler's tools who succeeds on a DC 13 Dexterity check using the superior jeweler's tools found in area 31 of *chapter 4*. A successful check removes the soul gem, which destroys the gem and unlocks the door.

A character who attempts to remove or destroy the gem in any other way must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) force damage.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the door to intone: "The master does not resort to feeble manipulations of a clock to open this door. You are not the master."

### 18a. Gemsmith's Workshop
**Seodra**, a master gemsmith in the employ of **Moghadam**, maintains her workshop here, although she is currently a prisoner in the Temple of Moloch (see *chapter 4*).

>>Beyond the door, a series of overlapping curtains embroidered with a pattern of silvery spiderwebs drape across a stairway leading down.
>>

#### Curtains
The first three curtains are sheets of thick webbing that function as the product of the *web* spell. The fourth is a disguised **trapper** kept by **Seodra** as a pet, and which attacks anyone who passes by it except **Seodra** and **Moghadam**.

Once the characters move beyond the curtains, read:

>>This workshop features a number of tables covered in *jeweler's tools* and materials—including three large diamonds. Set against the back wall is a couch upholstered in golden cloth, on which rests a headless body outfitted in elaborate robes.
>>

When the first character descends the stairs, the body rises to its feet.

#### Creature
The body is a **greater zombie**, used by **Seodra** as a manikin and animated assistant. It automatically stands up whenever anyone enters the workshop, but does not attack unless **Seodra**'s gems are touched (see below).

#### Treasure
In addition to a set of *jeweler's tools*, one worktable contains plans for crafting the jeweled silver skull of a demilich. The three large diamonds (worth 1,000 gp each) have already been cut and fashioned into teeth. These are meant for the skull currently in **Seodra**'s possession (see *chapter 4*).

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the manikin to approach the table and indefinitely pantomime searching for its missing head. Spending 2 charges causes it to search briefly, then settle back down to the couch, where it remains inert until anyone new enters the workshop.

> ##### Completing the Skull
>If **Seodra** has all six diamond teeth (the three in the Tomb of Horrors, along with the three she has with her in area 31 of chapter 4), the jeweled eyes from the great statue in the Temple of Moloch (area 25 of *chapter 4*), and the silver skull (also in area 31 of chapter 4), she will have all she needs to complete Acererak's demilich skull.
>
>The magic of the ritual that creates the skull shrinks down the great rubies of Moloch's eyes to fit the silver skull. The last stage of the ritual involves placing the finished skull atop the manikin in area 18a. The spirit of the archmage Acererak then possesses the manikin and transforms it into an eye of fear and flame. If the characters are present, they can treat with Acererak in this form.
>
>The **eye of fear and flame** attacks at once if the characters are known to have undertaken any actions against **Moghadam**, the tomb, or its workers. If not, and if Acererak is impressed with their adventuring acumen, the archmage promises to grant a great boon in exchange for some measure of service necessary for the completion of his tomb. The details of the service are left to your determination. The boon can be the equivalent of a *wish* spell, though whether or not Acererak fulfills any promise is left to you to decide.

# Chapter 4: Temple of Moloch
The Temple of Moloch is an ancient site steeped in magic, and the former home of a legendary artificer. **Thessalar** was a master alchemist and creator of monsters, whose own blood was said to possess dire magical properties. The artificer's mad plots, thirst for power, and pursuit of lichdom eventually left the temple a ruin long ago. But the characters now find themselves back in that long ago, facing off against the artificer and his host of monstrous guardians in pursuit of the missing components of the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad*. Having come back in time, the characters have a unique opportunity to explore a site now lost to memory—and to lay claim to its legendary riches.

## Background
The Temple of Moloch was said to have begun as a series of caverns where the elemental princes Olhydra and Ogrémoch once battled, and in so doing, opened a rift to their respective Elemental Planes. This rift between the Plane of Water and the Plane of Earth resulted in a stream flowing through the caverns, which carries with it gemstones of extreme size and quality—particularly rubies. When ancient peoples came upon these gems, their greed led them to gather as many as possible, and to build a temple at the site to honor Moloch. They built an ornate statue to the exiled archdevil, and set two of the largest ruby gemstones for its eyes.

Centuries later, one of the high priests of the temple, an artificer named **Thessalar**, was so seduced by power and authority that he slew most of his fellow cultists in a bloody ceremony, then took control of the temple for himself. **Thessalar** repurposed the chambers of the temple for his own experiments, creating numerous monsters that bore his name (including the thessalhydra), as well as unnatural beasts such as the owlbear that would one day spread across the world.

Several of the missing components of the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad* made their way to the temple through the years. At the time the characters visit, **Thessalar** has installed these components in his lab equipment, channeling their magic for the purpose of endless mutation.

Over the years that were the height of **Thessalar**'s power in the temple, the artificer's chief rival was the artificer **Moghadam**, architect of the Tomb of Horrors. **Moghadam** recently lured away several sculptors from **Thessalar**'s temple to help construct his tomb, with false promises of vast salaries. To add insult to injury, **Moghadam** then sent back a party of mercenary thieves and a master gemsmith to steal the temple's most famous gems—the eyes of the great statue of Moloch that is the centerpiece of the site. These thieves came under the pretense of delivering animal subjects for **Thessalar**'s experiments, but were captured. The gemsmith **Seodra** is now forced to labor for **Thessalar**, while the thieves are the subjects of dark experiments. All are desperate to escape.

## Who Dwells Here?
As with the Tomb of Horrors, this version of the temple takes place in a period of the distant past, and incorporates rare elements of D&D lore. You are, of course, free to use or not use such elements—**Thessalar**, the creation of the owlbear, and so forth—as you see fit. You can easily substitute **Thessalar** or any other NPCs in the adventure with characters specific to your campaign, or with general NPCs who can fill the same roles.

Several of the temple's residents (including **Thessalar**, his thessalkraken, and the eidolon) are a much more potent threat than characters of the lower levels suggested for the adventure can safely deal with. The players should be forewarned that their characters should treat with such legendary figures carefully—a warning that is repeated by whichever agent the characters are dealing with.

### Andras and Stolos
One of **Thessalar**'s most loyal assistants, Andrastolos was the subject of many of the artificer's early magical trials. In a grand experiment, Andrastolos's body and mind were split across two separate beings: **Andras** and **Stolos**. Although they both operate in the temple, their split nature and the memory of who they once were disturbs **Andras** and **Stolos** so much that they seek each other's ruin. The only thing that keeps both from killing the other is a desperate belief that their original natures might somehow be restored.

#### Andras
**Andras** is a neutral evil male human assassin with the head of a giant snowy owl. Though he retains his full intellect, his speech is hindered, resembling the hoots and clicks of an owl. Cruel and sadistic, **Andras** has been installed as the temple's torturer. When the characters arrive, he is overseeing the interrogation of **Moghadam**'s thieves and their wererat leader, Mack Francache. See area 9 for **Andras**'s full statistics.

#### Stolos
A reverse of **Andras**, the neutral **Stolos** possesses the head of an aging man atop the body of a giant owl. Garrulous and inquisitive, **Stolos** has been installed as the temple's warden, overseeing the prison and the unfortunate creatures held there. **Stolos** is a warlock of the Great Old One, but see area 11 for his full statistics.

### Ard-Sagart
Under **Thessalar**, the high priests of the temple are chosen from sculptors who craft such perfect statues that the temple's resident eidolon (containing the spirit of the first high priest) selects them for its use. As the temple's current high priest, Ard-Sagart (a lawful evil male human **warlock of the fiend**) believes that the wayward sculptors who left for the Tomb of Horrors have caused the temple to lose favor with Moloch. He is eager to rectify this situation by recovering as many gemstones as possible from the temple's waters as tribute.

### Barbatos
The ranger **Barbatos** (a neutral evil male human; see *appendix B* for his stat block) uses his tracking, stealth, and combat prowess to trap creatures for selfish gain. He has long worked for **Thessalar**, trapping animals and monsters to be used in the temple's experiments. As part of his wages, **Barbatos** has undergone his own experimentation, with **Thessalar** wiring items made from living creatures directly into the ranger's body.

**Barbatos** is always accompanied by his animal companion, a **hell hound** named Sadie III.

### Mack Francache
This neutral **wererat** thief is the leader of the band sent to the temple by **Moghadam**, and charged with stealing the ruby eyes from the temple's great statue of Moloch. Having failed in his assignment, Francache now languishes in the temple's torture chamber.

### Seodra
A lawful neutral female genasi from the Quasi-elemental Plane of Mineral, **Seodra** is a gemsmith who studied under Xagy, the mysterious figure who crafted such masterpiece artifacts as *Queen Ehlissa's Marvelous Nightingale*. **Seodra** accompanied Mack Francache and his thieves to the temple, as her expertise was needed to steal the gem eyes of the great statue of Moloch without damaging them. With the gems in hand, **Seodra** would have been able to craft the jeweled skull of a demilich for Acererak. Unfortunately, she was captured along with the rest of the thieves, and is now forced to work for **Thessalar**—crafting the same jeweled skull for his own use. See area 31 for her statistics.

### Thessalar
As an artificer, **Thessalar** is vainglorious, egotistical, and utterly ruthless in furthering his research. His career began as a priest in the service of Moloch, where he rose through the ranks before eventually taking over the temple as a working laboratory. Most of his experiments have involved the pursuit of new forms of life, resulting in such creatures as the thessalhydra and the owlbear. In recent years, he has also researched the prolonging of life—namely his own. **Thessalar** hopes that by becoming a lich, his research and experiments can continue indefinitely.

Over time, **Thessalar** has subjected himself to so many of his own experiments that his blood has taken on alchemical and magical properties. He regularly uses it as the basis for many of the reagents used throughout his labs. As a side effect, although **Thessalar** is now immune to poison and the poisoned condition, any magical liquid or salve that restores hit points acts as a poison against him if applied to a piercing or slashing weapon.

Several of **Thessalar**'s prized sculptors have been lured away from the temple by **Moghadam**, his rival artificer, with promises of false payment to help construct the Tomb of Horrors. Worse, the sculptors took with them their best tools and half a *manual of stone golems*. Both items were part of **Thessalar**'s plans to craft a powerful stone golem and send it against **Moghadam** and his tomb. More recently, **Moghadam** ordered a group of thieves to assault the temple and steal the gemstone eyes from its great statue of Moloch. **Thessalar** captured the thieves and put the gemsmith accompanying them to work, but the temple still remains on alert against intruders.

See *appendix B* for **Thessalar**'s stat block.

> ##### Who's Who
>Little is known regarding Xagy—except as a partial anagram for 'Gygax,' and for her role in crafting Queen Ehlissa's Marvelous Nightingale, one of the artifacts appearing in the first edition *Dungeon Masters Guide*. When operated, this magical-mechanical marvel would shoot eye rays of different colors and effects, and produce songs able to work magical wonders.
>

## Missing Components
The missing components of the *Infernal Machine* at this location can be found in various laboratory chambers throughout the temple. Removing the components deactivates various controls within these chambers, disrupting experiments and freeing creatures.

The components resemble those found at the clock tower in *chapter 1*, being gemstone-like buttons made of some unknown material and of various colors. The missing components are disbursed as follows:

- Area 9. One component, speckled gold
- Area 14. One component, cloudy orange
- Area 15. Three components, all emerald green
- Area 16. One component, light purple
- Area 22. One component, hazy yellow

## Mechanical Guide
If the characters' mechanical guide is lost or destroyed while they explore the Temple of Moloch, you can make use of a number of options to keep the characters from remaining stranded in the past. **Thessalar** can repair or rebuild the guide for a suitable price, as can **Moghadam** if an overland trek is made to reach him. (The sculptors in the temple possess maps showing the way to the Tomb of Horrors.) Alternatively, replacement parts for the guide might be recovered from the bottom of the underground lake at the end of the adventure—if the characters are able to deal with the thessalkraken!

## Exploring the Temple
The temple is divided into two main sections. Areas 1 through 23 are the working laboratories where **Thessalar** resides and operates, along with many lizardfolk guards. Areas 24 through 39 make up the temple section, largely inhabited by priests and others who care for the temple's statues as well as its living demigod, the thessalkraken. That creature dwells in a deep subterranean lake beyond areas 30 and 39.

Numbered locations are keyed to the map on page 29.

### Temple Approach
From the point at which the characters arrive outside the temple, they find themselves within striking distance of a small, isolated village. The villagers—quiet, nervous folk—can provide lodging, meager supplies to trade, and directions to the temple.

From the village, a two-mile trek along a seldom-used road ends at the edge of a fen.

>>A general bleakness hangs over this area, with only a few clumps of brush and tamarack sprouting here and there. Through this, a narrow causeway leads out to a low mound, upon which stand the outer walls of what must be the temple.
>>

The upper levels of the temple are abandoned and falling to ruin, as **Thessalar** focuses his activities in the dungeons below. Once the characters cross the causeway, they easily spot a stone staircase leading down.

![[007-005.png|right|300]]

### Never Alone
As the characters explore the Temple of Moloch, keep in mind that this is an active, living dungeon filled with guards, servants, and monsters. Different areas provide information on lizardfolk guards heading out on patrol and monsters potentially breaking free and running amok. When that happens, keep a rough idea of where those guards and monsters might be heading, and let the characters hear or see them as they skulk about. Not every encounter with a wandering monster or patrol needs to end in combat, but knowing that they don't have free run of the dungeon will help keep the characters on their toes.

In addition to those potential encounters, two unusual monsters also patrol the temple complex, and can be encountered at any time, wandering through any corridors or rooms—a thessalhydra and another creation of **Moghadam**'s known as the thessalheart construct.

#### Thessalhydra
When the characters first enter the temple, roll a d4. On a 1–2, the temple's guardian **thessalhydra** is patrolling the laboratory section (areas 1 to 23). On a 3–4, it patrols the temple section (areas 24 to 39). There are no fixed mechanics for encounters with the thessalhydra, but feel free to have it show up in the distance whenever the characters need incentive to keep moving. The thessalhydra ignores lizardfolk guards and known servants of **Thessalar**, but attacks all other creatures on sight. Accustomed to inspiring fear, and having grown somewhat lazy in its guardian role, it is usually content to let foes flee from it rather than pursuing.

Each time the characters finish a long rest in the temple, the thessalhydra leaves its current zone and takes up a patrol in the other zone. The thessalheart construct switches to the opposite zone (see below).

#### Thessalheart Construct
The **thessalheart construct** is a strange magical-mechanical device that struts about like a chicken, and which features a human heart beating madly behind its glass front. The construct always wanders the zone opposite to the thessalhydra's zone, and for good reason.

The human heart that sits within the construct is magically connected to the thessalhydra, tapping into the power of the *Infernal Machine* components as it roams, and feeding that power to the monster as restorative energy. Whenever the thessalhydra is taken to 0 hit points, it stays dead for 1 hour before returning to life with full hit points. Destroying the construct or claiming all the *Infernal Machine* components is the only way to end this effect.

The thessalheart construct has a telepathic bond to **Thessalar**, who becomes aware of the characters through the construct's senses if they encounter it as they wander. If encountered, the construct gets close enough to identify the characters, then attempts to flee to protect itself.

![[009-map-1-2-player.jpg|right|300]]
### 1. Entry Chamber

>>Stairs from the surface lead down to this damp vaulted chamber. The floor is strewn with bones and rubble. The ceiling is supported by arches meeting at the twenty-foot-high domed peak, and is obscured by thick webs. Corridors lead off to the east, south, and west, with the west ending at a heavy oak door with bronze fittings. 
>>

#### Arrow Slit
Any character who succeeds on a DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check notices an arrow slit concealed in a gap in the stairwell stones. The guards in area 5 watch the stairs through this slit, giving them a warning of the characters' approach.

#### Oak Door
Anyone who listens at the door to the west and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check hears a moaning that rises and fades away (caused by strong breezes in area 2). Opening the door causes the breeze to fill this corridor, creating the effect of a *gust of wind* spell.

#### Creature
The webs on the ceiling conceal a mutated giant spider with the beak of a giant owl (use the **grell** stat block). This creature escaped from **Thessalar**'s labs and has been allowed to lair here to watch over the entrance. The lizardfolk have nicknamed it "Thacko."

#### Treasure
A character who searches the chamber and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check finds 19 sp and a small ruby (worth 20 gp) inside a lizardfolk skull.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the guards in area 5 to change shifts, allowing the characters to pass through here without being noticed. Spending 2 charges also causes Thacko to grow younger or older. Roll a d4. On a 1–2, the creature halves its hit points. On a 3–4, the creature doubles its hit points.

### 2. Water Room
This natural cavern provides fresh water for the temple from the cold and fast-flowing stream along its western edge. The stream enters from the north along a tunnel, and exits to the south in the same manner. A cold wind blows from the south tunnel, generated above the subterranean lake the stream flows into (accessed via area 30 or area 39).

Numerous barrels, casks, and buckets are stored here, all used to collect fresh water.

#### Pool
The stream forms a small pool 7 feet deep at its center, which is home to numerous small, white blindfish and crayfish. An unusual mineral formation occupies the bottom of the pool. With a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character identifies the formation as a limed-over skeleton.

#### Tunnels
The tunnel to the north has no air space within it, and leads back to the underground spring that is the stream's source. The tunnel to the south is higher, leaving an ample air space along which the brisk wind is channeled. Characters can make an arduous journey along the south tunnel to the underground lake (see that section at the end of the adventure), encountering hazards and monsters as you determine.

#### Skeleton
The skeleton is the remains of the temple's first high priest (whose spirit now resides as the eidolon in area 25). If the skeleton is examined by a creature in the water, a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals a key in its hand. (This fits the secret door leading to the treasure vault in area 38). The key can be easily claimed, but doing so disturbs the skeleton and causes a cylindrical object to dislodge from it. This object is carried off by the stream unless any character in or out of the water succeeds on a DC 18 Dexterity check to snag it.

#### Treasure
The watertight ivory tube dislodged by the skeleton contains a vellum map of the temple complex. However, slow seepage has blurred all but a small portion, so that the map now shows only area 1; area 2; the passage to area 3, with that area only a smudge; and the passage to area 26, starting about 20 feet south of the secret door in area 3.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 or more charges in this area creates a 10 percent cumulative chance for a ruby (worth 1d10 × 10 gp) to wash into view from upstream, as well as a 25 percent cumulative chance for 1d4 **lizardfolk** to arrive on assignment to bring more water into the temple.

Additionally, if 2 or more charges are spent, enough of the lime flakes off the skeleton in the pool that it can be identified without an ability check.

### 3. Empty Ceremonial Chamber

>>This chamber resembles a larger version of the entry, with arches meeting at the twenty-five-foot domed peak of the ceiling. A nine-foot-tall wooden platform stands against the south wall, on which several bodies lie wrapped in funeral shrouds.
>>

The wooden platform is used as a dais for religious rites. The faithful are brought here after death, blessed, and then carried to their final resting place in the subterranean lake (where they are consumed by the thessalkraken). The bodies currently upon the platform are four lizardfolk slain during the capture of **Moghadam**'s thieves, as well as one of those thieves (a female human).

#### Secret Door
Seven small knobs of stone protrude from the south wall at the level of the platform. A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check notices which three knobs show the most wear. Pressing those knobs in any order opens the secret door.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area results in four **lizardfolk** guards and a **lizardfolk shaman** opening the secret door to the south and conveying the bodies down the south corridor before vanishing from sight.

### 4. Guardroom
Since **Moghadam**'s thieves came to the temple, **Thessalar** has had the temple on heightened alert and guards stationed around the entrance at all times.

#### Creatures
Eight **lizardfolk**, a **lizardfolk shaman**, and the shaman's **two-headed crocodile** companion rest in this area. If they are alerted to intruders by the lizardfolk in area 5, they head directly for area 1 to challenge them.

#### Secret Tunnel
A secret trapdoor in the floor opens to an access tunnel leading to area 5. It can be found with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the guards to change shifts, leaving for the barracks (area 6). Spending 2 charges reverses time and causes them to instead head into the temple complex to search for **Moghadam**'s thieves, believing the thieves have just arrived. You determine where the guards might be encountered as a result.

### 5. Watch Room
The guards here are companions of the force resting in area 4. They are on active duty, watching the stairs down into area 1.

#### Creatures
If the four **lizardfolk** stationed here spot intruders, two of them travel through the secret tunnel to alert the guards in area 4 and join their hunt. The other two remain here to watch for additional foes descending the stairs, but head out in pursuit of the characters if their allies don't return within a few minutes.

#### Arrow Slit
An arrow slit opens up in a gap in the stairwell stones, and provides a view of any creatures descending the stairs into area 1.

#### Secret Tunnel
A secret trapdoor in the floor opens to an access tunnel leading to area 4. It can be found with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the guards to change shifts, leaving here for the barracks (area 6). Spending 2 charges causes them to instead head into the temple complex to search for **Moghadam**'s thieves, believing the thieves have just arrived. You determine where the guards might be encountered as a result.

### 6. Barracks
This cluttered chamber serves as a barracks for **Thessalar**'s lizardfolk servants. Crude sleeping pallets line the walls, and the place has a foul smell.

#### Creatures
Eight **lizardfolk** are off duty here, sleeping or leisurely playing at a rudimentary board game using dice and small stones as playing pieces. If they have been alerted to trouble by the lizardfolk in areas 4 or 5, they head into the temple to challenge intruders.

#### Prisoner
A gruesome scene plays out along the east wall. One of **Moghadam**'s thieves hangs from manacles there, dead, torn open, and with his innards hanging out, having been given to the lizardfolk to consume.

#### Treasure
A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check made to search through the lizardfolk's possessions uncovers 25 cp, 55 sp, and 10 gp.

In addition, twelve uncut rubies (worth 50 gp each) are being used as pieces for the board game. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals that the board resembles a partial map of the temple, showing areas 1 to 22.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the guards to change shifts, leaving for areas 4 and 5. Spending 2 charges also brings the prisoner back to life. Little Gadai is a lawful neutral human **spy**. He joins the characters if allowed to, seeking to rescue and rejoin the other thieves to complete their original mission. His knowledge of the temple is limited to areas 1 through 6.

### 7. Storage Area
This is a general storage area for the temple, holding crates, sacks, and barrels filled with typical goods in support of temple operations (foodstuffs, cloth, oil, tools, and so forth).

Characters who search this area thoroughly might make an unusual discovery with a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check, allowing one check per character. Use the Storage Area Discoveries table to determine what a character discovers, or as inspiration for unusual discoveries of your own.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 or more charges in this area has a 20 percent cumulative chance that 1d4 **lizardfolk** guards arrive to fetch more supplies for the temple. They attack intruders at once.

##### Storage Area Discoveries
| d100 | Discovery |
|:---:|---|
| 01–05 | A pile of moldy sacks is contaminated with toxic mold. The character who discovers them must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. |
| 06–15 | A tiny **mimic** is disguised as a sack. The mimic deals half damage with its pseudopod and bite attacks, and has only 1 hit point. |
| 16–25 | A small box holds one *gauntlet of ogre power* and one *boot of striding and springing*. There is no sign of either item's missing mate unless you want to have it found elsewhere in the adventure. |
| 26–35 | A live parrot in a wicker cage (captured by **Barbatos** and stashed here pending use in laboratory experiments). The bird claims their name is 'Hector.' |
| 36–45 | A small barrel holds a live **boggle**, bound, gagged, and marinating in their own excreted oil. This is the former partner of the boggle steward in areas 36 and 37, who betrayed and left this boggle here in order to pose as both stewards and reap twice the salary. You decide whether this boggle bolts and flees the dungeon if rescued, or whether they accompany the characters to seek vengeance. |
| 46–55 | A cookbook written in Goblin sits in a cast iron skillet that can be used as a mace. The skillet is engraved in Goblin with the words: PUT IN FIRE FOR COOKING. |
| 56–65 | A small book is found, colorfully illustrated and offering a variety of rumors and advice regarding monsters and dungeons, information on various items of specialized adventuring gear, and short pieces of fiction. |
| 66–70 | An empty sack is an uncommon magic item that spits out a random mundane object once per day. Select these items from the *trinkets table* in chapter 5 of the *Player's Handbook*, or choose any random nonmagical item. |
| 71–80 | A long piece of oilcloth wraps up a number of missing levers to an *apparatus of Kwalish* (to be found in area 29). |
| 81–85 | A small sack is revealed to be a *bag of beans* containing six beans. |
| 86–90 | A piece of parchment hidden under a crate appears to be a magic treasure map. If the map is not followed to its end within 30 days, it rewrites itself as an entirely new map and any copies made of it turn blank. There is a 50 percent chance that the map leads to an actual treasure. If not, it leads to a dangerous monster with no treasure. |
| 91–96 | A sack holds a common magic item and 1d4 potions, all of your choice. |
| 97–99 | A leather case holds an uncommon magic item and 1d4 scrolls, all of your choice. |
| 00 | A box holds a rare magic item of your choice. |

### 8. Office of the Torturer
Characters approaching this area from the north can see activity through the open doorway to area 9, but can't make out any details until they advance beyond the corridor leading into area 8.

This chamber serves as the office and apartment of **Andras**, the temple's torturer and rival of the warden. It holds a bed, a desk, and mundane gear. The desk contains notes on tortured prisoners and any information they've revealed (including the fact that the recently captured thieves were sent by **Moghadam**). If he is not at work in area 9, **Andras** will be found here.

#### Treasure
A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check made to search the desk uncovers several papers stolen from **Stolos** (see area 11), which discuss the split nature of **Andras** and **Stolos**.

In addition, a locked strongbox can be found under **Andras**'s bed. It can be opened with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, but contains an easily noticed poison needle trap. A failed check triggers the trap, which deals 1 piercing damage and delivers a dose of *blood of the lycanthrope poison* (see *appendix C*). The strongbox can be smashed open with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

The strongbox holds treasure collected from **Andras**'s recent victims—110 sp, 55 gp, 10 pp, five rubies (worth 100 gp each), and a vial of *mummy rot antidote* (see *appendix C*).

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes **Andras** to return here from area 9 and prepare to rest.

## Exploring the Temple (areas 9-16)

### 9. Torture Chamber
The characters can hear what's happening in this area before they see it. Read the following if any character approaches within 30 feet of the open doorway:

>>A low groaning rises from this chamber, whose open doorway provides a hint of its source. This is a torture chamber, filled with racks, implements of pain, and other foul devices.
>>

As the characters enter, read the following, making adjustments as necessary if **Andras** is not here:

>>Two prisoners and a frantic rat lie strapped to tables, and are being worked on by a humanoid figure with the head of a snowy owl. Silver wires connect the tables to a complex control panel standing between them.
>>

#### Andras
The result of one of **Thessalar**'s grand experiments, **Andras** has the body of a male human and the head of a massive snowy owl. Like that of any owl, his head can rotate almost fully around for 360-degree vision.

The prisoners are two of **Moghadam**'s thieves, who **Andras** is pressing for additional information as to their raid and **Moghadam**'s plans. However, the torturer is almost impossible to understand, with his speech resembling the hoots and clicks of an owl. Conversing with **Andras** requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check or a *speak with animals* spell, but the torturer speaks to the characters only in bold threats. In combat, **Andras** uses weapons coated in *blood of the lycanthrope poison* (see *appendix C*). He uses the **assassin** stat block with the following changes:

- He is neutral evil, and can speak and understand Common and Giant Owl.
- **Andras** has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or sight.
- The poison effect on his shortsword and light crossbow attacks is replaced with the following: If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with wererat lycanthropy.

**Andras** carries keys that open the concealed door leading to area 23.

#### Prisoners
Mack Francache, the neutral **wererat** leader of **Moghadam**'s thieves, is the unwilling subject of one of **Thessalar**'s sadistic experiments, conducted by **Andras**. His lycanthropic blood is being drained for study by **Thessalar**, who has already discovered ways in which it might be weaponized (see "Poisons" in *appendix C*).

The silver wires connect Francache to a lawful neutral female human **bandit captain** named Big Gadai (sister to the dead thief in area 6) and a normal rat. As **Andras** operates the controls to this strange torture device, he causes Francache's lycanthropy to transform the rat into a duplicate of Big Gadai, to the pain and horror of everyone involved. When the rat is in human form, it insists that it is the real Big Gadai, as does the real Big Gadai.

Francache bargains with the characters for his freedom, promising anything he can in return—including knowledge of the Tomb of Horrors. (His previous assignment for **Moghadam** was to spy on its workers while in rat form.)

#### Control Panel
The control panel is covered with dials, switches, and buttons—including a speckled gold button recognizable as one of the missing components of the *Infernal Machine*. Removing this component deactivates the controls and releases the restraints on the tables, freeing Francache, Big Gadai, and the rat.

Anyone attempting to disrupt the controls or the wires must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) force damage. The controls and the wires are self-repairing, and cannot be severed or destroyed.

#### Concealed Door
Located at the back of an empty iron maiden, this locked door leads to area 23, and is used by **Andras** to check on the clones there. It can be detected with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check. Without the key carried by **Andras**, its lock can be picked with a successful DC 18 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or it can be forced with a successful DC 18 Strength check.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes **Andras** to return to his quarters (area 8) to rest. If **Andras** and **Stolos** are both at this location, spending 3 charges results in both transforming back into their original forms—the human Andrastolos and his giant snowy owl companion. If restored to normal, Andrastolos uses **Andras**'s statistics but his alignment reverts to neutral. He is endlessly grateful to the characters, providing any information about the temple he can (he is familiar with areas 1 through 23), and offering to guide the party as needed.

### 10. Prison Cells
Characters entering this area can see activity through the open doorway to area 11, but can't make out any details until they advance. If the characters engage in any noisy or noticeable activity here (including advancing down the corridor with light sources), **Stolos** emerges from area 11 to investigate.

>>A long hallway leads past six cell doors, alternating three on each side. Five of the doors are constructed from iron bars, with the exception of what appears to be a glass door at the end.
>>

The doors to the cells are locked, and **Stolos** (in area 11) has the keys. They can also be unlocked with a successful DC 16 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or forced open from outside the cell with a successful DC 20 Strength check.

#### Prisoners
The cells are occupied as follows:

***10a.*** Three **lizardfolk** here are being punished for various transgressions. Mean-tempered and suspicious, they nonetheless offer information regarding the temple in exchange for their freedom, knowing their fate is otherwise horrible experimentation. They are likely to turn against the party at the first opportunity.

***10b.*** Two of **Moghadam**'s thieves (both lawful evil **spies**) are incarcerated here, one wounded and one near death, and both desperate to be freed. They are periodically taken out for interrogation in area 9, and are aware that experiments performed on them have created clones of themselves. They vehemently claim to be the real thieves.

The two join the characters if allowed, seeking to rescue and rejoin the other thieves to complete their original mission. Their evil nature inspires them to betray the characters if doing so works to their advantage.

***10c.*** This cell is currently empty.

***10d.*** This cell contains magically created duplicates of the thieves in 10b. They also claim to be the real thieves. (At your determination, these might be the real thieves, with the duplicates in 10b unaware of their true nature.)

***10e.*** Two **doppelgangers** are being held here for study and as eventual experimental subjects. They attempt to look like Mack Francache, **Seodra** the gemsmith, or anyone else they've seen pass through the cell area in order to escape.

***10f.*** This cell is sealed off behind a padlocked sheet of transparent glassteel—a resilient magical material as strong as metal—to prevent the escape of the **adult oblex** inside. The oblex can still use its Eat Memories action and Sulfurous Impersonation trait to create copies of anyone approaching too closely.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes one of the cell doors (chosen at random, excluding cell F) to rust with age and weaken. In this state, a door can be forced opened with a successful DC 10 Strength check from either side.

### 11. Office of the Warden
Adjust the following text if the characters attract **Stolos**'s attention as they approach this area.

>>The end of the cell hallway opens up to an office. A most unusual figure is seen behind a large desk strewn with papers—a huge white owl with the head of an aging man, seated atop a large, ornate bird stand. The figure reads while turning pages with a talon, muttering curses about, "That damned thumb-screwer, **Andras**."
>>

#### Stolos
The result of the same experiment that produced **Andras** (area 9), **Stolos** has the head of a male human atop the body of a giant snowy owl. He readily converses with the characters even if their initial appearance is suspicious, asking them friendly questions with the aim of discovering if **Moghadam** sent them.

If asked about his unusual appearance, **Stolos** angrily admits that he and **Andras** derived from a singular human subject and his giant snowy owl companion years before. The two hybrid creatures now have an intense hatred for one another, owing to a mutual disgust for their split nature.

**Stolos** offers to work with the characters if they harm or impede **Andras** (most easily by freeing the prisoners being tortured in area 9). His only real aim is for the characters to sow chaos before the temple's guards invariably deliver them back into his custody.

**Stolos** uses the **warlock of the Great Old One** stat block with the following changes:

- He is neutral evil.
- He has a flying speed of 30 feet.
- Replace his dagger attack with the following attack: ***Talons*.** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 8 (2d6 + 1) slashing damage.

**Stolos** carries the keys to the cells in area 10.

#### Treasure
A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check to search the desk uncovers a box of nine *paper birds* (see *appendix C*) used to send messages to **Thessalar**.

In addition, a locked strongbox can be found under the desk. It can be opened with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, but contains an easily noticed poison gas trap. A failed check triggers the trap, which sprays a dose of *dust of the mummy poison* (see *appendix C*) at the character making the check. The strongbox can be smashed open with a successful DC 20 Strength check, but doing so targets each character within 5 feet of the strongbox with *dust of the mummy poison*.

The strongbox holds the treasure collected from **Stolos**'s current prisoners—45 gp, 23 pp, ten small rubies (worth 25 gp each), a *ring of water walking*, and a vial of *blood of the lycanthrope antidote* (see *appendix C*).

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes **Stolos** to leave and check on the cells in area 10. If **Andras** and **Stolos** are both at this location, spending 3 charges results in both transforming back into their original forms. See area 9 for details.

### 12. Owl Laboratory
Whenever anyone enters this area, a huge cacophony of shrieks and hooting is raised from the animals kept here. The walls of the room are lined with cages filled with **owls**—one pair each of barn owls, horned owls, screech owls, and snowy owls. Against one wall, a huge cage holds a **giant owl**. In addition, several terrariums hold live mice, lizards, and small snakes used as food for the owls. Various cabinets hold prepared owl food, supplies, and implements for both the care and dissection of these creatures.

Any character who feeds the owls or succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check can successfully quiet them.

#### Barbatos
The neutral evil human ranger **Barbatos** is either here or in area 13 (a 50 percent chance for either; see *appendix B* for his stat block), accompanied by his **hell hound** companion, Sadie III. He carries keys to the cages in this area and area 13. Arrogant and cruel, **Barbatos** threatens and taunts the characters before attempting to capture them for **Thessalar**. If they prove too powerful, he flees and sets up hit-and-run ambushes for them as they continue to explore the temple.

A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check made while **Barbatos** is in combat identifies a number of silver wires connecting the ranger's cloak and backpack. If **Barbatos** is defeated, examining his body reveals that the backpack holds a troll's still-beating heart, while his cloak incorporates the feathery antennae of several rust monsters. The silver wires connect those living tissues to the ranger's own heart, providing his unique features. This setup is made permanently inoperable if **Barbatos** is slain.

Anyone attempting to disrupt the wires must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) force damage. The wires are self-repairing, and cannot be severed or destroyed.

#### Owls
If the owls are freed, they try to escape, flying out to area 1 and up the stairs. If **Barbatos** is still in the room when the owls escape, they attack him first.

A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check can convince at least one of the owls (of your choice) to remain with the party for the duration of the adventure. Feeding the owls first provides advantage on this check.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes all the cage doors to rust with age and weaken, allowing the owls to break free. There is a 50 percent chance that the giant owl also ages into an undead version of itself that attacks until destroyed. The **skeletal, rotted creature** uses the **giant owl** stat block with the following changes:

- It has the undead type instead of the beast type.
- It has vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.
- It is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, and is immune to exhaustion.

### 13. Bear Laboratory
Whenever anyone enters this area, a low growling rises from the animals kept here. A number of large, sturdy cages house one pair each of **black bears**, **brown bears**, and **polar bears**. In addition, shelves and cupboards throughout the room hold dried fish, dried berries, and grubs as food for the bears, along with tools and supplies.

Any character who feeds the bears or succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check can successfully quiet them.

#### Barbatos
The ranger **Barbatos** is either here or in area 12 (a 50 percent chance for either), accompanied by his **hell hound** companion, Sadie III. See *appendix B* for his stat block, and area 12 for more information.

#### Bears
If the bears are freed, they scatter throughout the temple, attacking anyone they see before eventually making their way to area 1 and up the stairs. If **Barbatos** is still in the room when the bears escape, they attack him first.

A character who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check can convince at least one of the bears (of your choice) to remain with the party for the duration of the adventure. Feeding the bears first provides advantage on this check.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes all the cage doors to rust with age and weaken, allowing the bears to break free. There is a 50 percent chance that both polar bears also age into undead versions of themselves that attack anyone in the room until destroyed. Each **skeletal, rotted bear** uses the **polar bear** stat block with the following changes:

- It has the undead type instead of the beast type.
- It has vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.
- It is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, and is immune to exhaustion.

### 14. Main Laboratory (North)
Depending on how they move through this area, the characters might see into area 16 at the same time. See that area for additional details.

>>A massive L-shaped laboratory space is filled with creatures strapped down to tables or chained to the floor, all attended to by lizardfolk workers. In this north wing of the lab, two tables hold terrified-looking fish-folk of some kind, connected by silver wires to other tables holding stoic-looking lizardfolk. More silver wires connect the tables to a complex control panel standing between them.
>>

The experiment underway in this area involves transferring and enhancing the amphibiousness of locathah prisoners to **Thessalar**'s loyal lizardfolk guards. (The artificer's aim is to establish a permanent population of lizardfolk in the underground lake to uncover more of the gems there.)

#### Creatures
Four **lizardfolk shamans** work here as lab managers, overseeing two **lizardfolk renders** connected to a pair of **locathah**. If attacked, the shamans release the renders to take on the characters, then one shaman flees to alert the rest of the laboratory section of the temple (areas 1 through 23).

If the locathah are freed, they attempt to flee for area 2, hoping to escape the temple via the river. However, a successful DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check can convince them to remain with the characters for the duration of the adventure, as long as they can access fresh water every 4 hours.

#### Control Panel
The control panel is covered with dials, switches, and buttons—including a cloudy orange button recognizable as one of the missing components of the *Infernal Machine*. Removing this component deactivates the controls and releases the restraints on the tables, freeing all the creatures in this area.

Anyone attempting to disrupt the controls or the wires must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) force damage. The controls and the wires are self-repairing, and cannot be severed or destroyed.

#### Treasure
Any search of the room finds two vials of *thessaltoxin poison* (see *appendix C*), whose polymorph capabilities are being used to facilitate the experiments here.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the lizardfolk renders on the tables to devolve back into standard **lizardfolk**.

### 15. Thessalar's Laboratory
Adjoining the main laboratory, **Thessalar**'s private lab is the site of the artificer's most challenging experiments.

>>Amazing instruments of complex design fill this laboratory, all seemingly engaged in active experimentation. Facing the doorway is a wooden desk, its legs resembling four small dryads whose outstretched hands are clasped together to support a desktop littered with thick tomes, alchemical vessels, and a complex control panel.
>>
>>An ancient male human sits behind the desk, with a homunculus perched on his shoulder.
>>
>>"More of **Moghadam**'s mercenaries, I presume?" the figure asks wearily. "I still haven't disposed of the last poor souls the so-called master of the tomb sent here." The homunculus then pulls the alchemist's face into an expression of wry contempt.
>>

#### Thessalar
The imperturbable artificer **Thessalar** readily converses with the characters, albeit with a domineering attitude. His starting assumption is that they've been sent by **Moghadam**, and he wants to learn as much about his rival's machinations as he can. See *appendix B* for his stat block.

![[010-cover-page.png|right|300]]

#### Grand Experiments
If the characters poke around the room while speaking with **Thessalar**, they can take in some of the experiments on display. These include the following, along with whatever other odd and wondrous examples you might think of:

- Orreries display unknown planets and various models of the planes.
- Glass piping connects tanks holding strange liquids and materials, all in an ongoing state of transmutation.
- A miniaturized human lies in apparent stasis in a windowed glass case.
- A vermiform pseudodragon twists and crawls about inside a large crystal tank.
- A colony of ants is constructing an elaborate city system in a huge glass tank—complete with an ant lion larva to which tiny insect victims are being sacrificed.

#### Thessalar's Bargain
**Thessalar** knows about the *Infernal Machine* components in the temple, and appears to entertain the notion of bargaining with the characters for them. In truth, he will never part with them as long as they fuel his experiments, and he looks to subvert any deal by eventually feeding the characters to the thessalkraken in the subterranean lake.

In exchange for the components in his possession, **Thessalar** proposes any of the following options:

- The characters can travel to the Tomb of Horrors (see *chapter 3*) to recover **Seodra**'s plans for crafting the jeweled skull of a demilich, as well as the remaining jeweled teeth (both in area 18a of the tomb). This will allow the captured gemsmith to complete the skull for **Thessalar** instead.
- The characters can instead travel to the tomb to either facilitate a prisoner exchange (offering **Seodra** for **Thessalar**'s missing sculptors), or to disrupt its construction by stealing **Moghadam**'s plans for the tomb.

The distance between the Temple of Moloch and the Tomb of Horrors is left to your determination, as are the details of the overland journey. If you don't want to play out that journey, the characters' mechanical guide can use its teleportation ability to take them to the tomb.

If the characters have already caused trouble in the temple, or if **Thessalar** suspects they will, he might just task them with the "easy challenge" of collecting gemstones from the temple's subterranean lake as replacements for the missing components—without mentioning the thessalkraken that dwells there.

#### Homunculus
Resembling an impish version of Moloch (complete with small ruby eyes worth 100 gp each), **Thessalar**'s homunculus assists with the artificer's experiments, and acts as a conduit for the complicated weave of magic in the Temple of Moloch. If the homunculus is destroyed, the eidolon in the main temple (area 25) must immediately use its Incorporeal Movement trait to enter the nearest available sacred statue, where it remains trapped. If no sacred statues are available, the eidolon is destroyed.

**Thessalar's homunculus** uses the normal stat block with the following change:

- The homunculus has the following additional attack option: ***Acidic Spittle*.** *Ranged Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. *Hit*: 5 (1d6 + 2) acid damage.

#### Control Panel
The control panel on the desk is covered with dials, switches, and buttons—including three emerald-green buttons recognizable as missing components from the *Infernal Machine*. Removing these missing components deactivates the controls and releases the **pseudodragon** and the ant swarm (use the **swarm of insects** stat block), which attack the nearest creatures until destroyed.

#### Treasure
The table is, in fact, crafted from four dryads, all subject to a diminution effect and subsequently petrified. If the characters have the ability to undo this state for all of them, the dryads are grateful to them. They promise a favor of your determination, then leave the temple for the nearby woods where they once dwelled.

If this area is searched, a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check uncovers research notes regarding **Thessalar**'s experiments, including his creation of the various thessalbeasts and the owlbear. The miniaturized human in stasis is described as a prototype phylactery, and is part of the artificer's research into lichdom. Other notes mention Nolzur's apprenticeship and the experiments with his blood (see area 7 of *chapter 3*) and how the silver wires can be used to attach the organs of creatures to other hosts (including **Barbatos** in areas 12 or 13, and the ettin in area 35).

In addition, this area contains *alchemist's supplies*, an *herbalism kit*, two vials each of *thessaltoxin poison* and *thessaltoxin antidote* (see *appendix C*), a box of ten *paper birds* (*appendix C*), and a strongbox containing three exceptional rubies worth 500 gp each.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area has no effect on **Thessalar** or his homunculus, but one of the experiments in the lab randomly advances as you determine. For example, using 1 charge might cause the pseudodragon to age into an undead pseudo-dracolich form, the miniature human to revert into a miniature baby that wakes from stasis and starts crying, and so forth.

### 16. Main Laboratory (South)
Depending on how they move through this area, the characters might see into area 14 at the same time. See that area for additional details.

>>A massive L-shaped laboratory space is filled with creatures strapped down to tables or chained to the floor, all attended to by lizardfolk workers. In this west wing of the lab, two owlbears are chained to the floor, connected by silver wires to a third creature that appears to be a two-headed owlbear. More silver wire connects their restraints to a complex control panel standing between them.
>>

The experiment underway in this area involves creating a two-headed owlbear by infusing an owlbear—a classic creation of **Thessalar**'s—with ettin's blood.

#### Creatures
Four **lizardfolk shamans** work here as lab managers, overseeing the process by which two **owlbears** are fueling the creation of a new creature—a **two-headed owlbear** nicknamed Bear-Bear (see *appendix B* for its stat block). If the lizardfolk shamans are attacked, they release the owlbears and the two-headed owlbear to take on the characters, then flee to alert the rest of the laboratory section of the temple (areas 1 through 23).

If the owlbears or their two-headed kin are freed, the cruel experiments performed on them have pushed them all to the breaking point. They ignore each other but attack any other creatures they can see.

#### Control Panel
The control panel is covered with dials, switches, and buttons—including a light-purple button recognizable as one of the missing components of the *Infernal Machine*. Removing this component deactivates the controls and releases the restraints on the tables, freeing all the creatures in this area.

Anyone attempting to disrupt the controls or the wires must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) force damage. The controls and the wires are self-repairing, and cannot be severed or destroyed.

#### Treasure
Any search of the room recovers two vials of *thessaltoxin poison* (see *appendix C*) and a vial labeled "Distilled Ettin Blood" (worth 25 gp to an alchemist), all used to facilitate the experiments here.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the owlbears' chains to rust with age and weaken, even as the owlbears age into undead versions, break free, and attack until destroyed. Each of the skeletal, rotted creatures uses the **skeletal owlbear** or **skeletal two-headed owlbear** stat block which includes the following changes:

- It has the undead type instead of the monstrosity type.
- It has vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.
- It is immune to poison damage and the poisoned condition, and is immune to exhaustion.

## Exploring the Temple (areas 17-24)

### 17. Midden
As the characters approach this area, a foul stench begins to rise. When the door is opened, read:

>>The stench from the chamber beyond the door delivers a punch like an angered demigod. The floor slopes toward an open pit at its center, and is covered in a layer of waste, blood, and viscera.
>>

The temple residents bring their refuse to this filthy chamber, including organic waste from the various laboratories. The foul debris here is ankle deep at the edges of the chamber, rising to knee deep closer to the center where the floor slopes toward the pit (area 18).

Upon entering this area, a character must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. Each character who moves across the floor must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity check or fall prone at the end of their move. If the check fails by 5 or more, the character slides 5 feet closer to the pit.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes a **lizardfolk** to appear here with a bucket of waste to dispose of. The lizardfolk ignores the characters, expecting that anyone hanging out in the midden must have some good reason to do so.

### 18. Disposal Pit
This open pit collects the waste thrown into the midden (area 17), where it feeds the **otyugh** that dwells in the pit. If any creature moves within 5 feet of the pit, the otyugh clambers out and attacks.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge within 5 feet of the pit evolves the otyugh into a **neo-otyugh**, which leaves the pit and attacks any creatures it can see. If the characters flee, the neo-otyugh begins to roam the temple, attacking all creatures as it looks to establish itself as the new ruler of the site.

### 19. Sitting Room
Serving as **Thessalar**'s private study, this area is richly furnished with ornate tables, chairs, and cabinets all carved from expensive stone. A fireplace along the west wall is carved to resemble a smaller version of the famed statue of Moloch in the main temple (area 25).

#### Treasure
With successful DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) checks made to search this area, the characters can uncover several items of interest:

- A vial of *thessaltoxin poison* (see *appendix C*)
- A tiny **mimic** in the shape of a jewelry box; the mimic deals half damage with its pseudopod and bite attacks, and has only 1 hit point
- Three rubies (worth 200 gp each)
- A piece of river crystal (400 gp)

In addition, designs can be found for **Thessalar**'s homunculus, indicating how it was crafted from a sliver of the statue of Moloch, and hinting that its destruction will disrupt the eidolon in area 25.

### 20. Thessalar's Bedroom
**Thessalar**'s private sleeping quarters are richly furnished with an ornate bed, chests filled with clothes, and other personal effects. A fireplace along the east wall resembles a smaller version of the famed statue of Moloch in the main temple (area 25).

#### Treasure
A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check made to search this area uncovers a key to the treasure vault in area 38 (set with a small ruby worth 20 gp). In addition, journal entries hint at **Thessalar**'s immunity to poison and his vulnerability to magic potions and salves that restore hit points.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes **Thessalar** to return here from his private lab (area 15) and prepare to rest. His homunculus remains in the lab to clean up experiments in progress, providing the characters with a window of opportunity to deal with it alone if they so choose.

### 21. Elite Guard Barracks
This damp chamber is filled with dry straw sleeping palettes, and houses the guards responsible for the protection of **Thessalar**'s apartments and laboratories.

#### Creatures
Three **lizardfolk renders** are stationed here. They attack any intruders to subdue them, then drag them before **Thessalar** in area 15.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area reverses time and causes the lizardfolk to head into the temple complex to search for **Moghadam**'s thieves, believing the thieves have just arrived. You determine where the guards might be encountered as a result.

### 22. Alchemical Lab

>>This laboratory space is filled with worktables holding tubing, glassware, and all manner of alchemical experiments. All the various experiments are connected by silver wires to a complex control panel.
>>

#### Control Panel
The control panel is covered with dials, switches, and buttons—including a hazy yellow button recognizable as one of the missing components of the *Infernal Machine*. Removing this component deactivates the controls and shuts down all the experiments underway here.

#### Treasure
Any search of this area recovers a set of *alchemist's supplies*, a set of *glassblower's tools*, and a set of *tinker's tools*. In addition, a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check identifies two vials of *thessaltoxin poison*, one vial of *blood of the lycanthrope antidote*, one vial of *mummy rot antidote*, and one vial of *thessaltoxin antidote*. See *appendix C* for all these items.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area advances the experiments underway here, producing three identical vials of liquid. One is water, one is a *potion of poison*, and one is a potion chosen by you.

### 23. Body Tanks
If the characters have met **Thessalar** already, they recognize the bodies in the tank as the artificer. Adjust the following read-aloud text accordingly:

>>This chamber holds a half-dozen floor-to-ceiling glass tanks, four of which are filled with a light-blue fluid in which the body of an elderly male human is suspended. Three of the bodies appear lifeless and inert. The fourth looks toward you and mouths silent words.
>>

**Thessalar** maintains several clones in tanks of preserving chemicals here, prepared by the spell of the same name and awaiting his use. Three clones are inert. The fourth has managed to gain a degree of sentience from its proximity to the magic of the missing components of the *Infernal Machine*, and mouths its demand to be set free. If freed, it claims to be the true **Thessalar** and that the artificer in area 15 is an impostor.

Any freed clone uses the same stat block as **Thessalar** (see *appendix C*) but lacks his special equipment and his homunculus.

#### Concealed Door
Located at the back of an empty tank, this locked door leads to area 9. It can be detected with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check. Without the key carried by **Andras**, its lock can be picked with a successful DC 18 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or it can be forced with a successful DC 18 Strength check.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 or more charges in this area causes one clone per charge to gain sentience, awaken, and demand to be set free. If all four are awakened, **Thessalar** arrives to investigate.

### 24. Halls of Statues
This series of long hallways are each lined with statues created by the temple's sculptors through the ages. Many depict Moloch, but other archdevils, demon lords, and former high priests of the temple are also represented. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Religion) check identifies any statue's specific subject, including several statues of Demogorgon, Asmodeus, Dagon, Bel, Zariel, Mammon, and Semuanya.

#### Sacred Statues
Ten of the statues in this area are large enough to serve as **sacred statues**. The **eidolon** in area 25 can enter and animate those statues as needed (see *appendix B*).

The sacred statues can be attacked to destroy them, preventing the eidolon from animating them. When not occupied by the eidolon, each statue has AC 17, 50 hit points, resistance to piercing and slashing damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A sacred statue is also vulnerable to the set of superior mason's tools found in area 11 of *chapter 3*. A character proficient with mason's tools can use the superior set to destroy a sacred statue with a successful DC 13 Dexterity check.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 or more charges in this area causes one sacred statue per charge to age and crumble to rubble, as long as the statue is not occupied by the eidolon.

## Exploring the Temple (areas 25-32)

### 25. Main Temple

>>The north end of this vaulted chamber is entirely filled by the temple's famed statue of Moloch. The impressive figure rises twenty-five feet high, nearly touching the ceiling. Its hands hold a massive burning brazier, illuminating the chamber with an eerie flickering glow. The brazier's fire reflects brightly within the facets of the statue's massive ruby eyes.
>>

#### Statue of Moloch
The eyes of the statue are the largest rubies ever recovered from the underground lake, and were cut and faceted by the temple's first priests. With a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check or a *detect magic* spell, a character discerns that the gem eyes are a focal point for the magic of the temple, and are magically connected to the various control panels making use of the missing components from the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad*. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check made to examine the gems reveals that they are connected to the statue with silver wires similar to those seen in **Thessalar**'s labs.

The gems can be removed with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. However, doing so deactivates any control panel still utilizing components from the *Infernal Machine* in the temple (in areas 9, 14, 15, 16, and 22). This disrupts the experiments and frees the bound creatures in all those areas.

The **eidolon** in this area (see below) can enter the statue to transform it into a **sacred statue**. The statue can be attacked to destroy it, preventing the eidolon from animating it. When not occupied by the eidolon, the statue has AC 17, 50 hit points, resistance to piercing and slashing damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The statue is also vulnerable to the set of superior mason's tools found in area 11 of *chapter 3*. A character proficient with mason's tools can use the superior set to destroy the statue with a successful DC 13 Dexterity check.

If the sacred statue is destroyed, the eidolon can enter one of the other appropriate statues in area 24.

#### Alcove
In the east wall, a narrow corridor leads to a tiny chapel room where the temple's first high priest communed with Moloch. After the priest's death, Moloch rewarded their faithful service by transforming him them into the **eidolon** that still resides here.

If the characters desecrate any part of the temple, including tampering with or examining the statue's gemstone eyes, the eidolon enters the sacred statue of Moloch and attacks.

#### Concealed Door
In the southeast corner of this area, a door concealed behind a tapestry leads to the guardroom (area 34). A fight between the characters and the eidolon (in or out of the sacred statue) is heard by the guards, who rush up to investigate.

#### Treasure
Notwithstanding their value to **Moghadam** and **Thessalar**, the statue's gemstone eyes are worth 5,000 gp each.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area forces the eidolon to either enter or leave the sacred statue. Doing so causes the eidolon to attack if it is not already in combat with the characters.

![[011-006.jpg|right|300]]

### 26. Workshop
The temple's sculptors labor in this workshop, which is filled with tables and benches covered in tools and raw materials for the crafting and repair of statuary.

#### Creatures
The five human sculptors here (use the **cultist** stat block) work feverishly to cover for the absence of the colleagues who left for the Tomb of Horrors. If the characters talk to them, the sculptors assume they were sent from the tomb as well, and ask about their missing colleagues. The sculptors share that **Thessalar** has captured the thieves sent out by **Moghadam**, including the gemsmith in area 31). They also know about the eidolon in area 25, and that this area of the temple is guarded by a two-headed giant called "the Demogorgon" (in area 35).

#### Treasure
In addition to ten rubies (worth 50 gp each) being worked into statues, this area contains two sets of *jeweler's tools* and *mason's tools*, as well as half a *manual of stone golems*. This is the torn matching half of the half manual held by the sculptors in area 11 of *chapter 3*. Even incomplete, it is worth 500 gp.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the sculptors to leave and return to their dormitory (area 33).

### 27. Workshop and Storage
This area holds a large kiln, which is constantly lit and used for the crafting of statues, homunculi, and other objects for the temple. Tools, chunks of stone, and lumps of clay wrapped in cloth are scattered about.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the homunculus in area 15 to return here (its place of origin).

### 28. Private Chapel
The temple's high priest resides in these small quarters, which contain a bed, personal effects, ceremonial robes, and religious instruments of office. A fireplace along the northeast wall is carved to resemble a smaller version of the famed statue of Moloch.

#### Alcoves
The larger alcove to the south of this area holds a pile of sacred stones for the construction of a powerful stone golem. This stone supposedly fell from Ogrémoch's body during the fight against Olhydra that carved out the first of the temple caverns. The smaller alcove holds the golem under construction. **Thessalar** hopes to recover his sculptors, their superior mason's tools, and their half of the *manual of stone golems* to complete this golem and send it out against **Moghadam**.

#### High Priest
Ard-Sagart (a lawful evil male human **warlock of the fiend**) is here when the characters arrive, praying before the fireplace. With the loss of the sculptors in **Thessalar**'s service, he believes the temple has lost favor with Moloch. To remedy this, he has requested more lizardfolk to brave the underwater lake and collect gemstones as tribute. He is preparing to bless the next volunteers.

#### Secret Door
A secret door to the underground lake is hidden within the fireplace, and can be detected with a successful DC 16 Wisdom (Perception) check. The image of the brazier held by the statue of Moloch is worked into the fireplace hearth. Two types of offering can be placed in this graven brazier—either a character's sacrifice of blood (represented by a self-inflicted wound that deals 5 piercing or slashing damage) or a gemstone of any value. Either offering is consumed when given, whereupon the fireplace flames magically lower and the secret door in the back of the fireplace opens.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the high priest to leave for area 29 by way of the secret door, then prepare for a ceremony of blessing.

### 29. Secret Equipment Room
Gear and equipment related to exploring the underground lake are stored in this private chapel to the temple's living demigod, the thessalkraken. Search and salvage gear are normally assigned to the lizardfolk charged with searching the subterranean lake for gems. Before entering the lake, the lizardfolk are blessed by the high priest in front of a smaller version of the statue of Moloch, modified to resemble the thessalkraken by having its arms changed into tentacles and its mouth filled with long needle-like teeth.

#### Treasure
In addition to mundane gear, this area contains a *folding boat*, a *helm of underwater action* (see *appendix C*), and an incomplete *apparatus of Kwalish*. The missing levers of the apparatus can be found in area 7, and require a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) check or a Dexterity check using thieves' tools or tinker's tools to reassemble.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes 1d4 **lizardfolk renders** to arrive for the priest's blessing before departing down the stairs to the underground lake (area 30). They attack unless they can be convinced the characters are part of the blessing ceremony.

### 30. Hidden Stairs
This winding set of stairs leads down to a natural cavern system below the temple. The main cavern is filled with a vast subterranean lake, fed by the stream at area 2. See "Underground Lake" at the end of this chapter for more information.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the thessalkraken to reveal itself as it breaks the surface of the water seeking food. Spending 2 charges also causes 1d4 **lizardfolk renders** to arrive, ready to brave the waters in search of gems. The lizardfolk take the appearance of the characters as a sign of offering, and attempt to force them into the water as sacrifices for their demigod.

### 31. Gemsmith's Cell
The oak door leading to this area is locked, but can be opened with a successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or forced open with a successful DC 14 Strength check. The chamber beyond holds the temple's most valued prisoner, **Seodra** the gemsmith.

>>This room contains a cot, a footlocker, a basin, and a worktable covered in various tools. The table is presently occupied by a female genasi, her skin encrusted with patches of faceted crystals. The project she's working on is a silver skull with jeweled teeth.
>>
>>Not bothering to look at you, the genasi says, "Your interruptions are not helping. For the last time, tell **Thessalar** I need more time to finish!"
>>

#### The Gemsmith
**Seodra** is an earth genasi from the Quasi-elemental Plane of Mineral. Sent by **Moghadam** to assist the thieves charged with stealing the gemstone eyes from the statue of Moloch in area 25, she was captured and put to work.

If the characters talk of rescuing her, **Seodra** refuses to leave unless they also promise to help her steal the statue's eyes. She takes her tools and the silver skull if the characters convince her to come with them. **Seodra** uses the **noble** stat block with the following changes:

- She has AC 19 (natural armor).
- She speaks Common and Primordial.
- She can move across difficult terrain made of stone without expending extra movement.
- She has the following trait: ***Treasure Sense*.** **Seodra** can pinpoint, by scent, the location of precious metals and stones, such as coins and gems, within 60 feet of her.

#### Treasure
The worktable contains the workings for the jeweled skull of a demilich: a solid silver skull (worth 2,000 gp) into which three diamonds (1,000 gp each) have been cut and set as teeth. **Thessalar** plans to use the skull for his own ascension to lichdom, either as his lich's phylactery or as the skull of a demilich.

**Seodra** possesses a set of superior *jeweler's tools*. These tools grant advantage when used to make an appropriate crafting check, and are worth 500 gp.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area taps into the ritual magic **Seodra** is using to craft the demilich's skull, causing a random character to age by one year. This effect can be reversed by casting a *remove curse* spell using a 6th-level spell slot.

### 32. Guardroom
Four **lizardfolk renders** are stationed here, assigned to watch over the gemsmith in area 31.

#### Corridor
The small corridor leading east across from the guardroom dead-ends at a point with several natural fissures in the floor (leading to the underground lake below), and is used as a privy.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the lizardfolk to head into the temple complex to search for **Moghadam**'s thieves, believing the thieves have just arrived. You determine where the guards might be encountered as a result.

## Exploring the Temple (areas 33-39)

### 33. Sculptors' Dormitory
This cramped dormitory holds bunks and simple furnishings for the fifteen sculptors originally living in the temple. Ten of those sculptors left the temple to work at the Tomb of Horrors, with only five remaining at work in area 26.

#### Belongings
A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check made to search this area uncovers a *figurine of wondrous power* hidden by one of the sculptors (choose any rare figurine). The figurine is wrapped in a crumpled invitation sent from **Moghadam** for employment at the Tomb of Horrors, promising exorbitant wages and offering a map showing the route to the temple.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the sculptors to leave their work in area 26 and return here to rest.

### 34. Guardroom
Four **lizardfolk shamans** are stationed here as temple guards. If they hear any sign of trouble along the corridor from area 25, they rush through the concealed doors to help defend the eidolon and the sacred statue there.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the lizardfolk to head into the temple complex to search for **Moghadam**'s thieves, believing the thieves have just arrived. You determine where the guards might be encountered as a result.

### 35. Office of the Demogorgon
This area houses an ettin, originally brought here for **Thessalar**'s experiments. The giant is kept both for his blood supply, which **Thessalar** uses in the crafting of new two-headed creatures, and as a guard for the treasure vault (area 38).

As the characters approach the entrance to this area, read:

>>A deep voice cries out through the open doorway ahead, quickly responded to by a second voice.
>>
>>"So! You come to honor Emmanuel, right head of the Demogorgon!"
>>
>>"No! You honor Hebediah, left head of Demogorgon!"
>>

When the characters can see into this area, read:

>>This filthy chamber is occupied by an ettin who is the source of the bellowing. The right head of the creature sports a stylish beard, while the left head has a large, curving mustache. Silver wires extend from a large pouch hanging around the giant's two necks, connecting directly into his chest. A pig snoozes on the floor at the ettin's feet.
>>
>>"Stand still!" one head roars. "My steward Slippy will present you for a formal audience."
>>
>>"No! My steward Sticky will present you!"
>>
>>Both heads then ignore you as they begin bellowing over one another for Slippy and Sticky to attend them.
>>

#### The Demogorgon
**This ettin** is thoroughly deranged, with **Thessalar** cruelly humoring the creature's condition in his "honored" treatment. See *appendix B* for **the ettin's** stat block. At one time, he was told that he was a statue of Demogorgon brought to life by **Thessalar**'s experiments. He has since come to believe that he is now the actual Demogorgon, with his two heads addressing one another as Aameul and Hathradiah—mispronounced as Emmanuel and Hebediah, respectively. A successful DC 14 Intelligence (History) check allows a character to recall the real names of Demogorgon's heads.

![[012-007.png|right|300]]

Much like the true Demogorgon, the ettin's two heads constantly clash and refuse to speak directly with one another, instead relaying messages through their assigned stewards (housed in areas 36 and 37).

If the ettin is defeated, examining the pouches around his necks reveals a collection of eyeballs and still-beating dragon hearts. The silver wires connect those living tissues to the ettin's own hearts, providing the creature's unique features. This setup is made permanently inoperable if the ettin is slain.

Anyone attempting to disrupt the wires must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) force damage. The wires are self-repairing, and cannot be severed or destroyed.

#### Alcoves
Various alcoves and side passages around this area hold a foul-smelling clutter of chickens, pigs, and goats kept behind wicker barricades, raised as food for the ettin. They are tended by the boggle who is steward to both the ettin's heads (see areas 36 and 37).

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the chickens to lay more eggs, to the delight of the ettin. Both his heads call out for their steward to gather the eggs at once.

### 36. Office of Hebediah's Steward
This office apartment houses the steward assigned to the ettin's left head (Hebediah). The room is meagerly furnished with a cot and a single chair, and connects to area 37 via a short hall hidden behind a poorly hung curtain. The tunnel is easily discovered with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.

#### "Slippy"
If not already met when summoned to area 35, there is a 50 percent chance that the steward to the ettin is found in this area. If not in this area, the boggle is in area 37.

This **boggle** was one of two caught trying to use their Dimensional Rift traits to reach into the temple's treasure vault (area 38). As punishment, they were assigned to provide care and grooming to the ettin's left and right heads, as well as relaying messages on the giant's behalf. When the ettin wants to talk to himself, one head gives the message to his steward, who runs off to deliver it to the other steward, who runs back to deliver it to the other head, and back down the line.

The two stewards are identical except for an epaulet worn on the left or right shoulder of their livery, but they have of late never been seen together. This is because only one boggle remains, the companion boggle having been disposed of in area 7. Both stewards are thus now the same creature, who works hard to make sure this is never discovered. The boggle intuits (correctly) that if the ettin were to uncover this secret, he would rip the boggle in half as a furious means of getting the proper number of stewards once more.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the steward to run back if they are elsewhere, or rush off to perform some task or deliver a muddled message to the ettin. In the course of doing so, they confuse matters such that their true nature as steward to both heads is accidentally revealed, incurring the ettin's wrath.

If 1 more charge is subsequently spent, things instead rewind and the ettin forgets all. The steward realizes they have been saved and is eternally grateful to the characters, helping them in any way possible.

### 37. Office of Emmanuel's Steward
This office apartment houses the steward assigned to the ettin's right head (Emmanuel). It is meagerly furnished with a cot and a small table, and connects to area 36 via a panel hidden behind a poorly hung curtain. The tunnel is easily discovered with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.

#### "Sticky"
If not already met when summoned to area 35, there is a 50 percent chance that the steward to the ettin is found in this area. If not in this area, the **boggle** is in area 36. See area 36 for details on the identity of Sticky and Slippy.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend charges in this area has the same effect as in area 36.

### 38. Treasure Vault
The wealth the temple has collected over centuries is stored in this hidden vault. Much of this wealth consists of gemstones gathered from the underground lake beyond areas 30 and 39.

#### Secret Door
The secret door leading into this area can be detected with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check, but is locked. Without the key (found in area 2 or area 20), the lock requires a successful DC 18 Dexterity check using thieves' tools to open, or it can be forced open with a successful DC 22 Strength check.

#### Treasure
Uncut rubies and other gems are piled and sorted here according to size—two hundred tiny stones (worth 10 gp each), one hundred small stones (25 gp each), twenty medium stones (100 gp each), and five large stones (200 gp each).

A small cask holds cut and polished rubies—fifty small gems (worth 100 gp each), ten medium gems (150 gp each), and five large gems (250 gp each).

In addition, five magic gems and stones are stored in individual coffers scattered about the room—an *elemental gem (earth)*, an *Ioun stone of vitality* (see *appendix C*), and three *spell gems* (see *appendix C*). Two of the spell gems are *lapis lazuli* holding *identify* and *unseen servant*. The third is a *quartz* holding *locate object*.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area either causes 1d4 of the largest uncut rubies to become cut and polished, doubling their value (a 50 percent chance), or causes the same number of the largest cut rubies to degrade back to raw stones, halving their value.

### 39. Stairs to Underground Lake
These twisting, turning stairs lead down to the underground lake that opens up beneath the temple complex.

### Underground Lake
The full details of the natural cavern system that opens up below the temple are left for you to design if desired. The main cavern, reached by the stairs at area 30 or 39, is filled by a subterranean lake fed by the stream at area 2.

When the characters descend the stairs at area 30 or area 39, read:

>>The stairs end abruptly, opening up to a vast natural cavern deep beneath the temple. A pebbly beach extends toward the dark waters of a subterranean lake that fills the cavern, a cold wind blowing across it.
>>

If the characters have light sources with them, anyone peering into the water notes a dull red gleam where a raw ruby sits at the bottom of the lake near the shore.

Any creature setting foot on the beach or entering the water must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity (Stealth) check or rouse the dread creature lurking within the lake.

#### Creature
One of **Thessalar**'s monstrous creations, the **thessalkraken** proved too dangerous to safely handle and was exiled to these caverns years ago. It has since grown too large to return to the temple, and now serves as a kind of living demigod to the cultists and lizardfolk serving **Thessalar**, who refer to it as the "Child of Moloch."

#### Treasure
Lizardfolk in service to **Thessalar** are sent here to brave the waters and attempt to recover more gemstones from the bottom of the lake. When the characters arrive here, the bottom of the lake is littered with 1d10 rubies. Roll a d10 to determine the value of each ruby found—

- 1–5: 10 gp
- 6–7: 25 gp
- 8–9: 100 gp
- 10: 200 gp

If all the rubies are claimed, it takes 24 hours for more rubies to appear in the lake.

The bottom of the lake is also covered with the cracked bones of the many creatures sacrificed to the thessalkraken, or who ran afoul of it while diving for gems.

#### Manipulating Time
Having a mechanical guide spend 1 charge in this area causes the thessalkraken to break the surface of the water seeking food, thus revealing itself. Spending 2 charges also causes 1d4 **lizardfolk renders** to arrive, ready to brave the waters in search of gemstones. The lizardfolk take the appearance of the characters as a sign of offering, and attempt to force them into the water as sacrifices for their demigod.
---
# Chapter 5: Final Showdown
After visiting the Tomb of Horrors or the Temple of Moloch (or both), the characters should have recovered some of the missing components of the *Infernal Machine*. Whenever they return to their original time, Lynx and **Sir Ursas** both make a play for the components, desiring to use them to complete and control the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad*.

## Special Delivery
Whichever agent the characters are working for, their mechanical guide is programmed to teleport them back to the agent's manor. If the characters somehow obtained both mechanical guides, they can decide which agent they want to initially return to. (Even if the characters have done secret deals with both agents, they should choose one to be their initial contact upon their return to their original time.)

If the characters somehow manage to return to their original time at any other location, a courier arrives at that location shortly thereafter, delivering an urgent invitation to come to the manor to discuss the results of their expedition. If the characters have the intent of avoiding the agent, the agent comes to find them in short order, and arranges for their mechanical guide to teleport everyone back to the manor.

### Formal Review
When the characters meet with their chosen agent, Lynx or **Sir Ursas** asks to inspect any missing components they've collected. The agent agrees to pay the characters as arranged, but only after their servants test that the components are in working order. The characters are then led to the agent's workshop. As they go, the agent talks about deducting expenses for any resources used, damage to the mechanical guide, and so forth—in general, becoming increasingly insidious.

## Completing the Machine
When the characters first see the workshop, they become aware of the scope of what the agent is hoping to achieve.

>>The entire workshop is filled with a massive magical-mechanical device, worked on by a half-dozen servants. With no visible means to move it, the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad* must presumably have the power to teleport itself from place to place. It appears ancient, the style of its crafting unlike anything you've ever seen before. It features some sixty levers, forty dials, and twenty massive switches, as well as a booth large enough to hold four humans—but whether those humans would be the machine's operators or the targets for its magic is unknown.
>>

When the components the characters collected are presented, the agent's assistants (six **cultists** in official-looking white lab coats) work quickly to install those components into the *Infernal Machine*. The mechanical guide that's accompanied the characters attaches itself to the machine, allowing it to serve as a command unit.

Another six **cultists** then appear with the agent's secret prisoner to finalize the programming.

>>A door on the far side of the workshop opens, and six more assistants stride forth with a weary-looking prisoner in tow. A human male with a haughty bearing, and wearing tattered, once-regal clothes, the figure gazes up at the great machine with a sense of recognition and longing.
>>
>>Your host laughs, gesturing toward the figure with a flourish. "Adventurers! May I present Lum the Mad!"
>>

### Lum the Mad
In response to any reaction or questions, the agent proudly explains how the partially functioning *Infernal Machine* was used to find and capture Lum the Mad, so that he could assist in restoring the machine to its primal state.

Lum uses the **warlord** stat block, but is unarmed and has no attacks while under guard. He possesses sufficient knowledge to program the *Infernal Machine*, allowing it to fully function according to its description now that the missing components have been restored. In his state of low-grade madness, Lum has no reason to not follow the agent's orders and help bring the machine online. However, he is also able to deactivate the machine, or even cause it to self-destruct—if the characters can convince him to do so with appropriate roleplaying or Charisma checks of your determination.

### Raid Against the Machine
Immediately after the missing components are installed and Lum is presented, the other agent launches a surprise raid against the first agent's manor. Read the following, adding details as appropriate depending on whether Lynx or **Sir Ursas** is the one coming for the *Infernal Machine*, and whether or not the characters have met the other agent:

>>A sudden shattering crash is heard as the wall of the workshop collapses to rubble! A fighting force advances through a cloud of dust, led by a most unusual-looking figure.
>>

The other agent arrives with a full complement of a dozen servants (use the **cultist** stat block).

During the raid, both agents attempt to attune to the *Infernal Machine*. You can decide which one is successful or allow chance to decide (see "Complications" below), taking into account the actions of the characters if they support one agent or the other.

During the fight, both agents shout out accusations that reveal the other's true natures. Those natures are then confirmed by the agents themselves. Any injury dealt to **Lynx Creatlach** shows the unnatural construction of her undead flesh and the rune-scribed skeleton beneath it. Any injury dealt to **Sir Ursas** causes him to shout out in rage, swearing vengeance "in the name of my unholy patron, Bel!"

If either agent gains control of the *Infernal Machine*, they immediately use it to attempt to defeat their rival. (The machine has all its normal functions except its *wish* ability, which will require additional programming.) If confronted by the characters, the agent turns the *Infernal Machine* against them. If the characters leave the agent in control of the machine, the agent departs with it to the Nine Hells when their rival has been dealt with.

### Complications
During the raid, any number of complications might arise. As desired, you can roll on the Machine Fight Complications table (see the next page) at the end of each round of combat, rerolling or ignoring results that have already occurred.

> ##### Failure Is an Option
>If the characters failed to recover a significant number of components from either site in the past—and assuming you don't want to send them back—you can work that into this final showdown. Whichever agent the characters return to is disappointed in their progress, but comes up with an alternative plan. Knowing that the other agent might also have sent their own operatives back to collect the missing components, the characters' agent invites them to help break into the rival agent's workshop to steal those components from the rival's version of the *Infernal Machine*. Reverse the general setup of this section to have the characters on the side that breaks into the workshop. There, they see the rival agent holding Lum the Mad, and in the process of completing the *Infernal Machine*.
>

##### Machine Fight Complications
| d100 | Result |
|:---:|---|
| 01–15 | Lynx attunes to the *Infernal Machine* and begins to use its powers. |
| 16–30 | 2d8 secret operatives of the city guard (use the **spy** stat block) have been watching one or both agents, and show up to attempt to stop the fight. |
| 31–45 | Lum is threatened by cultists of one agent or the other. If aided, he agrees to work with the characters in whatever fashion they desire. |
| 46–55 | The *Infernal Machine* comes to life, summoning a CR 5 monster (your choice) that attacks the creatures closest to it. |
| 56–65 | The *Infernal Machine* comes to life, summoning a CR 10 monster (your choice) that attacks the creatures closest to it. |
| 66–70 | A spellcaster fighting for Lynx casts a *lightning bolt* that streaks across the battlefield to strike targets as you determine. |
| 71–75 | A spellcaster fighting for **Sir Ursas** casts a *fireball* that explodes at a location of your determination. |
| 76–80 | Lynx slays **Sir Ursas**. She cuts off his bear paw, promising to turn it into her personal backscratcher. |
| 81–85 | **Sir Ursas** slays Lynx. He tears her flesh golem suit away to reveal the skeleton within, which he then shatters. Lynx's skull might still remain animated and conversational. |
| 86–90 | Both Lynx and **Sir Ursas** manage to slay one another simultaneously. |
| 91–00 | Both Lynx and **Sir Ursas** decide that events have grown too heated and escape into the city. High bounties are set for their capture. |

## Concluding the Adventure
Depending on the hook you used and how this adventure fits into your overall campaign, a number of things can happen at the end of *Infernal Machine Rebuild*.

### Nine Hells or Bust
If either agent is successful in taking the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad* to the Nine Hells, it changes the balance of power in Avernus. Either Zariel is able to solidify her rule of that level, or Bel is able to reclaim the level using the machine's power. What happens as a result is entirely up to you, and might come into play if you are running *Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus* as part of your campaign.

> ##### Finders Keepers
>If the characters plan on keeping the missing *Infernal Machine* components for themselves, for delivery to another patron (such as Kwalish), or simply to keep them out of the hands of the agents, both Lynx and **Sir Ursas** launch separate attacks to recover them. These attacks can either be spaced out to avoid overwhelming the characters, or you can have both agents attack at the same time and largely concentrate on each other.
>

### Our Infernal Machine
If one or both of Lynx and **Sir Ursas** are defeated, the characters might end up in possession of the *Infernal Machine*. If you opt to keep this powerful artifact in your campaign, see *appendix C* for its statistics. Otherwise, you can decide that the machine has been fatally programmed to disperse its components to all-new locations—but only after the characters have had a bit of time to experiment with it.

Of course, if the characters take possession of the machine for any length of time, any surviving agents seek revenge against them. Likewise, so will the agents' patron archdevils, Zariel and Bel, who might send forces of cultists to finish the characters off.

### Mechanical Guides
The mechanical guides are programmed to serve their agent masters—and to self-destruct in the event that anyone else attempts to take control of them. Still, exposure to the power of the components of the *Infernal Machine* might change a guide's programming, allowing the characters to befriend and permanently claim it as a companion or ally. If this happens, a guide's time traveling ability can be curtailed as you desire.

### The Joys of Time Travel
Because this adventure traverses both time and space, you might decide that actions carried out by the characters in the past of chapters 3 and 4 create changes in the present of the campaign world when they return. For example, the construction of the Tomb of Horrors might be disrupted, in which case it holds less prominence in later times. If **Thessalar** regains his missing sculptors, he might complete his stone golem and send it out to destroy **Moghadam** and demolish the tomb while it's under construction. **Thessalar** might also create more monsters than he is already known for, which can spread throughout the world.

Feel free to keep track of what events and choices in the past might have future implications—and have fun presenting the fallout of those events to your players!

# Appendix A: Further Options
*Infernal Machine Rebuild* hopefully provides plenty of options for you to run the adventure the way that works best for your campaign. But if you'd like to customize this adventure even further, consider any of the following possibilities.

## Chapter 1: The Unicorn and the Hags
The conflict between the hags and the unicorn Banrion can be complicated or augmented in a number of ways.

### Clandestine Hags
If having three dryads working together is too immediate a tipoff that these might be hags forming a coven, you can add a fourth illusory mother to the mix to help allay suspicion. Created from a few logs and branches, Mother Hedgehog sits quietly in the corner of the cottage. If the characters attempt to speak with her, the programmed illusion is able to mumble a few incoherent words. A successful DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check detects this illusion.

The hags' cottage is built from three trees entwined together. These trees might contain the three true dryads whose appearances the hags have stolen for their own use, and who have been enslaved by the hags to help with their corrupt gardening. If the characters treat with Banrion, the unicorn asks them to help free the dryads to set the woods back to order. 

Instead of the hags being disguised as goodly dryads, you might instead choose to reverse the scenario. The Three Mothers might really be dryads in need of help, with Banrion the unicorn an evil creature that must be defeated to save the woods. The unicorn might even be using its dark magic to cause the dryads to appear as hags.

### Unicorn Showdown
If the characters initially make an aggressive approach toward Banrion (whether because the hags have fooled them or because the unicorn is evil), you can make the fight tougher by having the unicorn appear while the characters are attempting to cross the clock tower bridge. While fighting on the bridge, Banrion looks to knock characters off the tower into the chasm below, or even to try to collapse the tower under the characters while she teleports away.

If the unicorn later makes peace with the characters, she teleports down into the chasm (if still able to) and heals them.

## Chapter 2: An Invitation Extended
Meeting with the infernal agents has the potential for a number of interesting story options.

### Updated Guides
As written, the mechanical guides can safely teleport the characters to and from the specific adventure locations. If it fits with your campaign, you might opt to allow teleportation to other locations in time and space with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. A failed check causes the characters to be misdirected physically or temporally, as you determine. If the characters claim any missing components of the *Infernal Machine*, those components can be added to the mechanical guide, providing a +2 bonus to this check per component.

You might decide that neither agent would ever allow the components they already possess to leave their sight, or that the characters are the first ones to have come across any missing components. If so, Lynx's guide is powered by a dangerous combination of living *teleport* and *time stop* spells, and might malfunction as you see fit. **Sir Ursas**'s guide is a captured quarut (an inevitable that seeks to uphold the laws of space and time), and which is forced to use its powers as Ursas demands. Though the quarut is programmed to prevent it from revealing its plight outright, it might provide clues during the adventure that all is not as it seems.

### Healthy Competition
When the characters make their choice of which agent they want to work with, whatever agent they turn down immediately arranges to send out their own competing expedition. (If the characters agree to work for both agents, both agents might still send out second redundant expeditions as insurance.)

These expeditions are composed of five **cultist** servants, led either by the **enhanced medusa** for Lynx, or the brains in iron for **Sir Ursas** (see below for more information on both). Each expedition also has its own mechanical guide. You might use the members of the rival expedition to chase after the characters, or they might have already arrived at one of the locations and be set up for the characters to stumble upon. The members of the alternative expedition might set obstacles along the way, possibly inspiring the characters to do the same. Using the power of a mechanical guide might allow for the creation of particularly devious traps that can be set across space and time. And the members of the alternative expedition certainly look to sabotage or destroy the characters' mechanical guide in order to strand them.

These competitors might succeed in securing some of the missing components, whether they steal them out from under the characters or take them directly in combat. Any stolen components will be delivered to their respective agents before the characters return from the past.

### Enhanced Medusa
Like the enhanced sphinx from *Lost Laboratory of Kwalish*, this creature has been augmented with various technologies from the Barrier Peaks. Specifically, its eyes have been replaced with mechanical frames into which it slots different lenses. This is the same magical technology that was used to create another artifact, *Daoud's Wondrous Lanthorn*. The medusa is nicknamed "Daoud's Living Lanthorn" as a result.

The **enhanced medusa** uses the **medusa** stat block with the following changes:

- It has truesight out to a range of 60 feet.
- It can cast the *light* cantrip at will.
- Its Petrifying Gaze trait turns creatures into metal, wood, or porcelain (the medusa's choice) rather than stone.

If this adventure is played as a sequel to *Lost Laboratory of Kwalish*, the **enhanced medusa** might seek revenge for what befell its ancestor **Gloine Nathair-Nathair**, or could be appeased with information regarding that medusa's whereabouts.

> ##### Who's Who
>While little is known of Daoud, his lanthorn was part of the treasure to be recovered in the AD&D adventure module *Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth*. Light cast through the different faces of the lanthorn created different magical effects, which the lanthorn fueled with crushed gemstones.
>

### Brains in Iron (The Council)
This creature originated from old designs of Kwalish, and takes the form of multiple brains that have been magically preserved and which collectively operate a new mechanical body. The brains share insights and knowledge with one another, and have typically been taken from creatures that desired to prolong their consciousness—or that were tasked with controlling a construct for all time as punishment.

A **brain in iron** uses the **brain in a jar** stat block with the following changes:

- It is lawful neutral.
- It has the construct type.
- Its size is Large.
- It has Armor Class 15 (natural armor).
- It has a speed of 20 feet.

If this adventure is played as a sequel to *Lost Laboratory of Kwalish*, this creature began as the brains in jars encountered in the Barrier Peaks. After constructing a new collective body from spare parts, the brains escaped (and now seek revenge against the characters if they did not aid the brains sufficiently during that adventure). The brains' collective goal in seeking the missing components is to be able to transfer themselves into the ultimate mechanical body—the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad*.

## Chapter 3: Construction of Horrors
You can expand the characters' exploration of the Tomb of Horrors construction site in a number of ways.

### Hanging with Moghadam
Even villains have their hobbies—and for **Moghadam**, that hobby is death traps. Any character who discusses traps with **Moghadam** can impart to him a new deadly design—either using suitable roleplaying and player ingenuity, or a successful DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Doing so gains **Moghadam**'s favor and advantage on further ability checks made to negotiate with the artificer, as you determine.

### Muralist Mutiny
As written, the sculptors in the Tomb of Horrors are eager to escape but the muralists are loyal to **Moghadam**. However, you might decide that the muralists have their own reasons to flee servitude, and have secured a set of *claws of the umber hulk* (see *appendix C*) to do so. They might also look for the characters' help to escape, using the claws to dig a secret tunnel beneath their chambers in area 9—and potentially intersecting with the umber hulks' excavations.

### Rock and Ruin
As an added element of danger and dilemma during the ceremony in the chapel (area 14), each time a character succeeds on a saving throw to resist the ceremony's power, one of the worshipers in the pews is overcome and transforms into black rock.

If the black rocks from the chapel are brought to the sculptors, you might decide that they can help restore those victims to life using their superior mason's tools. Alternatively, the sculptors might want to incorporate these magic rocks into an even more impressive golem, helping to ensure their escape. Likewise, if taken to the Temple of Moloch, these rocks might be highly prized for the crafting of statues and homunculi.

### Go to Hell
The fiery rift of area 16 allows **Tarnhem** to return to the Abyss. But depending on the setup of your campaign (and particularly if you are playing through *Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus*), you might instead have this rift lead to the Nine Hells. There, **Tarnhem** joins the demonic horde taking part in the Blood War.

If the characters later travel through Avernus, they might encounter **Tarnhem** there—with his reaction to them depending on their interactions at the tomb.

## Chapter 4: Temple of Moloch
The level of chaos and creative power on display in the Temple of Moloch lends itself to a number of play options.

### Trade Talk
**Thessalar**'s fixation on monster design provides an opportunity for bonding with any character with insight into that topic—or who can fake it well enough, either using suitable roleplaying and player ingenuity, or a successful DC 16 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Suggesting a new design for a magical creature (ideally one combining the aspects of two or more existing creatures in some particularly deadly way) can grant advantage on checks made to interact with the artificer.

### Tressym Patrol
Considering the variety of laboratory creatures residing in the temple, its hallways might also be populated by roving packs of wild, escaped **tressym**. These flying cats follow and spy on the characters, but might help lead them to various locations (such as the secret door outside area 38) if treated well. The tressym despise **Barbatos**'s **hell hound** (areas 12 and 13), and actively aid any effort to destroy it.

### Mixing up the Thieves
If the characters pass through the village mentioned in the "Temple Approach" section, they might discover that one of the villagers is one of Mack Francache's thieves, left behind to keep an eye on activities outside the temple. When the characters arrive, this thief presents themself as a seemingly reluctant guide willing to join the characters on the incursion into the temple. While there, they secretly try to direct the characters toward rescuing the imprisoned thieves.

Mack Francache the wererat prisoner (area 9) might instead be a lycanthrope of some kind never seen before: a weremouse, a weremoose, or even a wereooze. **Thessalar** is extremely interested in studying this new lycanthropy. Alternatively, Mack might have been a normal human when he came to the temple, only to have **Thessalar** impose this strange lycanthropy upon him.

### Statuesque
You might introduce different options for interacting with the statues in area 24, especially if combat breaks out there. For example, if the eidolon inhabits a statue of Zariel or Bel, the characters might gain advantage on attack rolls against that statue if they serve the archdevil's agent (or disadvantage on attack rolls against the statue of the competing agent's patron). Out of combat, if the characters are allied with **Moghadam** and remove a hand and an eye from any statue, Vecna rewards them with some boon (advantage on attack rolls during the first round of their next fight, having a consumable magic item appear in the statue's remaining hand, and so forth).

### Secret Chicken
One of the chickens in area 35 might be one of **Thessalar**'s experiments, such that it occasionally lays silver eggs (worth 10 gp) or even golden eggs (worth 20 gp). In this scenario, both boggles originally came to the temple to steal this chicken. Or this might just be a tale the remaining boggle tells, planting false eggs with the chickens in order to better negotiate with the characters.

## Chapter 5: Final Showdown
The presence of a legendary artifact in the final chapter of the adventure opens up lots of possibilities.

### An Infernal War Machine
For deeper integration with *Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus*, an alternative climax could have the characters' chosen agent complete their version of the *Infernal Machine*—which is then converted into an infernal war machine. Such a process might involve drawing on other elements of the adventure's locations (the Tomb of Horrors' still-to-be-built stone juggernaut, the skeleton of the thessalkraken, and so forth) for use in the war machine's chassis.

The characters are then asked to drive the war machine into Avernus, to confront the minions of the archdevil opposed by their agent and thwart that archdevil's plans. Alternatively, the *Infernal War Machine* might be teleported to the Nine Hells, where the characters later encounter it during the course of *Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus* and are required to stop it.

### A Mighty Servant
When the characters deliver the missing components to their chosen agent and the other agent launches a raid, that raid is led by a second artifact that the agent has been constructing—the *Mighty Servant of Leuk-O*. Alternatively, if Kwalish is involved, he might build or upgrade a suit of *powered armor* (from *Lost Laboratory of Kwalish*) to become the *Mighty Servant of Leuk-O*. The characters can then use that artifact (with features determined by you) to counter the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad*.

## Additional Locations
You can turn this adventure into an entire campaign by adding additional locations containing more missing components of the *Infernal Machine*. Just as the Tomb of Horrors was repurposed here, you might similarly repurpose other adventures from D&D history or your previous campaigns, manipulating their time lines to create alternative scenarios.

So many of the iconic locations in D&D would make great additions to this adventure, from the tower of Sorcere in Menzoberranzan, to one of the elemental nodes in *Princes of the Apocalypse*, to the level of Dweomercore in *Dungeon of the Mad Mage*, to Skyreach Castle in *Hoard of the Dragon Queen*. A few specific examples are presented here.

### Tomb of Annihilation
Missing components could be hidden in any number of locations in the jungles of Chult, including the Lost City of Omu, or even integrated into the Tomb of the Nine Gods. For example, to recover a component located at the City of Omu's amphitheater, the characters might need to overcome the King of Feathers at some point in the past (making it a younger, weaker tyrannosaurus rex) or the future (where it has become a deadly dinosaur zombie).

### Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl
Missing components could be hidden throughout many areas of this adventure from Tales from the Yawning Portal. In the caverns of area 5, components could be buried within the ice in a way that requires the characters to access them in the past—and allowing the creatures trapped in the ice to be brought back to life. In the visitors' cave of area 26, components might have been brought as special gifts by past dignitaries unaware of their true nature. And in the snow-covered dome of area 28, they might be guarded as treasure by the **remorhaz**.

### White Plume Mountain
The characters might need to travel back to a time when Keraptis first constructed his legendary dungeon (featured in *Tales from the Yawning Portal*), and used components from the *Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad* to magically secure *Wave*, *Whelm*, and *Blackrazor* in place. Alternatively, he might trade missing components in his possession for the three famed weapons, which are still hidden elsewhere in the world, or for some of the monstrous creatures that will eventually guard the dungeon.

If you are playing this adventure alongside *Lost Laboratory of Kwalish*, *White Plume Mountain* offers a number of connections to that adventure's guides. Ctenmiir the vampire once haunted White Plume Mountain, while Mary Greymalkin's former tutor, the witch Thingizzard, dwelled nearby.

## Additional NPCs
To let the characters dig even deeper into the world of the adventure, you can also consider adding a few more iconic NPCs.

### Acererak
During the time frame in which the characters visit the Tomb of Horrors, Acererak is still a mortal human spellcaster—albeit an incredibly evil and powerful one. You can play him as an **archmage**—or for higher-level parties, use his stat block from *Tomb of Annihilation*, but without his undead traits, his Rejuvenation and Turn Resistance traits, and his Disrupt Life legendary action. Acererak does not reside in the Tomb of Horrors at the time the characters travel there in chapter 3, but he might appear if its construction is hindered. He is keen on preventing characters from utterly destroying the tomb, but might grace them with an audience if they look as though they could prove useful to furthering his plans.

If enmity arises between the characters and Acererak, the would-be lich is a formidable foe. You might make this special version of Acererak even more so by having him wielding a sword with a *sphere of annihilation* fashioned into its blade, and with the matching *talisman of the sphere* fashioned into the hilt.

### Mary Greymalkin
A potential guide in *Lost Laboratory of Kwalish*, Mary Greymalkin might appear in this adventure as a servant of **Moghadam** or **Thessalar**, a guide for the thieves who entered the Temple of Moloch, one of either agents' couriers, and so forth. As she does in *Lost Laboratory of Kwalish*, she offers to let the characters draw from her *deck of several things*. Some of the deck's cards bestow effects more relevant to this adventure, as follows:

***Donjon.*** You are instantly teleported to and confined within either the Tomb of Horrors (in area 7) or the Temple of Moloch (in area 10) as the DM determines. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You draw no more cards.

***Flames.*** A powerful artificer (**Moghadam** or **Thessalar**, at the DM's determination) becomes your enemy. The artificer seeks your ruin, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you.

***Gem.*** One of the 1,000 gp gems shaped by **Seodra** the gemsmith (see area 18a of chapter 3 or area 31 of chapter 4) appears at your feet. If all those gems are unavailable, you gain an equivalent hoard.

***Knight.*** You gain the service of one of the servants of your chosen agent (see *chapter 2*), who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The NPC serves you loyally for the duration of the adventure, understanding that the fates have drawn them to you. However, they remain violently opposed to any servants of the opposing agent. You control this character.

***Ruin.*** All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. This wealth can be recovered either in the Tomb of Horrors (held by **Moghadam** in area 1) or the Temple of Moloch (locked in the treasure vault, area 38), as the DM determines.

***Talons.*** Every magic item you wear or carry is lost to you. These items can be recovered either in the Tomb of Horrors (held by **Moghadam** in area 1) or the Temple of Moloch (locked in the treasure vault, area 38), as the DM determines.

***Throne.*** You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill and you double your proficiency bonus for checks made with that skill for the duration of the adventure. In addition, the Temple of Moloch's high priest regards you as the temple's new champion, sent by Moloch to reclaim its former glory. You must defeat or otherwise clear out **Thessalar** before you can claim the temple as yours.

***The Void.*** This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and held within a soul gem in the Temple of Moloch (with the gemsmith in area 31). While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. *Divination*, *contact other plane*, or a similar spell of 4th level or higher reveals the location of the soul gem. You draw no more cards.

### Tuerny the Merciless
This lawful evil male human **archmage** is no longer at the Tomb of Horrors, but contributed to the construction in his own way. Acererak hired Tuerny to install magical technology obtained from the Barrier Peaks into the tomb (including the missing components), which now hold **Tarnhem** imprisoned here and drain his life force. Since leaving the tomb, Tuerny has used what he learned in crafting **Tarnhem**'s prison to create the first of his fabled *iron flasks*]. If the characters choose to stay in the time frame of the under-construction tomb, they might find a map leading to Tuerny's fortress.
