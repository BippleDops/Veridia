# Chains of Carceri
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 110. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span>*  

**Prerequisite**: Level 15, Pact of the Chain

You can cast [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/hold-monster-xphb|hold monster]] at will—targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental—without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again.
