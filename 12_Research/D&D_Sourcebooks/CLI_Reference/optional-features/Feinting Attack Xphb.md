# Feinting Attack
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 95*  

As a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]], you can expend one Superiority Die to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of yourself as your target. You have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on your next attack roll against that target this turn. If that attack hits, add the Superiority Die to the attack's damage roll.
