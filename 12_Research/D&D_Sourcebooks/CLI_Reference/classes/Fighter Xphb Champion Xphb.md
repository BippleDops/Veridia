Champions combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows, withstand peril, and garner glory. Whether in athletic contests or bloody battle, Champions strive for the crown of the victor. ### Improved Critical (Level 3) Your attack rolls with weapons and Unarmed Strikes can score a [[Critical Hit Xphb]] on a roll of 19 or 20 on the`d20`. ### Remarkable Athlete (Level 3) Thanks to your athleticism, you have [[Advantage Xphb]] on [[Initiative Xphb]] rolls and Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) checks. In addition, immediately after you score a [[Critical Hit Xphb]], you can move up to half your [[Fly Speed Xphb]] without provoking [[actions#Opportunity%20Attack|Opportunity Attacks]]. ### Additional Fighting Style (Level 7) You gain another Fighting Style feat of your choice. ### Heroic Warrior (Level 10) The thrill of battle drives you toward victory. During combat, you can give yourself [[heroic-inspiration-xphb (variant-rules)]] whenever you start your turn without it. ### Superior Critical (Level 15) Your attack rolls with weapons and Unarmed Strikes can now score a [[Critical Hit Xphb]] on a roll of 18â€“20 on the`d20`. ### Survivor (Level 18) You attain the pinnacle of resilience in battle, giving you these benefits. #### Defy Death You have [[Advantage Xphb]] on Death Saving Throws. Moreover, when you roll 18â€“20 on a [[Death Saving Throw Xphb]], you gain the benefit of rolling a 20 on it. #### Heroic Rally At the start of each of your turns, you regain [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] equal to 5 plus your Constitution modifier if you are [[bloodied-xphb (variant-rules)]] and have at least 1 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]]. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Fighter xphb champion xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
