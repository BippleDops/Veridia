[[owtqyyuq.vee.png|open outside]]

## Special Traits
**Bleeding Wound:** A creature takes `dice: 1d4` necrotic damage at the start of its turn from each bleeding wound it has. A creature with one or more bleeding wounds makes a DC 15 Con saving throw at the end of its turn; all wounds stop bleeding on a success. All bleeding is also stopped if the wounded creature or an ally within 5 feet uses an action to make a successful DC 15 Wis (Medicine) check.

**Dislocated:** The gloam’s form is made up of its memories, which shift and change. The creature is continually under the effect of a blur spell (attacks against it are made with tactical disadvantage unless the attacker has blindsight, truesight, or an equivalent). The gloam can suppress or reactivate this ability at will as a bonus action.

**Distorted:** The gloam’s internal anatomy varies from individual to individual and seldom makes any biological sense. Critical hits against a gloam do a flat +1 damage but don’t roll damage dice twice.

**Fear Gaze:** A creature that sees the gloam’s face within 30 feet must make a successful DC 17 Wis saving throw or be frightened of the gloam for 1 minute. While frightened, the creature is also stunned; it can only cower in fear. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself with a success.

**Magic Resistance (1/day):** When the gloam fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Regeneration:** A gloam heals 10 hit points at the start of each of its turns. This ability doesn’t function if it took radiant damage since its previous turn.

**Sneak Attack:** A gloam’s attack does an extra `dice: 3d6` damage if the gloam has advantage on the attack.

**Spell-like Abilities:** The gloam can use the following spell-like abilities, using Charisma as its casting ability (DC 13, attack +5). The gloam doesn’t need material components to use these abilities.

*At will:* misty step (can’t teleport to or from bright light)

*1/day each:* dimension door, invisibility (self only, duration 1 minute)

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The gloam bites once and claws twice, or attacks three times with mirror shards.

**Melee Attack—Bite:** +9 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d6 + 5` piercing damage, and the creature suffers a bleeding wound (see below).

**Melee Attack—Claws:** +9 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d8 + 5` slashing damage, and the creature suffers a bleeding wound (see below).

**Ranged Attack—Mirror Shards:** +9 to hit (range 60 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d6 + 5` slashing damage, and the creature suffers a bleeding wound (see below).

## Description
**Environment**: Urban (Between)

**Organization**: Solitary

A gloam embodies the paralyzing terror of the unknown “thing in the darkness” combined with a stalking murderer. It is an emotionless entity composed of alien flesh and shadow that steps from Between to terrorize communities with serial killings. Its imaginative dismemberment and placing of it victims’ bodies conveys the horror they experienced when they encountered it and the fear that ripples outward from a gloam’s presence in the mundane world.

Unlike many [[Appendix A - Between Creatures|Between creatures]] that are born elsewhere and transported to Between, indications are that the gloam is a native of that realm. Its teeth and claws are razor-sharp shards of mirrors, and it can conjure additional mirror shards at will to throw or spit like darts or shuriken.
