- -- ### Session Overview **Date:** March 15th, 2024 **Duration:** 4 hours **Present:** All 5 players **Location:** Convergence Point Station **Session Type:** Investigation & Mystery ### The Story So Far Our adventure began at the bustling Convergence Point Station, where representatives from both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor conduct cross-realm business. The party had gathered as independent investigators hired by the Cross-Realm Merchant's Guild to look into a series of mysterious disappearances affecting both realms. #### The Briefing Guildmaster **Aurelia Goldcurrent** (a shrewd mer-folk with obvious political connections) explained that three prominent merchants had vanished in the past month:
- **Captain Windwright** (Aethermoor sky-ship captain)
- **Depth-Merchant Corallion** (Aquabyssos pearl trader)
- **Ambassador Tidecaller** (Cross-realm diplomatic courier) Each disappeared while conducting routine business at the Convergence Point, with no signs of struggle or obvious motive. #### Investigation Begins The party split up to gather information: **Kestra** (our Crystal Singer Bard) used her connections in the entertainment district to learn that all three victims had been seen frequenting *The Pressure Drop Tavern* in the days before their disappearances. **Marcus** (Depth Walker Ranger) examined the victims' last known locations and discovered traces of an unusual crystalline residue - not quite corruption, but definitely unnatural. **Lyralei** (Storm Caller Druid) investigated the environmental conditions and found that the local weather patterns had been subtly manipulated around the times of each disappearance. **Thane** (Reality Anchor Paladin) questioned the station guards and learned that each victim had received a mysterious package the day before vanishing. **Serafina** (Shadow Surgeon Rogue) - in typical fashion - broke into the victims' quarters and discovered that each had been researching something called "The Void Merchants" in private. #### The Pressure Drop Tavern The party reconvened at the tavern, a dimly lit establishment that caters to both realm visitors. The proprietor, **Barnabas Saltwind** (a nervous human who'd clearly adapted to cross-realm pressure), claimed ignorance but his obvious anxiety suggested otherwise. Serafina's investigation revealed a hidden basement where illegal cross-realm artifacts were being traded. More importantly, they found evidence that someone had been using **memory extraction crystals** - a forbidden technology that could steal memories while leaving the victim alive but brain-dead. #### The Confrontation The session's climax came when the party confronted a **Void Merchant** (a shadowy figure whose face seemed to shift between forms) attempting to complete another memory extraction. The ensuing battle took place across multiple levels of the tavern, with pressure and altitude changes affecting combat as characters moved between realm-adapted sections. Kestra's sonic attacks proved especially effective against the Void entity, while Marcus used his knowledge of both realms to predict the creature's movement patterns. Lyralei summoned a localized storm within the tavern (much to Barnabas's dismay), and Thane's reality-anchoring abilities prevented the creature from phasing between dimensions. Serafina landed the killing blow with a precision strike that severed the creature's connection to its memory-extraction device. ### Major Discoveries 1. **The Void Merchants** are a cross-realm criminal organization trafficking in stolen memories and consciousness 2. The three missing merchants are still alive but in a vegetative state, their memories having been extracted and sold
3. The memory extraction process requires willing participation initially - victims are somehow convinced to submit voluntarily
4. There's a larger network operating beyond just this station
5. The stolen memories are being sold to wealthy collectors in both realms ### Character Moments **Kestra** had a beautiful moment where she attempted to use her musical magic to restore fragments of the victims' memories, leading to a touching scene where Captain Windwright briefly recognized her before slipping back into unconsciousness. **Marcus** struggled with the moral implications of the investigation, as his ranger training emphasized protecting all life, but these victims might be better off dead than living without their memories. **Lyralei** discovered that the unnatural weather patterns were actually the environment trying to reject the Void Merchants' presence - nature itself was fighting back. **Thane** faced a crisis of faith when he realized that even his reality-anchoring powers couldn't fully restore what had been taken from the victims. **Serafina** surprised everyone by showing genuine anger at the memory theft, revealing that she had personal experience with forced memory modification. ### Session Highlights **Best Roleplay Moment:** Kestra's attempt to restore Captain Windwright's memories through song **Most Creative Solution:** Lyralei using environmental pressure changes to trap the Void Merchant **Biggest Surprise:** Learning that the victims participated willingly in their own memory extraction **Funniest Moment:** Thane trying to maintain his dignity while adapting to underwater combat in a flooded basement **Most Dramatic:** Serafina's revelation about her own memory modification history ### Player Feedback Summary - Everyone enjoyed the investigation format - The cross-realm mechanics added interesting tactical options
