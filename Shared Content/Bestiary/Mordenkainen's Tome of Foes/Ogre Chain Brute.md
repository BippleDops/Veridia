***Chain Sweep.*** The ogre swings its chain, and every creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed saving throw, a creature takes 8 ( `dice: 1d8+4`) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

***Chain Smash (Recharge 6).** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ( `dice: 2d8+4`) bludgeoning damage, and the target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failure the target is unconscious for 1 minute. The unconscious target repeats the saving throw if it takes damage and at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Description
An ogre chain brute wields a great spiked chain. It swings this chain with both hands in a wide circle around itself to knock foes off their feet. Alternatively, it can swing the chain in a crushing overhead smash that's nearly impossible to block or deflect.
