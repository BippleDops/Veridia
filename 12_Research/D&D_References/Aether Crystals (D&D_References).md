Aether Crystals represent Aethermoor's revolutionary approach to currencyâ€”magical energy crystallized into stable, portable forms that serve both as medium of exchange and actual magical power source. Unlike traditional coinage, these crystals contain genuine magical energy that can be consumed for spellcasting, powering magical devices, or enhancing magical research. The crystal-based economy reflects Aethermoor's mastery of [[The Seven Shards|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]] energies and has transformed how magical societies approach both commerce and arcane practice. #### The Crystal Conspiracy

**Level**: 12-17 **Hook**: Prime-grade crystals develop sentience and begin making demands **Philosophy**: Explore rights of artificial magical intelligences **Consequences**: Sentient crystals refuse to be "spent" or consumed **Negotiation**: Establish relationship between humans and crystal consciousness **Impact**: Fundamental changes to economic system and magical theory #### The Crystal War
