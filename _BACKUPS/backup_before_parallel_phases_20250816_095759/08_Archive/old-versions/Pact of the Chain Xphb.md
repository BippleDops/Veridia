--- # Pact of the Chain

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 157. Available in the SRD* You learn the [[find-familiar-xphb (spells) spell and can cast it as a [actions#Magic|Magic]] action without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: [[Imp Xmm, [pseudodragon-xmm (dragon)]], [[quasit-xmm (fiend), [flaming-skeleton-xmm (undead)]], [[slaad-tadpole-xmm (aberration), [sphinx]], [[sprite-xmm (fey), or [venomous-snake-xmm]] (see appendix B for the familiar's stat block). Additionally, when you take the [[actions#Attack|Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its [reaction-xphb (variant-rules)]]. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Pact of the chain xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
