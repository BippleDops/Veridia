--- # Enlarge/Reduce

*2nd-level, Transmutation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute For the duration, the spell enlarges or reduces a creature or an object you can see within range (see the chosen effect below). A targeted object must be neither worn nor carried. If the target is an unwilling creature, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the spell has no effect. Everything that a targeted creature is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item it drops returns to normal size at once. A thrown weapon or piece of ammunition returns to normal size immediately after it hits or misses a target. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Enlarge The target's size increases by one category—from Medium to Large, for example. The target also has [[Advantage Xphb on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's attacks with its enlarged weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal an extra`d4`damage on a hit. ## Reduce The target's size decreases by one category—from Medium to Small, for example. The target also has [Advantage Xphb]] on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's attacks with its reduced weapons or Unarmed Strikes deal`d4`less damage on a hit (this can't reduce the damage below 1). ## Summary **Classes**: [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 268.

Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
