# Rain of Terror (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Touch (1-mile radius)

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 6 hours


## Effects
You draw a magical rune on the ground. An unusually dark, cursed storm develops over the next half-hour (if a storm is already present, the spell takes place immediately). You choose the nature of the rain from the following: ash, bats, blood and bits of flesh, centipedes, fish, lumps of gelatinous slime, putrid black, yellow, or red water, salaman-ders, small birds, small lizards, small snakes, spiders, toads, or worms. If the rain consists of living creatures, only around half of the animals will survive the fall. None of these animals are capable of harming anyone.
