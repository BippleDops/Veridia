## Description
One common means by which priests dispense the power of their god is through the sprinkling of holy water. Our chambered aspergill can carry up to one pint of holy water. By swinging or whirling the aspergill on its chain, a priest can disperse holy water farther than with a vial, whether doing so in the sanctuary or on the battlefield. Gold: 45 gp; Silver: 20 gp.

## Additional Details
Increases by 10 yards the radius affected by spells using holy water.
