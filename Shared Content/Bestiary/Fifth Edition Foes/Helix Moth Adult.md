## Special Traits
**Drone:** The rapid beating of the helix moth's wings creates an incessant droning sound that clouds the minds of creatures capable of hearing it. All such creatures within 30 feet of the moth must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or suffer a penalty identical to being poisoned (this is not a poison effect, however, so poison resistance and immunity don't apply). The effect lasts for 1 minute (10 rounds); at the end of that time, if the droning can still be heard, the saving throw can be repeated. A successful save renders a creature immune to the droning of helix moths for 12 hours.

**Helix Moth Poison:** If a player character drops to 0 hit points from a helix moth sting that caused poison damage (the character failed the saving throw), the character stabilizes automatically but remains unconscious for `dice: 2d6` hours. The character must attempt the saving throw even if the sting's piercing damage alone was enough to drop the character to 0 hit points. Healing the character above 0 hit points won't awaken the character before the `dice: 2d6` hours have elapsed. The character can awaken early only if the poison is neutralized by lesser restoration or similar magic.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** An adult helix moth bites once and stings once.

**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (`dice: 2d8+2`) piercing damage plus 4 (`dice: 1d8`) acid damage and the target is grappled. If the helix moth has a target grappled at the start of the moth's turn, it can do 11 (`dice: 2d8+2`) piercing damage plus 4 (`dice: 1d8`) acid damage to that target automatically if it does not try to bite another target.

**Sting:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d8+2`) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 9 (`dice: 2d8`) poison damage (see Helix Moth Poison above).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate forests

**Organization**: Solitary or pair

## Description
The lair of an adult helix moth usually can be found in a cave, a tunnel, a volcanic lava tube, or some other, similar structure. The entrances are difficult, if not impossible, for nonflying creatures to reach.

Helix moths are solitary creatures, though on rare occasions a mated pair might be encountered. When the time comes for a female helix moth to lay her eggs, she digs a tunnel down into the floor of her lair that is at least 15 feet long or longer. At its end, she hollows out a chamber at least 20 feet square, then she coats every surface of the tunnel and the chamber with thick, slightly acidic slime. The acid in the slime is weak enough to be harmless, but it tingles unpleasantly when it comes in contact with skin. In that chamber, she deposits up to twelve eggs.

The eggs hatch after just two weeks. If the mother is still around, she brings them food to keep them alive for the first few weeks. Otherwise, the hungry larvae attack and eat each other; this typically results in only half the larvae surviving their first weeks of life.

On rare occasions (1-in–6 chance), the secretions of the larvae react with the slime covering their chamber to form a vapor that’s poisonous to other creatures who inhale it. Creatures other than helix moths breathing the fumes must make a successful DC 11 Con saving throw or take `dice: 1d8` poison damage. The saving throw must be repeated after every minute of continued exposure.

Despite their imposing size and ferocious appearance, helix moths are normally inoffensive creatures toward humanoids. They are nocturnal hunters, and their usual prey is deer, elk, pheasant, and boar. A helix moth journeys up to a mile from its lair in search of prey. Slain prey is carried back to the lair to be eaten.

The exception to this behavior is when a mother helix moth has a brood of larvae to feed. At those times, she becomes quite aggressive, attacking anything made of meat. Ideally, the mother brings something back for her larvae that is unconscious but still alive.
