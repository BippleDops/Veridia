Chief Mako Ironjaw is the most feared law enforcement officer in [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos, leading an elite unit of enforcers who patrol the deepest, most dangerous districts where regular authorities fear to tread. A hybrid born from human-sahuagin union during the early days of the submersion, he possesses the best traits of both species: human intelligence and adaptability combined with sahuagin predatory instincts and natural aquatic abilities. His relentless pursuit of criminals, especially [Jasper "Three-Eyes" Flint]] and his organization, has made him legendary throughout the depths. ## Secrets
