Though I cannot imagine doing battle in this constrictive and torturous device, many female warriors swear that the attractiveness produced by an armored corset often lets them avert combat altogether. Available in leather for 5 gp (6 lb), [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items for Dungeons & Dragons 5e SRD/Chain|chain]] mail for 25 gp (14 lb), and scale mail 45 gp (14 lb), all of the armored corsets we carry include steel stays for the perfect waistline. One size fits all. Be sure to have a fainting couch on hand when suiting up. Not recommended for very heavy folks.
