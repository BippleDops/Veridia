*Wondrous item, uncommon* This small packet contains``dice: 1d6` + 4`pinches of dust. As a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust over water, turning up to a 15-foot [Cube Area of Effect Xphb]] of water into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet's weight is negligible. A creature can take a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so destroys the pellet and ends its magic. As a [actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the dust on an Elemental within 5 feet of yourself that is composed mostly of water (such as a [[water-elemental-xmm (elemental) or a [water-weird-xmm (elemental)]]). Such a creature exposed to a pinch of the dust makes a **DC 13** Constitution saving throw, taking``dice: 10d6``Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 255.
