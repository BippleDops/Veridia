# The Reflection Pools

![The Reflection Pools Portrait](04_Resources/Assets/Art/Places/The_Reflection_Pools.png)

*Where every choice not taken shimmers in the water*

## Overview

Hidden in the Twilight Depths between the Sunken Palace and the Whispering Trenches, the Reflection Pools are a series of thirteen interconnected basins where the boundaries between possibility and actuality grow thin. Each pool shows not what is, but what could be—or what could have been. The site serves as Aquabyssos's premier divination center, though its revelations often drive visitors to madness or despair.

The Pools predate recorded history, possibly existing before water itself. They are maintained by the Order of Mirrors, blind oracles who navigate by reading the ripples of possibility. Politicians, lovers, generals, and desperate souls all make pilgrimages here, though few leave with the answers they sought.

## Physical Description

### The Approach
Reaching the Reflection Pools requires navigating the Corridor of Choices, a winding tunnel where each fork represents a significant decision in the visitor's life:
- **Length**: 3 miles of branching passages
- **Branches**: Unique to each visitor

- **Time**: Takes exactly as long as needed for contemplation

## Inhabitants

### The Order of Mirrors

**High Oracle Serendipity Twelve-Lives**
Leader of the Order, who exists in twelve possible versions simultaneously:

**Serendipity Twelve-Lives** (CR 15)
*Medium humanoid (human), true neutral*

**Armor Class** 15 (foresight)
**Hit Points** 135 (18d8 + 54)
**Speed** 30 ft., swim 30 ft.

STR 9 (-1), DEX 14 (+2), CON 16 (+3), INT 20 (+5), WIS 24 (+7), CHA 18 (+4)

**Saving Throws** Int +10, Wis +12, Cha +9
**Skills** Arcana +10, History +10, Insight +17, Perception +12, Religion +10
**Damage Resistances** psychic
**Condition Immunities** surprised
**Senses** blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond this radius), passive Perception 22
**Languages** All
**Challenge** 15 (13,000 XP)

**Twelve-Fold Existence.** Serendipity exists in twelve parallel versions. When she would take damage, roll a d12. On a 12, the damage happens to a different version and she takes no damage.

**Probability Sight.** Serendipity can see all possible actions a creature might take in the next minute. She has advantage on all saving throws and cannot be surprised.

**Quantum Uncertainty.** Serendipity's exact position is uncertain. Attack rolls against her have disadvantage.

**Spellcasting.** Serendipity is an 18th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 20, +12 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): *guidance*, *mending*, *sacred flame*, *spare the dying*, *thaumaturgy*
1st level (4 slots): *bless*, *command*, *detect magic*, *identify*
2nd level (3 slots): *augury*, *calm emotions*, *detect thoughts*, *see invisibility*
3rd level (3 slots): *clairvoyance*, *dispel magic*, *speak with dead*
4th level (3 slots): *divination*, *freedom of movement*, *locate creature*
5th level (3 slots): *commune*, *legend lore*, *scrying*
6th level (1 slot): *find the path*, *true seeing*
7th level (1 slot): *etherealness*, *plane shift*
8th level (1 slot): *antimagic field*, *feeblemind*
9th level (1 slot): *foresight*, *time stop*

**Actions**
**Multiattack.** Serendipity makes two Possibility Strike attacks.

**Possibility Strike.** *Melee Spell Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (5d8) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned as they experience all possible outcomes of the attack simultaneously.

**Show the Paths (Recharge 5-6).** Serendipity forces a creature within 60 feet to see all their possible futures at once. The target must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they take 55 (10d10) psychic damage and are paralyzed for 1 minute as they process infinite possibilities. On a success, they take half damage and gain advantage on all rolls for 1 minute as they see the optimal path.

**Legendary Actions**
Serendipity can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below.
- **Glimpse.** Serendipity learns one possible action a creature within 60 feet might take.
- **Shift.** Serendipity moves to a slightly different probability, moving up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Prophesy (Costs 2 Actions).** Serendipity speaks a prophecy about one creature she can see. For the next minute, whenever that creature rolls a 1, they can reroll and must use the new result.

### Mirror Novices
Young oracles in training who tend the pools:
- Blindfolded to prevent madness
- Navigate by possibility currents
- Speak primarily in hypotheticals
- Age backwards when they make accurate prophecies

### The Reflected
Beings pulled from the pools—versions that could have been:
- Partially translucent
- Speak of histories that never happened
- Cannot exist long outside pool vicinity
- Sometimes replace their "real" versions

### Pool Guardians
Elemental beings of crystallized possibility:

**Possibility Elemental** (CR 9)
*Large elemental, unaligned*

**Armor Class** 16 (natural armor)
**Hit Points** 114 (12d10 + 48)
**Speed** 40 ft., swim 40 ft.

STR 18 (+4), DEX 14 (+2), CON 18 (+4), INT 10 (+0), WIS 15 (+2), CHA 12 (+1)

**Damage Resistances** bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks
**Damage Immunities** poison
**Condition Immunities** exhaustion, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, unconscious
**Senses** darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 12
**Languages** Aquan, Primordial
**Challenge** 9 (5,000 XP)

**Quantum Form.** The elemental exists in multiple states simultaneously. When it takes damage, roll a d6. On a 6, the damage happens to an alternate version and the elemental takes no damage.

**Probability Aura.** Creatures within 10 feet of the elemental have disadvantage on attack rolls as their actions become uncertain.

**Actions**
**Multiattack.** The elemental makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (3d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) force damage.

**Possibility Storm (Recharge 5-6).** The elemental creates a 20-foot radius storm of conflicting realities. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 36 (8d8) psychic damage and rolls on the Possibility Storm table. On a success, they take half damage and no additional effect.

**Possibility Storm Table (d6)**
1. Creature exchanges positions with another random creature in the storm
2. Creature ages 1d10 years or becomes 1d10 years younger (50% chance each)
3. Creature's alignment shifts one step in a random direction for 1 hour
4. Creature forgets the last 24 hours
5. Creature gains a random memory from another creature in the storm
6. Creature splits into two versions for 1 minute (both controlled by player, but only one remains when effect ends)

## Adventure Hooks

### The Stolen Timeline
Someone has been using the pools to steal favorable outcomes from other timelines, causing reality distortions. The party must track the thief through multiple possibilities and stop them before reality collapses.

### The Prophet's Paradox
A young oracle has seen their own death in every pool—except one that shows them destroying the Reflection Pools. The party must protect them while investigating if the prophecy is true or a manipulation.

### The Reflected Invasion
Alternate versions of significant NPCs have been emerging from the pools and replacing their originals. The party must determine which are real and why the barriers between possibilities are weakening.

### The Impossible Child
A child who was never born has emerged from the Pool of What Was Never Born, claiming to be the offspring of a party member. Their existence is causing reality paradoxes that threaten to unravel causality.

### The Council of Selves
A powerful wizard has gathered versions of themselves from twelve different timelines to form a council. They seek to use the Reflection Pools to merge all timelines where they exist into one where they are god-emperor.

## Treasures

- Can communicate with alternate selves
- Breaking a mirror may trap you in that possibility

### The Certainty Stone

## Environmental Hazards

### Probability Storms
- Random events from other timelines manifest
- Duration: 1d10 minutes
- Effects: Roll on wild magic table every round

### Temporal Whirlpools
- Drain years from those caught within
- Can age or de-age victims
- Sometimes transport to other timelines

### Reality Fractures
- Cracks where possibilities leak through
- Stepping through leads to alternate timeline
- May close suddenly, trapping travelers

### Quantum Locks
- Areas where no choices can be made
- All actions become predetermined
- Free will returns after leaving area

## The Deep Secrets

### The Truth of the Pools
Unknown to most, the Reflection Pools are not natural phenomena but prison cells. Each pool contains a trapped god from a timeline that was prevented from existing. The reflections are their attempts to escape into reality.

### The Thirteenth Pool's Purpose
The central pool doesn't show possibilities—it creates them. Every reflection that forms there becomes real somewhere. The Order of Mirrors actually works to prevent too many possibilities from spawning.

### The Price of Prophecy
Each prophecy made drains possibility from the future, making reality more rigid and predetermined. Too much divination could lock the timeline into an inescapable fate.

## DM Notes

### Running the Reflection Pools

**Preparation**:
- Create 3-5 alternate timelines for the campaign
- Prepare how major NPCs differ in each
- Consider what choices the PCs didn't make

**Showing Possibilities**:
- Be specific but not prescriptive
- Show consequences, not just events
- Make some possibilities clearly better/worse
- Include impossible but desired outcomes

**Managing Paradoxes**:
- Small paradoxes create minor inconveniences
- Medium paradoxes attract temporal predators
- Large paradoxes require divine intervention
- Campaign-ending paradoxes should be telegraphed

### Scaling Encounters
- **Level 1-5**: Simple consultations, minor visions
- **Level 6-10**: Deep viewing, meeting alternates
- **Level 11-15**: Timeline manipulation, major prophecies
- **Level 16-20**: Reality-altering possibilities

### Integration Ideas
- Make the pools a recurring element
- Have NPCs reference consulting them
- Use them to foreshadow campaign events
- Let players glimpse alternate campaigns
