# Quickened Spell
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 142. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span>*  

When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to change the casting time to a [Bonus Action](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) for this casting. You can't modify a spell in this way if you've already cast a level 1+ spell on the current turn, nor can you cast a level 1+ spell on this turn after modifying a spell in this way.
