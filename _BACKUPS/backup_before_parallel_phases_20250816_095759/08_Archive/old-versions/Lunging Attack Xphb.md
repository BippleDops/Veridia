--- # Lunging Attack

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 95* As a [[Action Xphb, you can expend one Superiority Die and take the [actions#Dash|Dash]] action. If you move at least 5 feet in a straight line immediately before hitting with a melee attack as part of the [[actions#Attack|Attack]] action on this turn, you can add the Superiority Die to the attack's damage roll. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Lunging attack xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
