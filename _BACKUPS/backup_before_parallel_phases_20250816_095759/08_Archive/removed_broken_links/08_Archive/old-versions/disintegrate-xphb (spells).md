--- # Disintegrate

*6th-level, Transmutation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and dust)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous You launch a green ray at a target you can see within range. The target can be a creature, a nonmagical object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by [[Wall of Force Xphb. A creature targeted by this spell makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes``dice: 10d6` + 40`Force damage. If this damage reduces it to 0 [hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]], it and everything nonmagical it is wearing and carrying are disintegrated into gray dust. The target can be revived only by a [[True Resurrection Xphb or a [wish-xphb (spells)]] spell. This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If such a target is Huge or larger, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-[[Cube Area of Effect Xphb portion of it. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by``dice: 3d6``for each spell slot level above 6. **Classes**: [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 263.
