--- # Gift of the Protectors

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 156* **Prerequisite**: Level 9 Warlock A new page appears in your Book of Shadows when you conjure it. With your permission, a creature can take an action to write its name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one name). When any creature whose name is on the page is reduced to 0 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules) but not killed outright, the creature magically drops to 1 [hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] instead. Once this magic is triggered, no creature can benefit from it until you finish a [[long-rest-xphb. As a [actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you can erase a name on the page by touching it. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Gift of the protectors xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
