# Wand of Viscid Globs
*Wand, rare (requires attunement)*  


- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

Crafted by the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/priest-acolyte-xmm|drow]], this slim black wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cause a small glob of viscous material to launch from the tip at one creature within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged attack roll against the target, with a bonus equal to your spellcasting modifier (or your Intelligence modifier, if you don't have a spellcasting modifier) plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the glob expands and dries on the target, which is [[conditions#Restrained|restrained]] for 1 hour. After that time, the viscous material cracks and falls away.

Applying a pint or more of alcohol to the [[conditions#Restrained|restrained]] creature dissolves the glob instantly, as does the application of [[oil-of-etherealness-xdmg|oil of etherealness]] or [[universal-solvent-xdmg|universal solvent]]. The glob also dissolves instantly if exposed to sunlight. No other nonmagical process can remove the viscous material until it deteriorates on its own.

The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at midnight. If you expend the wands last charge, roll a `d20`. On a 1, the wand melts into harmless slime and is destroyed.

A wand of viscous globs is destroyed if exposed to sunlight for 1 hour without interruption.
