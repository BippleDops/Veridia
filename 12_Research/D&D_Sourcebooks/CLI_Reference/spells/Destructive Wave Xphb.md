# Destructive Wave
*5th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Sphere)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Destructive energy ripples outward from you in a 30-foot [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]]. Each creature you choose in the [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes `5d6` Thunder damage and `5d6` Radiant or Necrotic damage (your choice) and has the [[conditions#Prone|Prone]] condition. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.

**Classes**: [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-tempest-domain "class=XPHB"|Cleric (Tempest Domain)]]; [[list-spells-classes-paladin|Paladin]]
