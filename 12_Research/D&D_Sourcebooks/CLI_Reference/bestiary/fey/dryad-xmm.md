## Dryad

*Tree-Bound Guardian of Nature*

- **Habitat.** Forest  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Guardians of the woodlands, dryads magically flit from tree to tree and from root to bough, harrying trespassers with tangling vines and thorns. Most of these elusive beings have a special connection with one plant or a natural sanctuary that they protect. Some also share physical similarities with the plants they're most connected to. Dryads might sicken or die if their plant or sanctuary is destroyed, recovering only if it is healed or magically replaced. Roll on or choose an option from the Dryad Sanctuaries table to inspire a dryad's bond.

**Dryad Sanctuaries**

| dice: 1d6 | The Dryad Dwells in and Protects... |
|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| 1 | An acres-large clonal colonyâ€”a stand of identical, interconnected trees. |
| 2 | A fortress-like tree, like a baobab or sequoia. |
| 3 | A living lockâ€”a plant that seals evil below or blocks the path to a dungeon. |
| 4 | A lonely tree that stands atop a windswept mountain or amid a [[conditions#Petrified|petrified]] forest. |
| 5 | A plant with magic fruit or remarkable seeds. |
| 6 | A shambling mound or treant that the dryad lives in or around as a Fey symbiote. |
