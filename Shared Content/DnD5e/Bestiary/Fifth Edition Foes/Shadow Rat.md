## Special Traits
**[[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Horrors 5e/A-C/Cadaver|Cadaver]] Fever:** At the end of a battle against shadow rats, anyone who was bitten by a shadow rat must make a DC 9 Constitution saving throw against disease. Failure indicates the character is infected with cadaver fever. An infected character gains one level of exhaustion immediately and must repeat the saving throw at the end of every long rest. Each failed saving throw adds one more level of exhaustion; a successful saving throw at the end of a long rest means only that the characters condition doesnt worsen. The character recovers fully when he or she makes successful saving throws at the ends of two consecutive long rests or when lesser restoration or comparable magic is used on the character.

**Shadow Form (1/Day):** As an action, a shadow rat can assume shadow form for up to 1 hour. While in shadow form, its AC increases to 14, it gains immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons, and it can move through solid objects and other creatures as if they were difficult terrain. The shadow rat is destroyed if it is still inside something solid at the end of its turn.

**Shadow Blend:** A shadow rat becomes invisible when it moves into darkness, dim light, or any other space where it is heavily obscured.

## Actions
**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 1 piercing damage and the target may be infected with [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Horrors 5e/A-C/Cadaver|cadaver]] fever (see above).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
Shadow rats are undead rats that can blend effortlessly into shadows and even reduce their physical form to shadows for a limited time. Other than their semitranslucent skin (which they have even in shadow form), they resemble normal rats in every other aspect.

Shadow rats attack relentlessly with their bite attack. Unlike normal shadows, shadow rats do not create spawn.
