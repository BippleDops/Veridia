## Description
Eblis form a semi-civilized society of storkmen that make their homes in desolate swamps and marshes. They rarely interact with other races, preferring the company of their own kind and the serenity of their marshland homes.

An eblis is a large bird that strongly resembles a stork—so much so that eblis are often called “stork men.” An eblis stands about 8 feet tall, and its neck is extremely long and snakelike. With it, an eblis is capable of blindingly fast movement. Storkmen are very fast at shifting and striking, and their necks are very powerful despite their slenderness. They attack by stabbing with their beak, which is long, sharp, and deadly.

A male eblis has graybrown feathers with reddish patches on its head, while a female lacks the red patch
