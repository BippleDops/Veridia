**Leader**: High Inquisitor Valerius
**Headquarters**: The Citadel of Azure Flame
**Location**: [[The Whispering Peaks|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Whispering Peaks ## Description

**Details**: Rich sensory elements bring this to life.

The Order of the Azure Flame is a militant monastic order dedicated to the eradication of arcane magic. They believe that the misuse of magic was the sole cause of the Sundering, and they see it as their sacred duty to prevent such a cataclysm from ever happening again. The Order is known for its fanatical devotion to its cause, and its members are highly trained in the detection and suppression of magic. ## Methods

The Order employs a variety of methods to achieve its goals, from public burnings of magical artifacts to secret inquisitions and assassinations. They are masters of propaganda and have a great deal of influence over the common people, who they have convinced that magic is a dangerous and corrupting force. ## Player-Facing Summary The Order of the Azure Flame is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Order of the Azure Flame as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around The Order of the Azure Flame. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A merchant needs help delivering before dawn
