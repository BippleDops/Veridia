# Frostfire (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of ivory, a pinch of soot, and a shard of clear crystal)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour


## Effects
You point to a fire of any size within range and change it so that it becomes cold, not hot. For the duration of the spell, the flames burn clear blue. The fire must be one that burns for at least one minute, not one with an instantaneous duration (such as a *fireball* spell). This spell produces one of three effects:

♦ ***Cool Flame.*** This removes all heat from the flame. It still burns fuel and pro-duces light but it causes no damage if touched.

♦ ***Cold Flame.*** This alters the flame so it does cold damage instead of fire damage.

♦ ***Chilled Flame.*** You make a ranged spell attack against one fire elemental or creature that is currently aflame due to magical ability (not one that has been set on fire in order to hurt it). On a hit, it inflicts 2d10 cold damage to that creature.
