One creature that you can see within range must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the [[conditions#Blinded|Blinded]] or [[conditions#Deafened|Deafened]] condition (your choice) for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 2.
