# The Last Anchor

Only one song still holds the world together, and you can feel it in your teeth.

What you notice
- A single note in the air
- The horizon looks thin

What you can try
- Keep the song steady
- Do what it takes

Possible outcomes
- The world steadies under your hands
- It holds for now
- It breaks
