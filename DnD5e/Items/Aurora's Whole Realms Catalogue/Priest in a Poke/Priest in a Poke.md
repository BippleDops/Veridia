# Priest in a Poke
## Overview
Of course, true healing comes only by the gods, and gods are notoriously clannish about whom they grant powers to (read “priests”). Occasionally, parties must embark on adventures without a healer in the company, due to either a dearth of priests or a dearth of priestly courage. Therefore, I offer the following healing devices, grouped under the whimsical title “Priest in a Poke” because they are too crude and painful to ever be used by a priest-toting company. Crude and painful, yes, but occasionally life-saving too. In addition to offering the stock supplies such as bandages and splints, we stock tools smuggled from the dark land of Thay, whose inhabitants are more often interested in killing than healing. Though I cannot vouch for the healing effectiveness of any of these [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Items|items]], they remain popular among those desperate folks who travel priestless.
