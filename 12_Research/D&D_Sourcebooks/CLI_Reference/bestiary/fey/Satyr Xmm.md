Satyrs enjoy demonstrating their physicality through contests, evicting party poopers, and defending Fey realms.

## Satyrs

*Horned and Hoofed Revelers*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Planar (Feywild)  
- **Treasure.** Implements  

Satyrs embody the untamed joys of the wilderness. They indulge in sprees of merrymaking—eating, drinking, performing, fighting, and frolicking.

forest, planar, feywild

## Player-Facing Summary

Satyr xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of satyr xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around satyr xmm.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties satyr xmm to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at satyr xmm to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to satyr xmm active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
