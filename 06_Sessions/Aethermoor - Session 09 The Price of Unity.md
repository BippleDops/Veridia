--- # Session 9: [[The Price of Unity > *Dawn approaches. The merged city is in chaos - some citizens exist in both forms simultaneously.* ## üîß [Deep Evaluation]] Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### [[Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### [Enhancement Improvements]] - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## üé¨ [[Strong Start Dawn approaches. The merged city is in chaos - some citizens exist in both forms simultaneously, others are trapped between worlds. The party has one hour to stabilize the situation before the transformation becomes permanent. Buildings phase in and out of existence. The bloodline carrier feels their humanity slipping away with each passing minute. ## üîç Secrets & Clues 1. The merge can be adjusted for different districts

2. Some transformed citizens prefer their new forms
3. Aquabyssos technology could revolutionize Aethermoor
4. [The Entity]] left seeds of itself in some citizens
5. [[Marina-Red-Tide-Coralheart's bloodline can speak for Aquabyssos
6. [The Queen]] and [[[Captain Lyanna Brightshield]] share a soul-bond
7. Time moves differently in merged zones
8. Children adapt to the merge most easily
9. [[[The Crimson Sage]] left one final message
10. Perfect unity is impossible but harmony is achievable ## üé≠ [[Cliffhanger Ending As the stabilization completes, the bloodline carrier makes their choice about the crown. Suddenly, a message arrives from the [Eastern Kingdoms]] - they've detected the reality shift and are sending a fleet to "quarantine the anomaly." Worse, deep beneath [[Aquabyssos, something ancient stirs - something the [Drowned God]] was keeping asleep. [[[The Crimson Sage]]'s final message plays: "The seven shards were not the first prison. They will not be the last. When the [[Deep Mother wakes, both worlds must stand as one." The ocean beneath the floating city begins to boil. ## üìù DM Notes```[Citizen Management]]:
