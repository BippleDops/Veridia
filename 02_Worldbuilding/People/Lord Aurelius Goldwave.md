# Lord Aurelius Goldwave
*The Golden Tongue of Port Meridian*

> *"My ancestors made a choice that damned us all. I intend to make a choice that redeems us. The price of redemption, you ask? Everything I have built, everything I am, everything I could become. But some debts can only be paid in full."*

## Overview
Lord Aurelius Goldwave is the wealthiest and most influential merchant-noble in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]], descended from Aurelius the Goldweaver - one of the Seven Betrayers who shattered [[The Crown of Stars]] 500 years ago. Though he presents himself as a successful trader and benevolent patron of the arts, he secretly leads [[The Order of the Shattered Crown]], dedicated to gathering the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]] to undo his ancestor's great sin. His vast fortune, built through crystal trade and careful political manipulation, serves a single purpose: atonement for the betrayal that doomed Aethermoor to centuries of crystal corruption.

## Appearance

## Background & History

### The Goldwave Legacy
The Goldwave family descended from Aurelius the Goldweaver, the most powerful enchanter among [[The Seven Betrayers]]. His ancestor's specialty was financial manipulation and mass persuasion - abilities he used to convince the other six to betray [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage|Aetheron]]. When the Crown shattered, the Goldweaver was consumed by the Golden Shard's power, leaving behind only his techniques and a massive fortune built on betrayal.

### The Burden of Knowledge
Unlike most descendants of the Betrayers, the Goldwave family maintained detailed records of their ancestor's actions. Aurelius learned the full truth at age 16 when he inherited the family's secret archives. The revelation shattered his worldview and set him on his current path of redemption.

### Building an Empire
Over thirty years, Aurelius transformed the family's inherited wealth into the largest trading empire in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]]. He:
- Monopolized the safe transport of crystal goods
- Established the Goldwave Academy for Crystal Studies
- Created a network of agents throughout Aethermoor
- Secretly founded and funded [[The Order of the Shattered Crown]]

### The Order of the Shattered Crown
This secretive organization, led by Aurelius, seeks to:
- Locate and gather all [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]]
- Undo the betrayal by reforging the Crown of Stars
- Restore [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage|Aetheron]] to proper godhood
- End crystal corruption permanently

The Order operates through legitimate businesses, scholarly research, and careful political influence rather than force or theft.

## Current Role & Position

### Political Standing
- **Title**: Lord Merchant of the Golden Quarter, Patron of the Crystal Arts
- **Territory**: Controls the wealthiest district of Port Meridian and major shipping lanes

- **Public Role**: Advocates for responsible crystal use and trade regulation

### Opposed By:

## Secrets & Hidden Agendas

> [!warning] DM Only - The True Plan
> Lord Goldwave doesn't just want to gather the Seven Shards - he plans to use them to travel back in time and prevent the original betrayal. He's discovered that the Golden Shard, currently within [[Aria Lumengarde]], can theoretically power such a spell. His real goal is to sacrifice himself to undo the timeline where his ancestor betrayed Aetheron, accepting that this would erase his own existence.

### Hidden Resources:
1. **The Temporal Calculations**: Mathematical formulas for time magic using Shard energy
2. **The Betrayer's Vault**: Hidden repository containing artifacts from all Seven Betrayers
3. **The Redemption Ritual**: A spell designed to channel all seven Shards' power into time manipulation
4. **The Memory Archive**: Preserved consciousness fragments from his ancestor and the other Betrayers

### Secret Knowledge:
- Knows the exact identity and location of most Shard holders
- Has mapped the crystal corruption patterns to predict future spread
- Understands the true nature of [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]] as the diminished Aetheron
- Possesses fragments of pre-Shattering divine magic
- Has been in secret communication with other Betrayer descendants

### The Goldwave Guilt Complex
Aurelius suffers from what he calls "inherited sin" - the belief that his bloodline carries the cosmic debt of his ancestor's betrayal. This drives him toward increasingly desperate measures, including:
- Considering mass memory modification to ease corruption suffering
- Planning to manipulate [[Aria Lumengarde]] to access the Golden Shard
- Preparing to betray current allies if necessary for the greater good
- Accepting that his redemption plan will likely destroy him and everyone he cares about

## Quest Hooks

### Early Campaign (Levels 1-5):
1. **The Generous Patron**: Lord Goldwave hires the party for seemingly routine crystal transport jobs that lead to greater mysteries
2. **Academy Investigation**: Strange incidents at Goldwave Academy require discrete investigation
3. **The Merchant's Dilemma**: Goldwave needs the party to recover stolen shipments from crystal smugglers
4. **Historical Research**: He commissions the party to explore ruins related to the original Betrayal

### Mid Campaign (Levels 6-10):
1. **The Order Revealed**: The party discovers Goldwave's connection to the Order of the Shattered Crown
2. **Shard Hunt**: Direct missions to locate and secure one of the Seven Shards
3. **Family Sins**: Investigating other descendants of the Betrayers leads to moral complexities
4. **The Corruption Crisis**: Goldwave needs help containing a crystal corruption outbreak he accidentally caused

### Late Campaign (Levels 11+):
1. **The Time Gambit**: Goldwave reveals his plan to undo the original betrayal and asks for the party's help
2. **Redemption's Price**: The party must choose between supporting his temporal plan or stopping him
3. **The Betrayer's Legacy**: Confronting the consequences of ancestral sins across multiple timelines
4. **The Golden Sacrifice**: Goldwave's final attempt at redemption threatens to unravel reality itself
