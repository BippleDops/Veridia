## Special Traits
**Escape Artist (1/Day):** The golden cat teleports up to 30 feet as a move.

**Luck/Unluck (3/Day):** The owner of a golden cat can reroll one die and take the most favorable result, provided the golden cat is within 40 feet of its owner. Only one reroll is allowed per round. This ability is a power of the cat, which responds to its owner's telepathic request for luck. There is a downside, however. Each time the golden cat grants luck (a reroll) to its owner, it saps a bit of luck from other, nearby creatures. All other creatures (including the owner's allies) within 40 feet of the golden cat have tactical disadvantage on their first attack roll or ability check for one round.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate land

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
These fickle creatures are highly sought after for their magical ability to grant luck to the person fortunate enough to be selected as their owners. Some people have been known to spend extravagant amounts of gold trying first to locate a golden cat, and then to keep the cat lavishly protected, entertained, comfortable, and contented. Despite this, golden cats tend to grow bored easily with an owner. When that happens, they wander off on their own in search of someone new and interesting to bestow their good luck upon. It’s important to note that a golden cat bestows luck on an owner only while it’s pleased to belong to that creature. Nothing compels a golden cat to provide luck against its will, just because it was asked. Imprisoning a golden cat with the intention of forcing it to supply good luck is a sure way to lose its favor and guarantee that it provides no bonuses at all. Frequently carrying one into dangerous, frightening situations and cold, damp, lightless dungeons is another.

While prized by their owners for the luck they bestow, golden cats tend to be equally despised by the owner’s allies for the bad luck they bring to everyone around their owner.

In the wild, golden cats tend to lair in forested areas or hilly terrain, usually near civilized lands where generous, indulgent owners are easy to find. They favor humans and elves as owners above other races, and never accept an orc, half-orc, goblin, or other savage as an owner.

A golden cat appears as a normal cat with rich golden fur and green eyes. Like all cats, a golden cat enjoys catching mice, rabbits and small birds. They fight larger creatures only if that’s their only option.
