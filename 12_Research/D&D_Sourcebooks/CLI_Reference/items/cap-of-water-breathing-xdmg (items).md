*Wondrous item, uncommon* While wearing this cap underwater, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to create a bubble of air around your head. This bubble allows you to breathe normally underwater. This bubble stays with you until the cap is removed or you are no longer underwater. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 242* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Cap of water breathing xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
