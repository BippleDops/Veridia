### Dust in the Wind

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> Any party members who survive the Explosion will find themselves in a rapidly filling pool of water at the bottom of the ladder shaft. This is not intended as a trap in and of itself, it being the last remnant of the water supply used to set the trap originally. The space at the bottom of the shaft wil1 fill up to the level of the old floor then stop. This does create apooJ 10 feet deep, in the 10 by 10 foot shaft. Heavily armored delvers will be well advised to exit as fast as they can through a door in the waJl directly under the place where the ladder ended. (Any delvers that are really slow on the uptake can be forced to make a roll to survive being immersed. However, at this point it is unlikely that any of them will be dumb enough to stand about and wait for the water to lap over their heads.)
> 
> The delvers will find themselves in a corridor 30 feet long and 10 feet wide. At the corridors end there is an obvious door. The doors surface is covered with bronze plate into which a design has been impressed. The design shows the stubby figure you recognize as Evinrood. He seems to be fighting a battery of half-seen images, the rest of the inlaid figures are very indistinct. They seem to be horrific creatures but the work appears to be incomplete and the images only half formed.
> 
> The door has a golden lever as its latch release. (The gold value is about 150 to 175 g.p.-the question WILL be asked.) This will give the party a few moments of concern, especially when they pluck up the courage to tum it (A gang of delving thugs don't like anything out of the ordinary, and will often bicker about the "signs and portents" of a "different" event endlessly!)
> 
> When the latch is depressed there is an audible "click". (If you thought the party was concerned before this should put them really on edge.) The door opens into the hallway and reveals a room 30 feet by 30 feet with a 20 foot ceiling. In the center of the room is a raised dais on which sits yet another sarcophagus. Above the sarcophagus there is a vast, rapidly turning ceiling fan, the arms of which are over 10 feet in length. It is made of woven rattan and as such it is not likely to be lethal. (Ah, those whirling blades of doom, I have used them well, alas.) The fan does cause a fairly stiff breeze within the confines of the room.
> 
> The sarcophagus is made of black stone, and is very plain, save that the lid is held in place by four golden balls. These balls are very large, 14 inches in diameter, and appear to be attached somehow to the top of the sarcophagus.
> 
> The walls of the room are covered with a fresco of Evinrood working in what seems to be a laboratory, when a large birdlike creature arrives with a parcel. Out of the parcel emerges an army of misshapen deamons. Evinrood struggles in vain against them and is overwhelmed. The last panel shows Evinrood rising from the floor in his laboratory, and the deamons are gone. Every last one of them, vanished!
> 
> The frescos will serve more to confuse the party than aid it, but then what can they expect from clues provided by an eccentric high-level mage?
> 
> The tomb robbers will try a variety of methods to open the sarcophagus before trying the gold balls. Which they are sure are will release some bizarre doom. But, gold being gold, the balls will keep drawing them back. The balls are screwed onto metal posts at the comers of the sarcophagus. They will tum easily and after a point they will come free. The balls are fairly thick but hollow, their value in gold is 1,250 g.p. each. But their chief value will not be the gold but what they contain.
> 
> Just as the party frees the first ball (It would be really wild if the delvers would release all the balls at once!) a very fine whitish-pink powder will spill out of the ball. This will be very hard to stop as the posts are 5 inches in diameter, and the party is unlikely to expect the golden ball to be a container. The party will also be lifting the ball off the post so a large spill is even more likely. The powder is so fine that the wind from the fan will swirl it instantly about the room. If the delvers trashed the fan earlier on, in act of delverlike vandalism the effect will be diminished but by no means eliminated.
> 
> The powder is the "dust" of the "Blood Dream Poppy". It is a violent, and nearly instantaneous hallucinogen. Characters with below average constitutions (including those who's constitutions have been weakened by trap damage) will succumb instantly to the drugs effects. These individuals will collapse to the floor writhing and twitching in fear from dreams too horrible to imagine. Among these individuals there is 40% chance (lA) of complete madness. (If all four balls were removed at once the dose will be massive, and the chance of madness for below average delvers will be 80%! (L8))
> 
> For delvers with average to sligh ti y above average constitutions the "dust" will create vivid images of horrific monsters, or terrible traps closing upon them. They will strike out at anything that comes to hand, not recognizing friends, or even inanimate objects. There is a 25 % chance (L3) that any character of average constitution will from this point on experience flash backs to this drug effect for the rest of the delvers career. (For the purposes of future play there is a 1 % chance in a critical situation that the delver will "flash-back" and attack friends instead of foes. Fellows like this are often tagged with the nickname Whosits the Mad!)
> 
> Delvers possessed of extraordinary constitutions will have a 25% chance (L3) of succumbing to the effects of the drug as described for the Average constitution delvers above. If they don't come under the effects they will find their movements sluggish and less well directed than usual. They will have lost their "edge". Thus if the average characters are thrashing around trying to kill the "deamons" they see, the "tougher" delvers will have to defend themselves at 1/2 effectiveness.
> 
> All the effects will pass in 10 minutes, with the exception of the madness and flashbacks. The Poppy "dust" has a significant commercial value if it can be contained. (Where there is a will there is a way, and the delvers will be carrying this stuff around corked in the gold balls.)
> 
> (Note: If the fan is broken reduce all the percentages by 10%, the dust will disseminate from the gestures required to remove the ball and the cloud will have its effect. Even a very small amount of this stuff goes a long long way!)
> 
> The sarcophagus is just a solid stone slab with an inlaid line at the top to give the illusion that there is a lid to be removed.
> 
> In the left hand corner of the room nearest [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] is a standard three finger hole door, possibly revealed by stucco removed during the party's drug induced struggles.
> 
> This is a two skull trap. Death will onl􀃘 result if sufficient "average" delvers are effected, otherwise the effects are entertaining but less than lethal.
