*Level 5 Bastion facility* - **Prerequisites**: None
- **Space**: Roomy (16 sq) or Vast (36 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 1 (Roomy) or 2 (Vast)
- **Order**: harvest A Bastion can have more than one Garden. Each time you add a Garden to your Bastion, choose its type from the options in the Garden Types table. While in your Bastion, you can instruct the facility's hireling to change the Garden from one type to another. This work takes 21 days, during which time no other activity can occur in this facility. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Harvest: Garden Growth When you issue the "Harvest" order to this facility, you commission the facility's hireling to collect items from the Garden as noted in the Garden Types table. The work takes 7 days and costs no money. **Garden Types** | Garden Type | Description | Harvest |


|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Decorative | Aesthetically pleasing garden full of flowers and topiaries. | Ten exquisite floral bouquets (worth 5 GP each), ten vials of [[perfume-xphb (items)]], or ten [[Candle Xphb]] |
| Food | Garden of delicious mushrooms or vegetables | 100 days worth of [[rations-xphb (items)]] |
| Herb | Garden of rare herbs, some of which have medicinal uses | Herbs that are used to create either ten [[healers-kit-xphb (items)]] or one [[Potion of Healing Xdmg]] |
| Poison | Garden stocked with plants and fungi from which poisons and antitoxin can be extracted | Plants that are used to create either two vials of [[antitoxin-xphb (items)]] or one vial of [[Basic Poison Xphb]] |

^garden-types ## Enlarging the Facility You can enlarge your Garden to a Vast facility by spending 2,000 GP. A Vast Garden is equivalent to two Roomy Gardens and can include two of the same type of Garden or two different types. When you issue the Harvest order to a Vast Garden, each component garden produces its own harvest. A Vast Garden gains one additional hireling. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 340* ## Player-Facing Summary Garden is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of garden as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around garden. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Second Prophecy of Stars ## Plot Hooks - A noble needs help delivering before the festival
