## Overview
Old Valdris exists in a massive air bubble, perfectly preserved as it was in the moments before [[The Great Drowning]]. The city's 50,000 inhabitants are frozen in time, caught mid-action in their daily lives, turned to living crystal. The bubble is maintained by the collective dying wish of the population, and walking through the streets means witnessing the last moments of a civilization. Time moves strangely here - visitors age rapidly in some areas while becoming frozen in others.

### The Merchant Quarter
Traders frozen mid-transaction, coins hanging in the air between hands. [[The Crystal Merchant]] still moves, somehow immune to the freezing, trading in temporal fragments.

### The Noble Heights
Wealthy district where a grand ball was in progress. Dancers frozen mid-step, musicians with instruments raised. [[Lady Vivienne the Unfrozen]] still dances alone among the statues.

### The Common Wells
Working class area where people were drawing the last water before the flood. The water in the wells shows visions of what could have been.

### The Temple District
Priests frozen in prayer, some reaching toward the ceiling as if seeing the water coming. [[The Last Priest]] kneels at the altar, tears of crystal on his face.

### The Scholar's Row
Library and academy where students and teachers are frozen reading books about avoiding catastrophe. The books still turn their own pages.

### The Fast Lanes
Streets where time moves at 100x speed - crossing ages visitors by years.

### The Slow Gardens
Parks where time nearly stops - flowers frozen mid-bloom for centuries.

### The Loop Market
Shopping area caught in a 5-minute time loop, replaying the same moments forever.

### The Backward Bridge
Bridge where time reverses - injuries heal but memories are erased.

## The Crystallized Citizens
The frozen inhabitants are aware but cannot move or speak. Their eyes follow visitors, and those who touch them experience the person's last thoughts and emotions. Some visitors report hearing whispers when alone.

### King Marcus the Final
Frozen on his throne, crown halfway fallen from his head, reaching toward a map showing escape routes that were never used.

### The Crying Child
A young girl frozen mid-sob in the market square. Those who touch her are overwhelmed with prophetic visions of the drowning.

### The Warning Runner
A messenger frozen mid-sprint, mouth open in a shout of warning that never finished. His message scroll floats just beyond his fingertips.
