## Description
An old staple, one of the four universal [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Diversions/Games/Games|games]] which are common across the known planes, dice are used for a number of purposes ranging from bar-entertainment and gambling to fantasy gaming. I ship my dice in from Turmish, where they are carved from high-grade ivory in standard six-sided, and multi-sided versions. 

Four six-sided dice with leather dice cup. 3 sp.
