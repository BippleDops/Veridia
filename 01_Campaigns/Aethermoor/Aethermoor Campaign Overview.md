# Aethermoor Campaign Overview
## The Plague of Crystals & The Seven Shards

> *"In crystal's gleam, a deeper dream,*
> *Where surface thoughts and depths convene.*
> *Seven shards to hold apart,*
> *What beats within a dual heart."*
> — The Convergence Prophecy

## Campaign Premise

The kingdom of Aethermoor faces a mysterious crystal plague that transforms citizens into crystalline statues. What begins as a medical crisis reveals itself as the first symptom of a dimensional convergence with [[Aquabyssos]], the drowned realm that exists parallel to the surface world. The party must navigate political intrigue, body horror, and impossible choices as two worlds collide.

## Current World State

### The Crystal Plague
- **Duration**: 3 weeks and spreading
- **Affected**: 500+ citizens of [[Port Meridian]]
- **Symptoms**: Crystalline transformation, shared nightmares, psychic resonance
- **True Nature**: Dimensional frequency harmonization

### Political Landscape
- **[[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]**: Secretly fighting possession by Aquabyssos entity
- **[[The Crimson Hand]]**: Magical faction seeking to control the transformation
- **[[Purist Coalition]]**: Anti-magic faction growing violent
- **[[Silverscale Consortium]]**: Profiting from chaos while preparing to flee
- **[[The Crown Authority]]**: Fragmenting as Queen withdraws

### The Seven Shards Mystery
Ancient artifacts that maintain the dimensional barrier between Aethermoor and [[Aquabyssos]]. Each shard is held by a different faction, unaware of their true purpose. One shard is not an object but a living bloodline.
