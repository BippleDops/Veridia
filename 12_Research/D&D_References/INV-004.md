# INV-004

*"Investigation 004: The case that changed everything we thought we knew."*

## Overview
INV-004 refers to the fourth major investigation conducted by inter-realm authorities into anomalous activities affecting both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. This particular case involved the mysterious disappearance of diplomatic personnel from both realms during routine trade negotiations, leading to discoveries about corruption networks operating across dimensional boundaries.

## Historical Background
Launched following the failure of three previous investigations to uncover the truth behind increasing diplomatic incidents, INV-004 was granted unprecedented authority to operate in both realms simultaneously.

## Current State
The investigation remains officially ongoing, though its findings have already led to significant changes in inter-realm security protocols and diplomatic procedures.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
- High-level authorization from both realm governments
- Access to classified diplomatic records
- Specialized investigation techniques for inter-dimensional crimes
- Coordination between surface and underwater law enforcement

### Effects
- **Truth Revelation**: Uncovers hidden corruption networks
- **Policy Changes**: Results in new security measures
- **Political Consequences**: Affects diplomatic relationships
- **Ongoing Ramifications**: Creates new adventure opportunities

## Adventure Hooks
1. **New Evidence**: Characters discover information relevant to INV-004
2. **Cover-up Attempt**: Someone tries to suppress the investigation's findings
3. **Related Incident**: Similar pattern emerges requiring investigation

## Secrets (DM Only)
INV-004 uncovered evidence that some diplomatic incidents were orchestrated by entities from neither realm, suggesting external interference in inter-realm relations.

## Campaign Use
Provides framework for mystery adventures involving political intrigue and inter-dimensional crime.

## Player-Facing Summary

INV 004 is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

Legends speak of INV 004 as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around INV 004.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
