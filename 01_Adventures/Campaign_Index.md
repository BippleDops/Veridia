## ðŸ”§ Performance Notes

> [!info] Index Optimization
> - This index uses Dataview queries with limits to prevent performance issues
> - Large tables are collapsed by default
> - Consider archiving content older than 6 months
> - Run vault optimization monthly

### Vault Health Check
- **Total Files**: `$= dv.pages().length`
- **Total Markdown Files**: `$= dv.pages().where(p => p.file.ext == "md").length`
- **Files Over 100KB**: `$= dv.pages().where(p => p.file.size > 100000).length`
- **Orphaned Files**: `$= dv.pages().where(p => p.file.inlinks.length == 0 && p.file.outlinks.length == 0).length`
