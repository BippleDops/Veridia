# Surface Traders

*"Profit flows wherever currents carry willing merchants."*

## Overview
The Surface Traders are a consortium of merchants who specialize in the dangerous but lucrative business of trading between Aquabyssos and the surface world. Despite official restrictions and political tensions, they maintain secret trade routes and relationships.

Operating in legal gray areas, they provide access to surface goods that many in Aquabyssos desire but cannot legally obtain through official channels.
