## Overview
The Order of the Shattered Crown has discovered that each party member bears an invisible "Seal"â€”a magical mark that connects them to one of the Seven Shards. These Seals are awakening, granting power but also making them targets for those who would use them to reunite the Crown of Stars. The party must decide whether to embrace, remove, or master these marks before they consume them.

## Quest Hook
[[The Crimson Sage|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]] appears to each party member in individual visions, revealing glowing marks on their souls that pulse in rhythm with distant Shards. He warns that others have noticed these Seals and are coming to claim themâ€”by persuasion or force. The party must meet him at the Shattered Sanctum within three days.

### Personal Manifestations
Each party member experiences unique symptoms based on their Seal:

**Seal of Authority (Crystal Throne Shard):**
- People unconsciously defer to them
- Can sense lies and deception
- Dreams of ruling vast kingdoms
- Crystalline crown appears in reflections

**Seal of Conviction (Amber Shard):**
- Absolute certainty in beliefs
- Immunity to fear and charm
- Visions of purging corruption
- Eyes glow amber when passionate

**Seal of Passion (Crimson Shard):**
- Emotions affect environment (temperature, lighting)
- Can sense others' deepest desires
- Dreams of blood and fire
- Heartbeat synchronizes with nearby Shard

**Seal of Nature (Verdant Shard):**
- Plants grow in their footsteps
- Can communicate with natural spirits
- Feel physical pain from environmental damage
- Skin shows bark-like patterns

**Seal of Knowledge (Azure Shard):**
- Access to random ancient memories
- Can read any language temporarily
- Overwhelming influx of information
- Third eye appears in moments of insight

**Seal of Shadow (Shadow Shard):**
- Can step partially into shadow plane
- Become invisible in darkness
- Shadow independently moves
- Dreams are shared with shadow entities

**Seal of Balance (Seventh Shard):**
- Can sense other Seal bearers
- Temporary access to all other Seal powers
- Visions of the Crown's creation
- Body shows fractal crystal patterns

### The Shattered Sanctum Meeting
**The Crimson Sage's Revelation:**
- He is actually Aetheron, god of magic, in mortal form
- The Seals were his failsafe when creating the Crown
- Each Seal bearer can claim their connected Shard
- Together, they could reform or destroy the Crown
- But others know this secret now

**The Order's Position:**
- [[Sister Morwyn Veilkeeper|02 Worldbuilding/People/Sister Morwyn Veilkeeper]] advocates for balance
- Some members want to use party to gather Shards
- Others believe Seals should be destroyed
- Internal faction led by Brother Matthias plans betrayal

### The Hunter's Mark
