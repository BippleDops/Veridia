# Depth Survival Mechanics
## Complete Aquabyssos Survival System

> *"The depths change you. First your body, then your mind, finally your soul."*

## üåä Core Survival Systems

### Pressure System

#### Depth Zones & Effects

| Depth Range | Zone Name | Base DC | Pressure Effects |
|-------------|-----------|---------|------------------|
| 0-100 ft | Surface Zone | 10 | None |
| 100-500 ft | Twilight Zone | 12 | Disadvantage on Perception |
| 500-1,000 ft | Pressure Zone | 14 | 1 exhaustion/hour without protection |
| 1,000-3,000 ft | Crush Zone | 16 | 1d6 pressure damage/10 min |
| 3,000-6,000 ft | Abyss Zone | 18 | 2d6 pressure damage/10 min |
| 6,000-10,000 ft | Hadal Zone | 20 | 3d6 pressure damage/10 min |
| 10,000+ ft | Void Zone | 22+ | 4d6 pressure damage + special |

#### Pressure Saves
```
Constitution Save: DC = 10 + (Depth in thousands of feet)
Failure Effects:
- 1st Failure: 1 level exhaustion
- 2nd Failure: Speed halved
- 3rd Failure: Incapacitated
- 4th Failure: Unconscious
- 5th Failure: Death (implosion)
```

### üß¨ Adaptation System

#### Adaptation Points (AP)
Characters accumulate AP through exposure to depths:

```
AP Gain Rate:
- Natural exposure: 1 AP per 24 hours at depth
- Forced adaptation: 1 AP per failed pressure save
- Magical adaptation: Variable based on source
- Crystal exposure: 1 AP per corruption level
```

#### Adaptation Stages

| AP Range | Stage | Physical Changes | Mechanical Effects |
|----------|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| 0-10 | Surface Normal | None | Standard character |
| 11-25 | Early Adaptation | Slight webbing, pale skin | Hold breath x2 duration |
| 26-50 | Aquatic Transition | Gills forming, scales appearing | Water breathing 1 hr/day, Swim speed 20 ft |
| 51-75 | Deep Dweller | Full gills, bioluminescent patches | Permanent water breathing, Darkvision 60 ft |
| 76-99 | Pressure Evolved | Translucent skin, visible organs | Resistance to pressure damage, Telepathy 30 ft |
| 100+ | Fully Transformed | Alien appearance, barely human | Immunity to pressure, Cannot return to surface |

#### Adaptation Benefits & Drawbacks

**Benefits by Stage:**
- **Stage 1**: +1 to CON saves underwater
- **Stage 2**: Advantage on swimming checks
- **Stage 3**: No need for pressure suits to 3,000 ft
- **Stage 4**: Pressure damage reduced by half
- **Stage 5**: Regenerate 1 hp/hour underwater
- **Stage 6**: Pressure immunity, +2 CON

**Drawbacks by Stage:**
- **Stage 1**: -1 to CHA with surface dwellers
- **Stage 2**: Sunlight sensitivity (disadvantage in bright light)
- **Stage 3**: Must submerge in water every 4 hours
- **Stage 4**: Cannot breathe air without apparatus
- **Stage 5**: -4 CHA with non-adapted, alien appearance
- **Stage 6**: Permanent transformation, surface = death

### üåë Shadow Independence System

#### Shadow Autonomy Levels

| Level | Shadow Behavior | Trigger Condition | Control DC |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|------------|
| 0 | Normal | Standard shadow | N/A |
| 1 | Twitching | Failed WIS save in Aquabyssos | DC 10 WIS to control |
| 2 | Delayed | Moves 1 second after owner | DC 12 WIS to sync |
| 3 | Independent Movement | High stress or fear | DC 14 WIS to command |
| 4 | Conscious | Makes different gestures | DC 16 WIS to suppress |
| 5 | Rebellious | Actively opposes owner | DC 18 WIS to override |
| 6 | Fully Autonomous | Can separate from owner | DC 20 WIS to prevent separation |

#### Shadow Separation Consequences
```
When shadow achieves full autonomy:
- Owner loses 2 STR permanently
- Shadow becomes corporeal at night
- Shadow knows all owner's secrets
- Can be bargained with or fought
- If killed: Owner has no shadow ever
- If integrated: Gain shadow powers
```

### üíß Breathing Medium Transitions

#### Water-Air Interfaces
Special zones where neither air nor water breathing works properly:

| Interface Type | Breathing Difficulty | Required Save | Failure Effect |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Bubble Zones | Half effectiveness | CON DC 12 | 1 exhaustion |
| Pressure Mist | -5 to breath duration | CON DC 14 | Choking |
| Liquid Air | Roll twice, take lower | CON DC 15 | Drowning in air |
| Solid Water | Cannot breathe | CON DC 18 | Suffocation |

### üß† Depth Sickness

#### Ascending Consequences
Rising toward surface causes mental/physical breakdown:

```
Ascension Rate Penalties:
- 100 ft/hour: No effect
- 500 ft/hour: DC 12 CON save or confused
- 1,000 ft/hour: DC 15 CON save or 1d6 psychic damage

## Player-Facing Summary

Depth Survival Mechanics is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Depth Survival Mechanics as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens‚Äîshifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind‚Äîthat herald change around Depth Survival Mechanics.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Depth Survival Mechanics to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at Depth Survival Mechanics to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to Depth Survival Mechanics active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
