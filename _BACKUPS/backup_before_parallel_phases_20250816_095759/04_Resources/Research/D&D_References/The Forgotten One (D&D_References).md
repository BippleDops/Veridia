--- > [!figure] View # The Forgotten One *"In the deepest trenches where light has never touched, something waits that memory itself refuses to acknowledge."* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview The Forgotten One is not truly a location in the conventional sense - it exists as both a physical presence and a conceptual void deep within the [[Aquabyssos trenches. This ancient entity or artifact defies description, existing in a state that actively erases itself from memory and record even as observers experience it. The site represents one of the most dangerous and enigmatic mysteries in the deep ocean realm. What makes The Forgotten One truly terrifying is not its power, but its nature: it exists in a state of active forgetting. Those who encounter it find their memories of the experience fading even as it happens, leaving only fragments, impressions, and an overwhelming sense that something monumentally important has been lost forever. The location shifts between being a sentient entity, an ancient ruin, a temporal anomaly, and pure conceptual void. Scholars theorize it may be a remt of a civilization so ancient that reality itself has forgotten their existence, leaving only this paradoxical trace of what once was. ### The Approach The journey to The Forgotten One begins in the [The Hadal Depths]], where the ocean floor drops away into trenches that seem to extend beyond physical possibility. As explorers descend, they notice their equipment beginning to malfunction - not broken, but operating in ways that feel somehow wrong. **Environmental Changes**:

- **Memory Fog**: A supernatural mist that causes explorers to forget why they came
- **Temporal Slippage**: Time moves inconsistently, with minutes feeling like hours or vice versa
- **Reality Drift**: Physical laws begin operating by different, forgotten principles
- **Emotional Void**: Progressive loss of the ability to feel or form new memories
- **Documentation Failure**: Written records begin changing or erasing themselves **Navigation Hazards**:
- **The Forgetting Current**: Water that flows upward, carrying away thoughts and intentions
- **Memory Whirlpools**: Vortices of water that drain mental capacity instead of physical objects
- **Concept Reefs**: Coral-like formations made of crystallized forgotten ideas
- **Paradox Trenches**: Chasms that exist but cannot be perceived directly
- ** Pressure Zones**: Areas where water pressure exists as a negative concept ### The Site Itself The Forgotten One manifests differently to each observer, but common elements include: **Physical Characteristics**:

- **Size**: Appears to be simultaneously massive and intimately small
- **Shape**: Constantly shifting between recognizable architectural forms and pure abstraction
- **Material**: Composed of what appears to be crystallized memory or fossilized thought
- **Color**: Described as "the color of things you can't remember" - typically a shifting void
- **Temperature**: Neither warm nor cold, but somehow "forgotten temperature" **Architectural Elements** (when perceivable):
- **Impossible Geometries**: Structures that violate fundamental principles of space
- **Memory Halls**: Corridors lined with empty picture frames and blank books
- **The Void Chamber**: A central space that actively resists observation
- **Temporal Stairways**: Steps that lead to different time periods
- **The Forgetting Pool**: A basin of liquid that may contain all lost memories ### How It Works The Forgotten One operates on principles that seem to predate current reality. Its influence affects different aspects of existence: **Memory Erasure Mechanics**:

**Summary**: How It Works The Forgotten One operates on principles that seem to predate current reality. Its influence affects different aspects of existence: **Memory Erasure Mechanics**: - Key information at a glance.

- **Active Forgetting**: Memories don't just fade - they are actively removed
- **Retroactive Nonexistence**: Things touched by its influence become as if they never were
- **Concept Void**: Abstract ideas and relationships are dissolved
- **Identity Dissolution**: Prolonged exposure erases sense of self
- **Reality Revision**: The universe adjusts itself to accommodate the absence of forgotten things **Stages of Exposure**: **Stage 1 - Peripheral Forgetting** (0-10 minutes):
- Minor memory lapses and confusion
- Difficulty recalling recent events
- Equipment malfunction begins
- Save vs. Wisdom **DC 12** or lose memory of last hour **Stage 2 - Active Erasure** (10-30 minutes):
- Significant memory loss affecting past day
- Identity confusion begins
- Physical sensations become unreliable
- Save vs. Wisdom **DC 15** or lose memory of last week **Stage 3 - Deep Forgetting** (30-60 minutes):
- Major life memories begin disappearing
- Companions may be forgotten entirely
- Basic skills and knowledge fade
- Save vs. Wisdom **DC 18** or lose memory of last year **Stage 4 - Conceptual Void** (1+ hours):
- Language and abstract thought deteriorate
- Basic identity dissolves
- Risk of complete personality erasure
- Save vs. Wisdom **DC 21** or lose core identity permanently **Stage 5 - Total Nonexistence** (2+ hours):
- Complete erasure from memory and reality
- Other people forget the person ever existed
- No save - permanent removal from existence
- Only divine intervention or wish magic can restore ### Natural Protections The Forgotten One has evolved (or was designed with) multiple layers of protection: **Memory Barriers**:

- **Selective Amnesia**: Important details about the site are automatically forgotten
- **Misdirection Fields**: Cause explorers to unconsciously avoid the area
- **False Memory Implantation**: Replace true memories with harmless substitutes
- **Temporal Displacement**: Cause visitors to arrive at different times than intended
- **Reality Anchors**: Prevent magical divination or scrying **Guardian Entities**:
- **The Unnamed**: Beings that exist but cannot be remembered or described
- **Memory Wraiths**: Spirits composed of forgotten experiences
- **Void Swimmers**: Creatures that phase in and out of existence
- **Echo Servants**: Entities that repeat forgotten conversations and events
- **The Last Witness**: A singular guardian that remembers what others cannot ### Protective Equipment Specialized gear developeded for exploration, with limited success: **Memory Anchors**: Magical items that preserve core memories (50% success rate)

**Reality Tethers**: Devices that maintain connection to baseline reality
**Forgetting Suits**: Protective gear that delays memory loss effects
**Truth Stones**: Crystals that record experiences that can't be remembered
**Identity Totems**: Personal items that help maintain sense of self ### The First Survey (Historical) **Date**: Unknown (records deliberately obscured)

**Leader**: [[Navigator Sage Driftwood
**Size**: Estimated 12-person team
**Outcome**: Only Navigator Driftwood returned, with no memory of the expedition
**Evidence**: Driftwood's journal contains blank pages dated during the missing period
**Legacy**: Standard protocols for deep trench exploration developed ### The Academic Expedition **Date**: Three years ago (specific date forgotten)

**Leader**: [Archivist Vera Glowmind]]
**Purpose**: Systematic study and documentation
**Size**: 8 researchers with full magical support
**Outcome**: 3 researchers returned with partial memories
**Discoveries**: Confirmed the site's active nature and memory-affecting properties
**Cost**: 5 researchers lost to complete forgetting
**Documentation**: 47 blank research journals and one incomprehensible artifact ### The Treasure Seekers **Date**: Last year (month uncertain)

**Leader**: Unknown (name forgotten)
**Purpose**: Believed to be seeking ancient artifacts
**Size**: Unknown
**Outcome**: Unknown - no evidence they ever existed
**Evidence**: Strange gaps in harbor departure logs
**Mystery**: Several families in [[Port Meridian have rooms prepared for people they can't remember ### The Divine Mission **Date**: Six months ago

**Leader**: [Battle Priest Cassius Depthshield]]
**Purpose**: Attempted exorcism or cleansing of the site
**Size**: 4 battle clerics and 2 paladins
**Outcome**: All returned, but claim they never left the city
**Anomaly**: Divine magic detected significant conflict, but no memories remain
**Consequence**: The priests now preach sermons about concepts they can't define ### Academic Theories **The Forgotten Civilization Hypothesis**

- The site represents ruins of a pre-cataclysmic civilization
- Their technology or magic involved memory manipulation
- The Great Drowning may causeded by their experiments with forgetting
- Cross-references with [[Memoriam **The Conceptual Weapon Theory**
- Created as a weapon that attacks memory and identity
- Designed to erase enemies from history itself
- May useded during ancient wars between realms
- Potentially still active and waiting for commands **The Natural Phenomenon Explanation**
- Result of unique magical conditions in the deep trenches
- Intersection of temporal and memory-affecting magical fields
- May be growing stronger over time
- Could represent a fundamental flaw in reality itself **The Divine Remt Theory**
- Remains of a god or powerful entity that chose to be forgotten
- Self-imposed exile from memory and reality
- May contain divine power that could reshape existence
- Connected to [Angels and Depths]] mythological cycles ### Mystical Interpretations **The Memory Farmers** believe the site is a natural harvesting ground where forgotten memories accumulate over time, making it potentially valuable for their operations. **The Recursion Cult** claims the site exists in all possible realities simultaneously, making it a nexus point for their dimensional activities. **Temple scholars** theorize it may be a test or trial created by divine powers, designed to teach about the nature of existence and identity. ### Physical Dangers **Pressure Anomalies**

- Water pressure fluctuates unpredictably

- **Mechanical Effect**: Casters take `dice: 1d6` psychic damage per spell level when casting divination magic **Reality Anchor Disruption**
- Magical effects that rely on consistent reality may fail
- Teleportation magic becomes extremely dangerous
- Summoning spells may bring entities from forgotten realms
- **Mechanical Effect**: Teleportation has 50% chance to transport to random location ### Scholarly Community The existence of The Forgotten One has created significant divisions within [[Aquabyssos's academic community: **The Remembrance Faction** believes the site must be studied despite the dangers, arguing that forgotten knowledge may be crucial to understanding the realm's history. **The Forgetting Faction** advocates for complete avoidance, claiming that some things are forgotten for good reason and should remain so. **The Memorial Society** works to maintain records of those lost to the site, creating redundant documentation and memory preservation rituals. ### Religious Implications Various religious orders have developed different doctrines regarding The Forgotten One: **Orthodox Position**: The site represents divine punishment for hubris, and mortals should not interfere with divine judgment. **Reform Movement**: Believes the site may contain divine revelation that could transform understanding of existence and memory. **Heretical Sects**: Worship the concept of forgetting itself, seeing it as a path to liberation from painful memories and identity. ### Legal Status The [Parliament of Echoes]] has established specific laws regarding The Forgotten One: - **Expedition Licensing**: All approaches require government permits (rarely granted)

- **Information Suppression**: Public discussion of specific details is discouraged
- **Victim Compensation**: Families of those lost receive state support
- **Research Restrictions**: Academic study requires multiple oversight committees
- **Emergency Protocols**: Established procedures for memory loss events ### Low-Level Adventures (Levels 1-4) **The Missing Memories**

A local family insists they had another member, but no one else remembers this person. Investigation leads to evidence of The Forgotten One's influence reaching into the city. **The Blank Journal**

An explorer returns from the deep trenches with a journal full of detailed drawings and notes that become blank when anyone tries to read them. **The Unnamed Ship**

A vessel arrives in port with a crew that can't remember where they've been or what cargo they were carrying, but their ship shows signs of deep-trench exploration. ### Mid-Level Adventures (Levels 5-9) **The Memory Merchant**

Someone is selling memories that may recovereded from The Forgotten One, but the memories contain dangerous knowledge that affects reality itself. **The Recursive Expedition**

The party discovers evidence that they themselves led an expedition to The Forgotten One, but none of them remember it happening. **The Identity Crisis**

Citizens of [[Port Meridian begin forgetting fundamental aspects of themselves, suggesting The Forgotten One's influence is spreading. ### High-Level Adventures (Levels 10+) **The Great Remembering**

A plan emerges to use powerful magic to remember everything The Forgotten One has erased, potentially restoring lost civilizations but risking reality collapse. **The Final Expedition**

The party must venture to The Forgotten One to prevent it from expanding its influence and erasing the entire realm from existence. **The Paradox War**

Conflict erupts between those who want to preserve The Forgotten One and those who want to destroy it, with the outcome determining the nature of memory itself. ### Hidden Truths **The Deliberate Creation**

The Forgotten One was not accidental - created it an ancient civilization as their ultimate legacy, ensuring they would be remembered by being forgotten. **The Growing Influence**

The site's memory-affecting power is slowly expanding, and may eventually encompass all of [Aquabyssos]] if left unchecked. **The Memory Prison**

All forgotten memories may still exist within The Forgotten One, trapped in a conceptual space that could potentially be accessed. **The Guardian Identity**

The Last Witness, the site's primary guardian, may actually be the collective consciousness of everyone who has ever been forgotten by the site. ### Ongoing Mysteries **The Temporal Loop**

**Summary**: Ongoing Mysteries **The Temporal Loop** - Key information at a glance.

Evidence suggests some expeditions to the site may be occurring in recursive time loops, with the same people forgetting and rediscovering the location repeatedly. **The Reality Anchor**

Something is preventing The Forgotten One from erasing itself entirely - this anchor point may be the key to understanding and potentially controlling the site. **The Missing Civilization Records**

Historical documents contain gaps that suggest an entire civilization eraseded from history, and The Forgotten One may be all that remains of them. **The Divine Connection**

Certain divine magic works differently near the site, suggesting it may have connections to deities that have themselves been forgotten. --- *In the deepest places where light fears to venture, The Forgotten One waits - not malevolently, but with the patient persistence of entropy itself. It reminds us that memory, identity, and existence itself are more fragile than we dare believe, and that some knowledge comes at the price of forgetting who we were when we sought it.* ## Player-Facing Summary The Forgotten One is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Forgotten One as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Forgotten One. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Plot Hooks - Someone is hunting a artifact for love

- Someone is searching for a witness for love
- A letter reveals ancient history about this place
- The authorities needs help investigating before the festival ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
