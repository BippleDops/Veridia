While you wave the pent, the symbol on it glitters, and the pent sheds bright light in a 10-foot-radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. *Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 39* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Strixhaven pent scc is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
