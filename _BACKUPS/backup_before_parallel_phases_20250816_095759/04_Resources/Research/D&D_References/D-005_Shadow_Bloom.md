AC —; HP —; Area 300 ft radius; Saves: Sanity **DC 15** (group), Sensor **DC 16**

Effects: Dim bright light to dim; creates echo images; imposes Disadvantage on Perception relying on sight

Countermeasures: Anchor hymn (Religion **DC 14**) reduces DCs by 1 for duration ## Player-Facing Summary D 005 Shadow Bloom is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of D 005 Shadow Bloom as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around D 005 Shadow Bloom. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is blackmailing an heir for money
