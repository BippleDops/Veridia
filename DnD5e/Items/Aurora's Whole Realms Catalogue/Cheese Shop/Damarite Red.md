## Description
Bloodcheese from the lands of the Bloodstone, Damarite is made of goatâ€™s milk, giving it a sharper, heartier, more pungent tang. The cheese travels well in its heavy, black rind. Not recommended in large quantities, Damarite Red provides that excellent accent of a snack cheese. Available in 1 lb wheels (5 sp) or 50 lb oblong wheys (20 gp).
