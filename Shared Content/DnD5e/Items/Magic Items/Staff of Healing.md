## Description
This [[Staff|staff]] has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] and [[7 - Spellcasting|spellcasting]] ability modifier: **[[Cure Wounds|cure wounds]]** (1 charge per [[1 - What Is a Spell_|spell level]], up to 4th), **[[Lesser Restoration|lesser restoration]]** (2 charges), or **[[Mass Cure Wounds|mass cure wounds]]** (5 charges).
