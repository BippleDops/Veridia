## Description
Some of the nicest spots in Faerun are under ice for most of the year; in others the summer never ends. Those who adventure to such spots will want a horse blanket and hood to protect their mounts from wintery blasts, and a fly net for turning back the biting bugs of summer. Our blanket and hood (3 gp) attach together, but can be separated for more temperate climes. Both are made of thick wool to keep the horse as snug as a lamb. Our fly net (2 gp) is made of fine leather for durability and includes tassels to warn off even the nastiest bugs.
