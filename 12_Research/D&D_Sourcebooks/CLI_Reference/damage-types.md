# Damage Types
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 196. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.1)'>SRD</span> and the Basic Rules (2014)* 

## Acid

The corrosive spray of a black dragon's breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.

## Bludgeoning

Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.

## Cold

The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil's spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon's breath deal cold damage.

## Fire

Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.

## Force

Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.

## Lightning

A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon's breath deal lightning damage.

## Necrotic

Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and some spells, withers matter and even the soul.

## Piercing

Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters' bites, deal piercing damage.

## Poison

Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon's breath deal poison damage.

## Psychic

Mental abilities such as a mind flayer's psionic blast deal psychic damage.

## Radiant

Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric's flame strike spell or an angel's smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.

## Slashing

Swords, axes, and monsters' claws deal slashing damage.

## Thunder

A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.

## Player-Facing Summary

Damage types is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of damage types as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around damage types.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties damage types to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at damage types to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to damage types active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
