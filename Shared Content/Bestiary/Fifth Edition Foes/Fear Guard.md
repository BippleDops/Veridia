## Special Traits
**Create Spawn:** Any living creature slain by a fear guard has tactical disadvantage on its death saving throws. If it dies, it will rise again as a fear guard under the control of its killer `dice: 1d6` rounds later.

**Daylight Vulnerability:** A fear guard suffers 7 (`dice: 2d6`) points of radiant damage if it is exposed to true sunlight (not magical sunlight or artificial, bright light) at the start of its turn, and it is slowed (as the spell) until the start of its next turn.

**Incorporeal:** A fear guard can move through solid objects and other creatures as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (`dice: 1d1`)0 force damage if it is still inside something solid at the end of its turn.

**Shadow Stealth:** If the fear guard ends its turn in dim light or darkness, it can use a bonus action to make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to become hidden, with tactical advantage on the check. Because it is incorporeal and all of its movement is flight, it makes very little sound when moving and never leaves footprints or disturbs dust on the floor.

**Spell-like Abilities:** A fear guard can use the following spell-like abilities, using Charisma as its casting ability (DC 14, attack +6). The fear lord doesn’t need material components to use these abilities.

- At Will: *darkness, ray of enfeeblement*

- 2/day: *inflict wounds (as 2nd-level slot)*

## Actions
**Greatsword:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (`dice: 2d6+3`) necrotic damage and the target must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or its maximum hit points are reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Underground

**Organization**: Solitary or group (2–5)

## Description
Fear guards embody the ultimate joining of evil and loyalty. They are summoned from some unknown place by evil wizards and clerics to guard prized possessions or valued locations, and they serve that duty with the unwavering singlemindedness and eternal patience of the undead.

Shrouding themselves in preternatural darkness, fear guards fight using their life-draining greatswords and life-sapping magic. Because of their ability to spawn additional fear guards under their control, a location guarded by a single fear guard can become more secure as time goes by and grave robbers who fall to the fear guard’s attacks join its ranks. If somehow exposed to natural sunlight, fear guards wrap themselves in magical darkness if they can. If they can’t, they flee toward safety. Sunlight is the only force that can cause a fear guard to abandon its post.
