_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_ The region around a shadow dragon's lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects: - **Negative Energy Suffusion.** Whenever a creature within 1 mile of the lair regains [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules) from a spell, it subtracts`d10`from the number of [hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] regained. - **Stifling Shadows.** Within 1 mile of the lair, effects that normally create [[Light Xphb instead create [Light Xphb]], and creatures there have [[Advantage Xphb on Dexterity ([skills#Stealth|Stealth]]) checks. If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. ## Player-Facing Summary Shadow dragon xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of shadow dragon xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around shadow dragon xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Alliance - Manipulate succession ## Plot Hooks - An heirloom has gone missing and war looms
