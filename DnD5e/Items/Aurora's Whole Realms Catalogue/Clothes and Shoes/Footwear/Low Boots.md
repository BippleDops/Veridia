## Description
Similar in style and construction to the [[High Boots|high boots]], these come up only to mid-shin, so thereâ€™s not quite as much weight to lug around. Hard low boots sell for 2 gp, while soft ones are 15 sp a pair. Again, animal skin low boots are available at 3 gp/pair, and also the same option of dagger sheaths at 1 gp each.
