# Silver Mask
*The Phantom Agent of Aethermoor's Hidden Networks*

> *"They say Silver Mask has been everyone and no one, a ghost that walks among us wearing the faces of our trusted friends, our respected leaders, our beloved family members. In thirty years of investigation, I have uncovered seventeen different identities that might be Silver Mask, only to discover that each was merely another layer in an infinite conspiracy of deception. The truth is not that Silver Mask is hard to find - it's that Silver Mask might be everyone we think we can trust."*
> â€” [[Investigative Chronicler Darius Truthseeker]], "Phantom Investigations: The Silver Mask Files"
