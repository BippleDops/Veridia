# Hat of Wizardry
*Wondrous item, common (requires attunement by a wizard)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/hat-of-wizardry.webp#right)


This cone-shaped hat is adorned with moons and stars. While you are wearing it, you gain the following benefits.

## Spellcasting Focus

You can use the hat as a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/spellcasting-focus-xphb|Spellcasting Focus]] for your Wizard spells.

## Unknown Spell

As a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you can try to cast a cantrip that you don't know. The cantrip must be on the Wizard spell list and have a casting time of an action, and you make a DC 10 Intelligence ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Arcana|Arcana]]) check. On a successful check, you cast the spell. On a failed check, the spell fails, and the action used to cast the spell is wasted. In either case, you can't use this property again until you finish a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]].
