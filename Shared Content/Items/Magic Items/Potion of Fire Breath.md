# Potion of Diminution

## Overview
**Type**: Magic Item

**Group**: *Potions*

**Rarity**: *Uncommon*


## Description
After drinking this potion, you can use a bonus action to exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 13 [[Dexterity]] [[saving throw]], taking `dice: 4d6` (4d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The effect ends after you exhale the fire three times or when 1 hour has passed. This potion's orange liquid flickers, and smoke fills the top of the container and wafts out whenever it is opened.
