These tiny birds were originally discovered among the subtropical islands of the south and were brought to the mainland to be bred as songbirds. Their numbers have flourished in captivity over the years, and it was eventually determined that they were useful in detecting dangerous gases in mines and caverns. Since that time, they have been widely employed by miners as sentinel animals to detect the presence of otherwise undetectable gas [[Appendix C - Hazards|hazards]] before the miners are overcome by them.
