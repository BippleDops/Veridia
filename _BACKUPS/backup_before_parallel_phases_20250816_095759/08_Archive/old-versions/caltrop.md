*Adventuring gear* - **Cost**: 5 cp
- **Weight**: 0.1 lbs. As an action, you can spread a single bag of caltrops to cover a 5-foot-square area. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a **DC 15** Dexterity saving throw or stop moving and take 1 piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the saving throw. *Source: Player's Handbook p. 151.
