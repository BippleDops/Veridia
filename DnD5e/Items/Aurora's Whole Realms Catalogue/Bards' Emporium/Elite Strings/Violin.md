## Description
Our violins are constructed in two cities of high culture: Waterdeep, Selgaunt. Elves particularly love violin music, and many of our craftsmen are elven. Even our lowest-price violins (65 gp) produce mellow tones and come with a leather case. Our masters-quality violins must be special ordered from a specific craftsman, and thus range in price and availability.
