The Carrion Court is an aristocratic hierarchy of undead beings that maintains the twisted traditions of an ancient noble court from beyond the grave. Led by **Lich-Queen Morwyn the Deathless**, this organization of vampires, liches, wraiths, and other powerful undead seeks to establish a kingdom where death is merely a transition to higher nobility rather than an ending. They operate with the pomp, ceremony, and political intrigue of a living court, but with the power and immortal patience of the undead. Additionally, ### Conversion Process

1. **The Courtship**: Extended period of testing and preparation
2. **The Choice**: Formal offer of eternal service and nobility
3. **The Transformation**: Ritual conversion to appropriate undead type
4. **The Investiture**: Formal ceremony granting court title and position ### The Great Nobility Project

> [!warning] DM Only
> The court is systematically identifying and converting the most influential noble families across multiple kingdoms, planning to replace living aristocracy with undead rulers within 50 years. ### The Eternal Archive

> A vast library containing the memories and knowledge of every being the court has converted to undeath, making them one of the most knowledgeable organizations in the world. ### The Blood Pact Network

> Secret agreements with living nobles ensuring their conversion to undeath upon natural death, in exchange for current protection and favor. ### Social Intrigue

1. **The Invitation**: Party receives formal invitation to court function
2. **Noble Impostor**: Undead noble assumes identity of living aristocrat
3. **The Inheritance Dispute**: Legal battle between living and undead claimants
4. **Diplomatic Mission**: Negotiate between living kingdom and undead court ### Investigation & Mystery

5. **The Vanishing Nobles**: Track disappearing aristocratic families
6. **The Blood Trade**: Investigate suspicious funeral home activities
7. **Corrupted Clergy**: Root out undead infiltrators in religious orders
8. **The False Death**: Determine if noble's death was natural or orchestrated ### Combat & Military

9. **Siege of the Bone Palace**: Direct assault on court headquarters
10. **The Undead Army**: Face military force led by death knights
11. **Vampire Hunt**: Track and eliminate specific court noble
12. **Necromantic Duel**: Magical combat with court's lich advisors ## Player-Facing Summary The Carrion Court is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Carrion Court as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Carrion Court. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Strange disappearances suggest a curse
