# Lunging Attack
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 95*  

As a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]], you can expend one Superiority Die and take the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Dash|Dash]] action. If you move at least 5 feet in a straight line immediately before hitting with a melee attack as part of the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Attack|Attack]] action on this turn, you can add the Superiority Die to the attack's damage roll.
