> Clerk's Note: Stamped and recorded at Port Meridian under the Tide-Quartermaster's seal.

## Visual Cues

- Ink: stormglass sheen; letters shimmer at angles
- Markings: seals, thumbprints, tally marks

## Usable Table Info
- Names, dates, and codes that can be entered into checks or puzzles

## GM Margin
- If forged: DC 15 Investigation to detect; failure moves story forward with suspicion clock +1
