**Vines:** *Melee Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature,. Hit: 21 (`dice: 3d10+5`) piercing damage. If both vine attacks hit the same target, the creature must make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled.

A webbed creature can use its action to attempt a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check to escape. The web can also be destroyed by 15 points of slashing or fire damage against AC 10.

## Description
Widow creepers are spiderlike plant creatures that make their lairs deep in tangled forests. When widow creepers are in a region, they are a constant danger to woodsmen, foresters, and other denizens of the forest.

Widow creepers spend much of their time in their nests, which are built of plant-fiber webs strung high in the trees and stretching to a diameter of 50 yards or more. When they venture out for food, however, they can cover a tremendous amount of territory in their lethal hunt.

A widow creeper sustains itself on a diet of brain fluid and blood. Corpses drained of fluids are left where they fell; the widow creeper does not devour the flesh, bones, or muscle of its prey.

A widow creeper looks like a giant (8 feet tall) black widow spider, but it is a plant, not an animal. Its body is formed from stems, small leaves, and tightly twisted vines, all dark green or brown in color. Two long, sinewy, tentacle-like vines protrude from its body and serve as both the creature’s primary weapons and its primary manipulative limbs.

A widow creeper utters no sounds; it is believed they neither speak nor understand any humanoid languages.
