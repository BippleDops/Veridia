--- # Frigid Water

*Environmental Hazard* A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a **DC 10** Constitution saving throw or gain 1 [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion level. Creatures with [boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats)]] or [[immunity-xphb (variant-rules)]] to Cold damage automatically succeed on the save, as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in ice-cold water. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 68* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Frigid water xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
