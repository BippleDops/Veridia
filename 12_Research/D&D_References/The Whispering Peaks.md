## Overview

The Whispering Peaks rise from the northern waters of [[Aquabyssos]] like the spines of some ancient, slumbering leviathan. These jagged mountains breach the surface in defiance of [[The Great Drowning]], their peaks shrouded in perpetual mist that carries the voices of countless souls who perished during the cataclysm. The winds here don't merely blow - they speak, carrying fragments of final words, dying prayers, and unfinished promises across the treacherous slopes.

This haunted archipelago serves as both sanctuary and prison for the [[Order of Azure Flame]], warrior-monks who have dedicated themselves to shepherding the restless dead and guarding against the whispers that threaten to drive visitors to madness.

### The Great Drowning Truth
The Order possesses evidence that the Great Drowning was not a natural disaster but a deliberate act of divine punishment. The spirits carry testimony that could expose those responsible.

### The Azure Flame's Origin
The eternal flame is actually powered by the concentrated regrets and unfulfilled promises of the living. Each person who visits and feels genuine remorse strengthens it.

### The Resurrection Ritual
Hidden in the deepest section of the Sunken Library is a complete ritual for reversing the Great Drowning, but it requires the willing sacrifice of everyone who has adapted to underwater life.

### The Spirit Army
The Order is secretly building an army of willing spirits who could be called upon to defend the living world against threats from [[The Hadal Depths]].

> [!tip] DM Note
> The Whispering Peaks serve as an excellent location for emotional storytelling, allowing characters to confront their past, communicate with lost loved ones, and grapple with themes of death, redemption, and memory. The constant spiritual activity provides ongoing plot hooks and can reveal information about any aspect of the campaign's history.

## Player-Facing Summary
