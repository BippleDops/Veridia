    "description": "The Shadow Warren's true appearance is a mystery, as they are never seen without their distinctive shadow-wreathed cloak that seems to shift and move independently. What can be discerned suggests a being profoundly altered by shadow corruption:\n\n**Height**: Approximately 5'8\", though their form seems to fluctuate  \n**Build**: Lean and wiry, with unnaturally elongated limbs  \n**Face**: Always hidden beneath a deep hood, with only occasional glimpses of pale, almost translucent skin  \n**Eyes**: Twin points of dim silver light that pierce through the darkness of their hood  \n**Voice**: A whisper that seems to come from multiple directions at once, with an echoing quality  \n**Distinguishing Features**:\n- Shadow tendrils that extend from their cloak, acting as extra limbs\n- Footsteps that make no sound, even on the loudest surfaces\n- A presence that causes nearby shadows to deepen and stretch toward them\n- Scars of crystalline corruption visible on their hands - the only part of their body regularly seen",
