# The Stolen Anvil

*"Without the Master's Anvil, true crafting dies in these waters." - Guildmaster Ironheart*

## Overview
The Stolen Anvil incident involves the theft of the legendary Deepforge Anvil, a magical smithing tool capable of creating underwater weapons and artifacts of unprecedented quality. The anvil's disappearance has crippled the city's crafting industry and created a black market for inferior goods.

## The Deepforge Anvil
**Origin:** Forged by the legendary smith Thalassic Ironbane centuries ago
**Properties:** Enables underwater metalworking, enhances magical item creation
**Size:** Massive - requires multiple people to move
**Value:** Priceless to crafters, estimated 50,000 gp replacement cost
**Unique Features:** Self-heating, water-resistant flames, increases success rates

## The Theft
**Location:** Master Smithy in the Crafters' Quarter
**Method:** Sophisticated magical teleportation during guild meeting
**Timing:** When all smiths were attending annual craftsmen's assembly
**Evidence:** Scorch marks and residual teleportation magic
**Suspects:** No witnesses, professional execution

## Investigation Progress
**Initial Response:** Guild hired private investigators
**Official Involvement:** City guard took over after pressure
**Magical Analysis:** Teleportation signature partially identified
**Interviews:** All guild members and rivals questioned
**Dead Ends:** Investigation stalled after three weeks

## Impact on Industry
**Production Decline:** Quality of smithed goods dropped significantly
**Economic Effects:** Prices increased, skilled smiths left city
**Guild Politics:** Internal disputes over replacement funding
**International Trade:** Aquabyssos lost competitive advantage
**Innovation Stagnation:** New techniques development halted

## Leading Theories
1. **Rival City Theft:** Competing underwater settlement sought advantage
2. **Corporate Espionage:** Merchant guild eliminated crafting competition
3. **Personal Vendetta:** Disgruntled former guild member seeking revenge
4. **Foreign Collection:** Surface world collector acquired exotic artifact
5. **Cult Activity:** Religious group needed anvil for prophetic weapon creation

## Current Situation
**Replacement Efforts:** Guild attempting to forge new anvil with limited success
**Black Market:** Inferior tools sold at premium prices
**Skill Migration:** Master crafters leaving for better opportunities
**Political Pressure:** Government demands resolution
**Underground Information:** Rumors of anvil sightings in distant locations

## Clues and Evidence
**Teleportation Residue:** Magic signature suggests expert spellcaster
**Timing Knowledge:** Thief knew exact schedule of guild meeting
**Professional Execution:** No evidence of amateur involvement
**No Ransom Demands:** Suggests theft for use rather than money
**International Interest:** Foreign inquiries about Aquabyssos crafting decline

## Social Consequences
- Young crafters unable to learn advanced techniques
- Guild membership declining due to reduced opportunities
- Quality of city infrastructure suffering from poor materials
- Military equipment quality compromised
- Cultural heritage of legendary craftsmanship threatened

## Recovery Efforts
**Reward Offered:** 10,000 gp for anvil's return
**International Appeals:** Diplomatic requests for assistance
 **Magical Tracking:** Ongoing scrying attempts to locate anvil
**Informant Networks:** Underground contacts seeking information
**Alternative Solutions:** Research into replacement magical techniques

 ## Adventure Hooks
1. Party hired to investigate and recover the stolen anvil
