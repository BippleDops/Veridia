The Screaming Battleground is a vast, cursed wasteland where the final battle between the ancient [[Ancient Mer-Folk Empire (D&D_References)]] and the surface kingdoms was fought 500 years ago. The intense magical conflict left the land permanently scarred, with crystalline formations erupting from the earth and the screams of the fallen echoing eternally across the battlefield. Now it serves as a dangerous wasteland where desperate parties venture for ancient treasures and lost magical artifacts. ### Archaeological Expeditions

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Screaming Battleground as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Screaming Battleground. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Alliance - Manipulate succession
