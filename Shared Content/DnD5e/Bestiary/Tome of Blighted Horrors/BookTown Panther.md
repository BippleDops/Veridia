[[45nl2s31.2pd.png|open outside]]

*This black-furred panther would not seem noteworthy were it not for its exceptional size and six legs, one of which has a twisted and mangled paw from some past hunter’s trap. The beast seems to bear a perpetual snarl as one side of its face is badly scarred, pulling its mouth up and its eye into a puckered squint.*

This creature is a legend in BookTown. Allegedly, a panther of great size originally imported from the distant swamps of southern Akados for the private gardens of a dabbler in the arcane arts, it is said that this arcanist worked magic beyond his abilities, causing the panther to mutate, grow additional limbs, and ultimately, develop a malign intelligence of its own. Each tale of the BookTown panther describes tortures visited on the creature at the hands of its demented master, each more horrible than the previous.

The truth of these tales remains in question, but what is not in question is that a black panther of prodigious proportions does stalk the unwary among the roofs and gables of BookTown. Eyewitnesses report that it indeed has an extra set of limbs, though one has been badly injured at some point in the past. Efforts to hunt the beast have failed, as it proves to be incredibly elusive, and it seems to have a great knowledge of where the many nests of wasps, centipedes, and other vermin can be found among the gables. The few times hunters have even gotten close to it, they have run afoul of swarms of such insects while the beast made its escape.

The truth of the matter is that a demented urban druid of BookTown indeed tortured and experimented upon the panther. The druid raised the panther’s IQ to the point of sentience and self-awareness, but his magic wasn’t entirely successful — the newly aware creature was not inclined to friendliness toward him. At first feigning obedience, the panther merely awaited an opportunity when the druid’s guard was down and its cage left unsecured before striking and messily devouring the fool. The panther did not escape unscathed. Traps left as contingencies by the druid severely injured the beast and crippled one of its legs as it disappeared into the night.

Rather than try to flee the city where it knew that it would be hunted, the BookTown panther chose instead to lair among the dangers of the city’s rooftops where few dared to venture. Its great size and strength provided it with some protection from the myriad dangers to be found there, allowing it to turn its newfound sentience toward its survival and revenge against all humanoids as it pursued the path of the hunter. In doing so, it learned to harness the ubiquitous vermin that continually swarmed among the spires and rooftops of the city, eventually even gaining a giant wasp as an animal companion.

The panther has shed the name given to it by its former master as a mark of its past shame and captivity, and instead prefers to remain nameless. It has heard the moniker of BookTown panther given to it, and doesn’t care one way of the other. It simply sees the soft, fleshy humanoids as prey to sate its hunger for revenge. It likewise doesn’t name the giant wasp that always accompanies it, seeing it as nothing more than an expendable resource to be used for assistance and protection, and indeed is already on its seventh giant wasp companion, the prior six all having fallen in the panther’s wake as it abandoned them to effect its own escape. The BookTown panther is a remorseless killer, but it is careful and cunning. It has lived many years atop the tenements of BookTown and has no intention of meeting its end anytime soon. It is patient and cautious in its hunts, willing to stalk a chosen victim for days, maybe even harassing it with swarms of vermin before moving in to make its kill.

The city of Castorhage has offered a 15,000-gp reward if this creature is captured or killed.
