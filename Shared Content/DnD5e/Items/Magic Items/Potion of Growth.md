# Potion of Growth

## Overview
**Type**: Magic Item

**Group**: *Potions*

**Rarity**: *Uncommon*


## Description
When you drink this potion, you gain the “enlarge” effect of the **[[Enlarge_Reduce|enlarge/reduce]]** spell for  `dice: 1d4` (1d4) hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the [[Glass Bottle|bottle]] fails to interrupt this process.
