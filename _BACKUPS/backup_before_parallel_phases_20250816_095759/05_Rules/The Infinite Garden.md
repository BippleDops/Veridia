## Overview

The Infinite Garden defies conventional understanding of space and dimension. Each crystal tree in this submarine forest contains a complete garden within its crystalline fruit, and each garden within contains more trees with more gardens, recursing into infinity. Visitors often spend life[[Times exploring a single branch, only to discover they've never left the entrance.

### The Primary Garden

The "outermost" layer spans roughly three square miles of seafloor, though measurements become meaningless here. Massive crystal trees grow from beds of prismatic [Coral]], their branches heavy with fruit that contains entire worlds.

**Crystal Tree Properties**:
- Height: 30-300 feet (simultaneously)
- Fruit: Each contains a complete garden 1/10th the size
- Roots: Extend into parallel dimensions
- Bark: Shows reflections of all possible versions of viewers

### The Fruit Worlds

Each crystalline fruit is a portal to a smaller but complete version of the garden. Time moves faster in deeper recursions:
- **Level 1**: 1 hour = 1 hour
- **Level 2**: 1 hour = 10 hours
- **Level 3**: 1 hour = 100 hours
- **Level 4**: 1 hour = 1,000 hours
- **Level 5+**: Time becomes non-linear

**Mechanical Effect**: Characters entering fruit worlds must make a **DC 15** WIS save or forget which level of reality they originated from.

### The Probability Flowerbeds

Flowers that bloom in all possible states simultaneouslyâ€”budding, flowering, dying, and not-existing at once. Picking one collapses probability, potentially changing reality.

**Probability Flower Effects** (Roll `dice: 1d12`):
1-2: Flower was never picked (action undone)
3-4: Flower becomes a different object entirely
5-6: Picker gains a memory of picking it before
7-8: Flower multiplies into [[`dice: 2d6` identical flowers
9-10: Flower grants vision of one possible future
11: Flower contains a tiny garden (new recursion)
12: Picker temporarily exists in all probable states

### The Fractal Fountain

At the garden's heart, an impossible fountain flows in all directions simultaneouslyâ€”up, down, inward, and through dimensions. Its water is actually liquid mathematics, and drinking it allows comprehension of the garden's true nature.

**Drinking Effects**:
- **Success** (**DC 20** INT save): Gain ability to navigate recursions, understand infinite mathematics
- **Failure**: Mind fragments across infinite possibilities, gain indefinite madness
- **Critical Failure**: Consciousness scattered across all garden levels

### The Gardener Recursions

The same gardener exists at every level of the garden, each a smaller or larger version, all working in perfect synchronization. They claim to be one entity experiencing infinite perspectives simultaneously.

**The Infinite Gardener** (CR Variable)
- Exists at all CR levels simultaneously (CR 1 through CR 20)
- Can attack from multiple reality levels at once
- Immune to damage unless hit in all recursions simultaneously

### Nested Civilizations

Entire civilizations exist within the fruit worlds, unaware they're inside a garden inside a garden. Some have developed technology to travel between recursion levels, creating complex trade routes through dimensional layers.

**Notable Nested Cultures**:
- **The Mote Empire**: Rules 17 levels deep, trades in compressed space
- **The Ascending Monks**: Attempting to reach the "true" reality
- **The Recursive Raiders**: [Pirates]] who raid across dimensional scales

### Probability Sprites

Beings that exist in quantum superposition, experiencing all possible versions of themselves. They speak in overlapping voices, each stating different truths.

### Size Paradoxes

Characters can encounter themselves from other recursion levels:
- Meet a giant version from an upper level
- Encounter a microscopic version from a deeper level
- Find their own corpse from a failed [[Timeline

### Navigation Challenges

**Getting Lost** (Roll `dice: 1d20`):
- 1-5: Move one recursion deeper without realizing
- 6-10: Exit into the wrong level's version of the garden
- 11-15: Temporarily exist in multiple levels
- 16-19: Successfully navigate
- 20: Discover shortcut between non-adjacent levels

### "[The Lost Expedition]]"

A research team entered the garden years ago but from their perspective, centuries have passed in the deeper recursions. They've built a civilization and forgotten the outside world exists.

### "The Reality Virus"

Something is causing the recursions to collapse into each other. Gardens are merging, creating impossible overlaps where multiple scales exist simultaneously.

### "The Original Seed"

Legend speaks of the seed that grew the first crystal tree. Finding it might grant power over all recursionsâ€”or destroy them all.

### "The Recursive War"

Two civilizations from different recursion levels have declared war, not realizing they're fighting across dimensional scales. [[The Party must broker peace or choose a side.

### The Infinity Market

A market that exists in all recursions simultaneously. Traders can buy from their past selves and sell to their future selves, creating temporal economic loops.

### Recursion Sickness

Spending too long jumping between levels causes existential vertigo:
- **Stage 1**: Confusion about current size/level
- **Stage 2**: Seeing multiple recursions simultaneously
- **Stage 3**: Consciousness splits across levels
- **Stage 4**: Become part of the garden's recursive loop

### The Collapse Points

Areas where recursions intersect incorrectly, creating:
- Gravity that pulls in multiple directions
- Time flowing at different rates in the same space
- Objects that are simultaneously huge and tiny
- Conversations with yourself across scales

### The Infinite Recursion Campaign

The garden serves as the [Central Location]] for reality-bending adventures where players question the nature of existence and exp[[Lore infinite possibilities.

### Connection to [Aethermoor]]

During convergence events, Aethermoor's crystal formations begin showing recursive properties, with tiny kingdoms discovered inside crystal plague victims.

### The Depth Mother Connection

Some theorize the entire garden is just one scale of an even larger recursionâ€”perhaps [[Aquabyssos itself is a fruit in an unimaginably vast garden.

### Memorable Encounters

- Fight the same enemy at multiple scales simultaneously
- Negotiate with a civilization inside the party's water bottle
- Race against time as it moves differently per level
- Discover the party's actions in one level affect all others

*"I've spent three lifetimes [map]]ping the garden, only to discover I've never left the shadow of the first tree. The infinite is not just vastâ€”it's intimate, existing in every scale simultaneously."*
