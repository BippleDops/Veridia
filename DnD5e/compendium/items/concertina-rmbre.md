# Concertina
*Wondrous Item, rare*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

A concertina is a less charming kind of accordion.

In addition to knocking out a killer polka, a creature playing the concertina can use an action to cause an area of mist or water up to 30 feet in diameter and 6 inches deep to freeze solid.

Once used, this feature of the concertina can't be used again until the next dawn.

Any creatures touching the floor must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by the ice. As an action, a [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained) creature can attempt to free itself or another creature within its reach from the ice, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) check. A character freed from the ice is no longer [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained) by it. The ice melts in an hour.
