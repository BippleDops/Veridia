# Cone of Cold
A blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes `dice: 8d8|avg` (8d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
