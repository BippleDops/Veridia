_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_ The region containing an adult or ancient black dragon's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects: - **Acrid Haze.** Odorous and stifling fog covers the area within 1 mile of the lair, rendering that area [[lightly-obscured-xphb (variant-rules). Travel for creatures other than the dragon and its allies takes twice the usual time in that area. - **Foul Water.** Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. A creature that drinks such water must succeed on a **DC 15** Constitution saving throw or have the [conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition for 1 hour. If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. ## Player-Facing Summary Black dragon xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of black dragon xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around black dragon xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - An heirloom has gone missing and chaos spreads
