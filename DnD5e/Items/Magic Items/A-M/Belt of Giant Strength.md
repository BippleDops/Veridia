## Description

While wearing this belt, your [[Strength|Strength]] score changes to a score granted by the belt. If your [[Strength|Strength]] is already equal to or greater than the beltâ€™s score, the item has no effect on you.

Six varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with and having rarity according to the six kinds of true [[14 - Monsters|giants]]. The *belt of [[Giant, Stone|stone giant]] strength* and the *belt of [[Giant, Frost|frost giant]] strength* look different, but they have the same effect.
