# The Phosphor Markets - The Glowing Bazaar

## Overview
The Phosphor Markets are a massive floating collection of bioluminescent platforms, ships, and structures that drift through the Gloom Gardens, never staying in one location for more than a week. This mobile marketplace is the economic heart of [[01_Campaigns/Aquabyssos/Lore/Aquabyssos World Overview|Aquabyssos]], where all factions trade despite political tensions. The market's neutrality is enforced by the [[01_Campaigns/Aquabyssos/Factions/Merchant's Covenant|Merchant's Covenant]], a powerful trading guild that predates the drowning.

## Market Sections

### The Central Exchange
Massive platform made from a hollowed-out whale corpse, preserved and reinforced with magic. [[Market Master Cornelius Driftwood]] oversees all major trades from his office in what was once the creature's heart.

### The Glow Gardens
Living market stalls made from cultivated bioluminescent coral and kelp. [[Merchant Delilah Currentrunner]] coordinates vendors selling biological goods from [[01_Campaigns/Aquabyssos/Locations/Lumengarde]].

### The Deep Bazaar
Lower platforms dealing in goods from the dangerous depths. [[Trader Grimm Voidheart]] specializes in items from [[01_Campaigns/Aquabyssos/Locations/The Cerulean Trench]] and [[The Hadal Depths]].

### The Memory Lane
Section dedicated to pre-drowning artifacts and memories. [[Antiquarian Eliza Tidecaller]] authenticates items while [[Memory Merchant Zephyr Mindweaver]] trades in extracted memories.

### The Black Current
Unofficial section where illegal goods change hands. [[Shadow Merchant Riptide]] operates here, selling everything from forbidden adaptations to [[Deepmind Conspiracy]] artifacts.

### The Neutral Docks
Where trading vessels from all factions moor. [[Dockmaster Bruno Steadyanchor]] maintains order and assigns berths based on elaborate bribes.

## Notable Establishments

### The Floating Fortune Casino
Gambling house run by [[Lucky Finn Dicetide]], where fortunes are won and lost on games of chance and skill. Rumored to be rigged with divination magic.

### The Depth's End Tavern
Neutral meeting ground managed by [[Barkeep Salty Sarah]], serves drinks that work in both air and water. Information is the real commodity here.

### The Current Exchange Bank
Financial institution managing the market's complex economy. [[Banker Titus Goldcurrent]] handles currency exchange between different faction monies.

### The Adaptation Parlor
[[Doctor Coral Shapeshift]] offers temporary and permanent biological modifications, from gills to pressure resistance. Not all procedures are legal or safe.
