--- # The Deep Uprising *"From the crushing depths came voices that would not be silenced."* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

The Deep Uprising was a revolutionary movement led by the deepest-dwelling inhabitants of Aquabyssos who felt marginalized by the surface-oriented politics of the upper city. These deep dwellers, adapted to extreme pressure and darkness, demanded greater representation and challenged the depth-based social hierarchy that had dominated underwater society. ### Duration

Active uprising lasted two years, with political ramifications continuing to present day. ## Adventure Hooks

1. **Uprising Veterans**: Characters encounter former revolutionaries
2. **Unfinished Business**: Remaining uprising goals create new conflicts
3. Meanwhile, **Counter-Revolution**: Surface loyalists attempt to reverse reforms ## Campaign Use

Provides political complexity and opportunities for characters to engage with social justice themes in underwater society. ## Player-Facing Summary The Deep Uprising is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Deep Uprising as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around The Deep Uprising. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A noble needs help delivering before the new moon
