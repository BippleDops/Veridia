*Spellcasting focus* - **Cost**: 5 gp
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs. For a Reliquary to be an effective Holy Symbol, it must be held. *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 226. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Reliquary xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of reliquary xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around reliquary xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Shadow Alliance - Control trade routes ## Plot Hooks - A document has gone missing and evil awakens
