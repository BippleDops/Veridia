# The Order of the Shattered Crown

*"From broken royalty, we forge new purpose in service."*

## Overview
The Order of the Shattered Crown is a religious organization composed primarily of former nobility who have renounced their titles and wealth to serve the common people. Founded after a devastating civil war, they seek redemption through charitable works and protection of the defenseless.
