# Possess (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: 500 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a bowl or stick of in-cense and a figurine of the being to be pos-sessed)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour


## Effects
You release your soul from your body and possess another humanoid or beast. That creature must make a Charisma saving throw to resist. If it fails, you take over its body.

The target becomes incapacitated and unconscious. While in control of this body, you have resistance to all forms of damage except for psychic—injuries your body takes will appear, in reduced form, on your actual body. You may use the target body’s Strength, Dexterity and Constitution but you retain your own Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. You do not have access to the target’s knowledge, memories, class features, or proficiencies.

If the body you are in drops to 0 hit points, the possession ends and you must make a Charisma saving throw. You take 6d6 psychic damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one. You may choose to end the possession at any time.

A target is immune to your attempts to possess it for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or the possession ends.
