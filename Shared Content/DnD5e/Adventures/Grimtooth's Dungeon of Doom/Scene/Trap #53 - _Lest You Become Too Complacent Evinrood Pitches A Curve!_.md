# Trap #53 - "Lest You Become Too Complacent Evinrood Pitches A Curve!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> To progress further the party will have to return to the Flour/Explosion room. The tomb robbers will have to be more thorough in their search. Keep in mind the same kind of spell that have been revealing the doors hidden behind the stucco can also serve to point the way to a trap door hidden beneath the flour. This will mean more digging, and if the party has not learned its lesson more chances to be blown up!
> 
> Once the tomb robbers have levered the trap door open they will find it a short 10 foot hop to the floor of a hall leading 20 feet to a blank stucco wall. This hall is 20 feet long, 10 feet wide and 10 feet tall. Along the walls are patterns, twisted geometric forms, worked in gold leaf. These patterns reveal no images, just random-seeming forms, one after another culminating in a final whirlpool of gold on the far wall.
> 
> The value of the gold leaf is nominal. All together there would not be much over 50 g.p. It is hammered micro-thin and cemented in place on the stucco. (The party will ask. Given a glint of gold their rapacious little hearts will want to scrape it off the very walls!)
> 
> The door can be found under the stucco at the end of the hall. As usual this is a three finger hole door. What is unusual is what happens when the holes are probed. By now the delvers will have sunk into a routine when confronted by these type of doors. It will be "we open the door in the usual manner." Sticks will be poked, annored fingers inserted, or an appropriate low level spell cast. If they do this now the fun will really begin.
> 
> If the tomb robbers push one button at a time, the results will be as follows. Out of the ceiling in the first 10 by 10 foot section will emerge a large hydraulically driven steel framework. This will be driven down to the floor with considerable force. It is in effect like a giant egg slicer, razor sharp, driven by the force of tons of water pressure! Delvers who are in this section have a 50% chance (L5) to leap forward and avoid being julienned. Otherwise only enchanted annor, proof against immense damage, or the redoubtable "indestructible" item can save them. The mesh and the driving mechanism, four giant pistons concealed in the comers of the ceiling, will remain extended. The grid is only about a foot thick. Any delvers caught in it should slump over rather easily, or rather long slender parts of them!
> 
> The second button will cause the 10 foot by 10 foot floor section right before the door to fall out from under the feet of the delvers operating the door opening mechanism. Again there will be a 50% chance (L5) to leap back. If the delvers fail to do so they will plummet into what is to all intents and purposes a bottomless pit. Screams should echo up out of it, magnified by the walls for some time, fading slowly as the distance increases!
> 
> The last finger hole pushed will cause another hydraulically driven piston to slam the door downward from its top on the place where the floor was. This will neatly cover the hole, and also serve to whack flyswauerlike any flying character who happens to be pressing the last button. If the floor has fallen away and the delver is flying, there is a 50% chance it can dive down into the hole and escape, or it may try to fly back into the hall, but there is only a 30% chance (L7) of that. Of course if the floor has not fallen away then, squoosh!
> 
> The most dramatic effect can be achieved if a wizard magics the door open or if the party pushes all three at once! All the traps activate simultaneously, and chances of survival in this case are very, very dim! 
> 
> This door and hall trap is a masterpiece, using the delvers complacency about a deadly device against them, and having the traps come in waves, if they are not maximally careless. Four skulls, for sure. Watch the delvers scramble.
