--- # Warden Marcus Stonehand *"Justice without mercy is tyranny, mercy without justice is chaos. In these depths, I maintain the balance that keeps civilization from drowning in its own darkness."* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview Warden Marcus Stonehand oversees Aquabyssos's primary detention facility, known as the Pressure Depths, where the city's most dangerous criminals are held in specially designed underwater cells. A former military officer who transitioned to corrections work after a career-ending injury, Marcus has spent fifteen years developing innovative approaches to underwater incarceration and prisoner rehabilitation. Stonehand earned his nickname both for his unyielding adherence to protocol and for his prosthetic left hand, replaced with an enchanted stone construct after losing it in a prison riot early in his tenure. His facility has become a model for other underwater realms, combining security with humane treatment and successful rehabilitation programs. As political tensions rise in Aquabyssos, Marcus faces increasing pressure from various factions wanting access to prisoners or demanding special treatment for their captured members. ## Appearance Marcus is a weathered human in his late forties, with graying hair kept in a military-style cut and alert brown eyes that constantly assess situations for potential security threats. His left hand is a masterwork of stone and metal craftsmanship, articulated with magical mechanisms that make it as functional as flesh. He wears a modified warden's uniform designed for underwater environments, with reinforced materials and pressure-resistant components. His bearing reflects his military background - straight posture, precise movements, and an authoritative presence that commands respect from both staff and prisoners. ## Statistics

**Multiattack.** Marcus makes two attacks with his truncheon or one truncheon attack and uses Stone Grip. **Enchanted Truncheon +1.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`dice: 1d6` + 4) bludgeoning damage. Target must make **DC 15** Constitution save or be stunned until the end of their next turn. **Stone Grip.** Marcus attempts to grapple with his stone hand (advantage on the roll). Grappled creatures take `dice: 1d6` + 3 crushing damage at the start of each turn. **Lockdown Command (1/day).** Marcus can activate prison security systems in a 100-foot radius, sealing doors and activating restraint fields for 10 minutes. **Call Guards (1/day).** Marcus summons `dice: 2d4` prison guards who arrive in `dice: 1d4` rounds. ## Background Marcus served as a military police officer for twelve years before transferring to civilian corrections work. His military experience with discipline and order made him a natural fit for warden duties, while his personal code of honor ensured fair treatment for all prisoners. The loss of his left hand during his second year as warden - sacrificed to save a guard during a prison riot - became a defining moment. His decision to continue his duties with a prosthetic demonstrated his dedication and earned the loyalty of his staff. Under his leadership, the Pressure Depths has achieved the lowest recidivism rate of any correctional facility in the underwater realms, thanks to Marcus's innovative rehabilitation programs. ## Current Activities Marcus is dealing with increased pressure from various factions wanting special treatment for their imprisoned members or access to prisoners for interrogation. He's maintaining his strict neutrality while preparing for the possibility that political conflicts might affect prison security. He's also investigating reports of attempts to communicate with high-security prisoners and evidence that some inmates may have connections to the broader conspiracy affecting the city. ## Quest Hooks

1. Marcus approaches the party for help investigating external attempts to influence or extract information from prisoners.
2. A prisoner with crucial information is targeted for assassination, and Marcus needs protection for them.
3. The party needs to interview a dangerous prisoner, requiring negotiation with Marcus about security protocols. ## DM Notes
