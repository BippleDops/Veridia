# Poison Mister
## Overview
*Mechanical trap*
A nozzle connected to a vial of poison gas is hidden within a chest's lock or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the object without the proper key causes the nozzle to spring out, spraying poison.

When the trap is triggered the nozzle creates a 15-foot cone of gas originating from the lock. Creatures within the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Creatures who fail take 22 (4d10) poison damage and are poisoned for 1 hour. Creatures who succeed take half damage and are not poisoned.

A DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap's presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the nozzle and vial. A DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disarms the trap, removing the nozzle and gas vial from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.

A DM can choose to have a different kind of inhaled poison (Dungeon Master's Guide page 257â€“258) within the lock. The effects and save DC for the poison change as appropriate.
