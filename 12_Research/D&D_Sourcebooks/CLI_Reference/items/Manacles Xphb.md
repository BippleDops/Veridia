# Manacles
*Adventuring gear*  


- **Cost**: 2 gp
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

As a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action, you can use Manacles to bind an unwilling Small or Medium creature within 5 feet of yourself that has the [[conditions#Grappled|Grappled]], [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]], or [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition if you succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity ([[skills#Sleight%20of%20Hand|Sleight of Hand]]) check. While bound, a creature has [[disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on attack rolls, and the creature is [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] if the Manacles are attached to a chain or hook that is fixed in place. Escaping the Manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity ([[skills#Sleight%20of%20Hand|Sleight of Hand]]) check as an action. Bursting them requires a successful DC 25 Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check as an action.

Each set of Manacles comes with a key. Without the key, a creature can use [[thieves-tools-xphb|Thieves' Tools]] to pick the Manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([[skills#Sleight%20of%20Hand|Sleight of Hand]]) check.
