--- # Disarming Attack

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 95* When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can expend one Superiority Die to attempt to disarm the target. Add the Superiority Die roll to the attack's damage roll. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or drop one object of your choice that it's holding, with the object landing in its space. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Disarming attack xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
