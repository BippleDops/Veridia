# Lightning Arrow
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

As your attack hits or misses the target, the weapon or ammunition you're using transforms into a lightning bolt. Instead of taking any damage or other effects from the attack, the target takes `4d8` Lightning damage on a hit or half as much damage on a miss. Each creature within 10 feet of the target then makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `2d8` Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

The weapon or ammunition then returns to its normal form.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage for both effects of the spell increases by `d8` for each spell slot level above 3.
