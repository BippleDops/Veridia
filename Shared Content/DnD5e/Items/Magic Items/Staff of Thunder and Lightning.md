## Description
This [[Staff|staff]] can be wielded as a magic [[Quarterstaff|quarterstaff]] that grants a +2 bonus to [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] and damage rolls made with it. It also has the following additional properties. When one of these properties is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

***Lightning.*** When you hit with a melee [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] using the [[Staff|staff]], you can cause the target to take an extra `dice: 2d6` (2d6) [[17 - Damage and Healing|lightning]] damage.

***Thunder.*** When you hit with a melee [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] using the [[Staff|staff]], you can cause the staff to emit a crack of [[17 - Damage and Healing|thunder]], audible out to 300 feet. The target you hit must succeed on a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 17 [[Constitution|Constitution]] saving throw or become [[Stunned|stunned]] until the end of your next turn.

***Lightning Strike.*** You can use an action to cause a [[Crossbow Bolts (20)|bolt]] of [[17 - Damage and Healing|lightning]] to leap from the [[Staff|staff]]’s tip in a [[2 - Casting a Spell|line]] that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. Each creature in that line must make a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 17 [[Dexterity|Dexterity]] saving throw, taking `dice: 9d6` (9d6) [[17 - Damage and Healing|lightning]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Thunderclap.*** You can use an action to cause the [[Staff|staff]] to issue a deafening thunderclap, audible out to 600 feet. Each creature within 60 feet of you (not including you) must make a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 17 [[Constitution|Constitution]] saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice: 2d6` (2d6) [[17 - Damage and Healing|thunder]] damage and becomes [[Deafened|deafened]] for 1minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn’t deafened.

***Thunder and Lightning.*** You can use an action to use the [[17 - Damage and Healing|Lightning]] Strike and Thunderclap properties at the same time. Doing so doesn’t expend the daily use of those properties, only the use of this one.

**Versatile**. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
