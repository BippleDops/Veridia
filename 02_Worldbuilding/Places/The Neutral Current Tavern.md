# The Neutral Current Tavern
*Where All Currents Meet and Stories Flow*

> *"In the deep waters, there are few comforts greater than a warm meal, good drink, and the company of fellow travelers. Here, diplomats and merchants, spies and scholars all share the same tables, and somehow, peace prevails."*
> â€” [[Keeper Finn Goodtide]], Proprietor of The Neutral Current Tavern

Operating under the same neutrality laws that govern the entire district, the tavern has become legendary for its ability to host bitter enemies at neighboring tables without incident.
