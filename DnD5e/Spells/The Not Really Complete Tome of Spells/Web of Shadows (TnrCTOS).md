# Web of Shadows (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of spider web)

**Duration**: 12 hours


## Effects
You fill an area 40 cubic feet with shadow-grey, intangible strands of force that resembles a giant spider web. The webbing is almost invisible. It requires a DC 18 Investigation check to locate them. Once created, these webs cannot be harmed by any nonmagical attacks.

Any creature who enters the web has its movement slowed to 10 feet. Each round a creature ends its turn in the webbing, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 3d10 cold damage on a failed saving throw and has its Strength reduced by 1; the creature takes half as much damage on a successful check and does not lose Strength. Lost Strength returns after the creature takes a long rest.
