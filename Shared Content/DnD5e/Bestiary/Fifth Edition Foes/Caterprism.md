## Actions
**Multiattack:** A caterprism attacks four times with claws, or once with mandibles, or spews its crystal saliva.

**Claw:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (`dice: 1d8+5`) slashing damage.

**Mandibles:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (`dice: 2d8+5` piercing damage). This attack has tactical advantage against targets in armor. If the bite scores a critical hit, the target must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be reduced to 0 hit points instantly. Crystal Saliva (Recharge 6): automatic hit, range 20 ft. cone, creatures in range. Hit: 10 (`dice: 3d6`) piercing damage, or half damage with a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, and the affected area becomes difficult terrain for all creatures except caterprisms.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Elemental plane of earth

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, or nest (2–5)

## Description
Caterprisms come from the Elemental Plane of Earth. They resemble gigantic caterpillars made of crystal, with hexagonal body segments and twelve sharply-angled legs. Each body segment is about two feet long and contains a single pair of legs. The head of a caterprism contains its large, faceted eyes and huge, crystalline mandibles that can snip the head off an armored warrior as easily as scissors snip the head from a paper doll.

Besides its crystalline claws and mandibles of unearthly sharpness, a caterprism can also spew a silklike substance in a 20-foot cone. This substance instantly solidifies into rock-hard, needle-sharp spears of crystal.

Although caterprisms prefer to consume the rich minerals of their home plane, they sometimes wander through natural portals into the Material Plane. There they create long, winding tunnels as they eat their way through solid rock. Dwarves have been known to bring caterprisms under some degree of control and use them to help carve out mines and new dwelling places. A caterprism can eat through 1 foot of solid stone per minute, leaving behind a tunnel 5 feet in diameter.

If it feels threatened, a caterprism’s first action is to spew its silklike saliva at opponents. It then closes in to bite or rears up and stabs at opponents with the first four of its razor sharp legs.
