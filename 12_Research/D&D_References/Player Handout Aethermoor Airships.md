# Aethermoor Airships â€” Visual & Vibe Guide

- Wind-Sung Clipper: Silk sails inscribed with songs; ripples shimmer with notes.
- Void-Touched Corsair: Black gravity orbs; starlight swallowed at the prow.
- Nimbus Garden: Cloud-lilies and rain-vines; crew walk on mist bridges.
- Star-Anchored Platform: Bronze pylons with star sigils; steady as the night.
- Thunder Sloop: Crackling lances, storm-etched hull, ozone scent.
- Aurora Ark: Prism shields spill color; ship vanishes into dawn.

Ship choice shapes play: speed, stealth, sanity resilience, and upgrade slots differ. See [[Vehicles - Vehicle Customization Progression]].
