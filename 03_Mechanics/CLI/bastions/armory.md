# Armory
*Level 5 Bastion facility*  

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Space**: Roomy (16 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 1
- **Order**: trade

An Armory contains mannequins for displaying armor, hooks for holding Shields, racks for storing weapons, and chests for holding ammunition.

## Trade: Stock Armory

When you issue the "Trade" order to this facility, you commission the facility's hireling to stock the Armory with armor, [Shields](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/shield-xphb.md), weapons, and ammunition. This equipment costs you 100 GP plus an extra 100 GP for each Bastion Defender in your Bastion. If your Bastion has a "Smithy", the total cost is halved.

While your Armory is stocked, your Bastion Defenders are harder to kill. When any event causes you to roll dice to determine if your Bastion loses one or more of its defenders (see ""Bastion Events"" at the end of this chapter), roll `d8` in place of each `d6` you would normally roll. When the event is over, the equipment in your Armory is expended regardless of how many Bastion Defenders you have or how many you lost, leaving your Armory depleted until you issue another Trade order to the facility and pay the cost to restock it.

## Player-Facing Summary

Armory is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of armory as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around armory.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties armory to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at armory to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to armory active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
