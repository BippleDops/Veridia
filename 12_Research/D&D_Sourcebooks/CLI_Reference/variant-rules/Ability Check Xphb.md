# Ability Check
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 360. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

An ability check is a [[d20-test-xphb|D20 Test]] that represents using one of the six abilities—or a specific skill associated with an ability—to overcome a challenge.

## Player-Facing Summary

Ability check xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of ability check xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around ability check xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties ability check xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at ability check xphb to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to ability check xphb active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
