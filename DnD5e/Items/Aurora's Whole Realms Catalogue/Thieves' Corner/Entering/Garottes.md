## Description
Only the worst and most vile of thieves would garotte a guard when a more cunning and less brutal method commends itself. Even so, I receive enough orders for these that I feel I must stock them. All my garottes are constructed of strong wire and hardwood handles—and all are damnably effective. (3 sp)
