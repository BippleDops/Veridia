# Green Dragon

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing an adult or ancient green dragon's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Beast Spies.** Tiny Beasts magically gain the ability to understand Draconic and can communicate telepathically with the dragon while within 1 mile of the lair.  
- **Poisonous Thicket.** Ordinary plants growing within 1 mile of the lair poison the air around them. Whenever a creature other than the dragon or its allies finishes a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]] in that area, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition for 1 hour.  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
