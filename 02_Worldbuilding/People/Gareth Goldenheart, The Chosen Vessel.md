# Gareth Goldenheart, The Chosen Vessel
*Bearer of the Golden Shard, The Innocent Divine*

## Overview
Eight-year-old Gareth was born with the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards|Golden Shard]] already within his heart—a phenomenon that has never occurred in recorded history. Unlike [[Aria Lumengarde]], who was artificially implanted with divine essence, Gareth represents natural divine incarnation. He appears as a normal child but occasionally displays impossible abilities that terrify and inspire those around him. Hidden in a royal orphanage, his true nature is known only to a select few.

## Description
- **Appearance**: Ordinary boy with bright golden eyes that sometimes glow with inner light
- **Personality**: Innocent, curious, surprisingly wise for his age
- **The Golden Mark**: When using divine abilities, golden veins of light appear beneath his skin
- **Presence**: Animals are drawn to him, plants bloom in his footsteps when he's happy
- **Voice**: Sometimes speaks with knowledge far beyond his years

## Background
### The Miraculous Birth
- Born to a common tavern maid in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]]
- Mother died in childbirth, but child survived impossible complications
- Midwife noticed golden glow in the baby's chest
- Father unknown, possibly divine intervention
- Brought to royal orphanage after displaying miraculous abilities

### Early Manifestations
- At age 3: Healed a dying bird by touching it
- At age 5: Spoke prophecy about "seven becoming one" in ancient language
- At age 6: Made bread multiply to feed all orphanage children
- At age 7: Calmed a violent storm by asking it to "please be quiet"
- Recently: Beginning to have dreams of other Shard locations

### Growing Complications

- Multiple factions have "reasonable" claims on his allegiance
- His innocence is both his protection and vulnerability

### The Divine Questions

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Gareth fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Golden Shard Integration.** Unlike other bearers, Gareth was born with the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards|Golden Shard]] already part of his heart. It cannot be removed without killing him, and its power grows as he matures.

**Divine Innocence.** Gareth's pure heart and innocent nature provide supernatural protection. All damage dealt to him is reduced by half, and anyone who intentionally harms him must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or be wracked with overwhelming guilt (stunned for 1 round).

**Truth Sight.** Gareth automatically knows when someone is lying to him. He can also see the true nature of creatures (celestial, fiend, undead, etc.) regardless of disguises or illusions.

**Shard Resonance.** Gareth can sense the location, emotional state, and general well-being of all other Shard bearers across any distance or plane. This connection grows stronger as he ages.

**Innocent Authority.** When Gareth speaks with conviction about right and wrong, all creatures within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 23 Charisma saving throw or be compelled to act according to his moral guidance for 24 hours.

**Divine Growth.** As Gareth ages and learns, his Challenge Rating increases. At age 12: CR 15, at age 16: CR 18, at adulthood: CR 20+. His abilities also mature and become more controlled.

**Miracle Worker (Recharge on Long Rest).** Once per day, Gareth can perform a miracle that defies normal magical limitations. This might include:
- Raising the dead without material components or time limits
- Permanently curing any disease or curse
- Creating food for thousands from a single loaf
- Calming any storm or natural disaster
- Purifying any corruption or taint

**Spellcasting.** Gareth is a 15th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). He knows the following spells and casts them without material components:

- **Cantrips (at will):** light, mending, prestidigitation, sacred flame, thaumaturgy
- **1st level (4 slots):** bless, cure wounds, detect evil and good, sanctuary
- **2nd level (3 slots):** aid, calm emotions, lesser restoration, zone of truth
- **3rd level (3 slots):** beacon of hope, counterspell, daylight, remove curse
- **4th level (3 slots):** freedom of movement, guardian of faith, death ward
- **5th level (2 slots):** greater restoration, mass cure wounds, raise dead
- **6th level (1 slot):** heal, heroes' feast, word of recall
- **7th level (1 slot):** plane shift, regenerate, resurrection
- **8th level (1 slot):** antimagic field, holy aura

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Gareth can cast a spell and use one other action, or make two Touch of Grace attacks.

**Touch of Grace.** *Melee Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* If the target is willing, they regain 22 (4d6 + 8) hit points and are cured of one condition. If unwilling, they must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw or take 22 (4d6 + 8) radiant damage and be stunned until the end of their next turn as divine power overwhelms them.

**Golden Light (3/Day).** Gareth's divine nature manifests as brilliant golden light in a 60-foot radius. All creatures in the area must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw. Undead, fiends, and corrupted creatures take 36 (8d8) radiant damage on a failure (half on success) and are blinded for 1 minute. All other creatures regain 18 (4d8) hit points and gain advantage on their next ability check or saving throw.

**Divine Word of Command (1/Day).** Gareth speaks a single word in Celestial that resonates with divine authority. Choose one effect:
- **"PEACE"**: All hostile actions within 300 feet stop for 1 minute
- **"HEAL"**: All creatures within 120 feet are fully restored to maximum hit points
- **"TRUTH"**: All deceptions within 120 feet are revealed, illusions dispelled
- **"BEGONE"**: All undead, fiends, or corrupted creatures within 60 feet are banished
- **"SLEEP"**: All creatures within 60 feet fall into peaceful sleep for 8 hours

**Food Miracle (1/Day).** Gareth can create a feast that feeds up to 1,000 people from any small amount of food. The food provides all nourishment needed and cures minor ailments.

**Weather Blessing (1/Day).** Gareth can ask the weather to "please be nice." This functions as the *control weather* spell but affects a 50-mile radius and the weather responds gently to his innocent requests.

**Resurrection Miracle (1/Week).** Gareth can bring someone back to life with a touch, regardless of how long they've been dead or the condition of their body. This works even on creatures whose souls have been destroyed, as the Golden Shard can recreate souls from divine essence.

### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)
Gareth can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.

**Move.** Gareth moves up to his speed, potentially manifesting golden wings to fly.

**Innocent Question.** Gareth asks a simple question that reveals important truth. One creature within 60 feet must answer honestly.

**Divine Comfort.** Gareth touches a creature within 5 feet. They regain 15 hit points and are cured of fear, charm, or despair.

**Golden Miracle (Costs 2 Actions).** Gareth casts a spell of 4th level or lower without expending a spell slot.

**Shard Communion (Costs 3 Actions).** Gareth briefly contacts another Shard bearer, sharing healing, warnings, or comfort across any distance.

### Lair Actions
When at the Royal Orphanage or another place he considers "home," Gareth can take lair actions on initiative count 20:

**Sanctuary Blessing.** The location becomes a sanctuary as the *hallow* spell for 24 hours, preventing any violence within its bounds.

**Golden Warmth.** Divine warmth fills the area. All creatures regain 10 hit points and feel completely safe and loved.

**Children's Laughter.** The sound of innocent joy fills the air. All creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be unable to take hostile actions for 1 round as they remember their own childhood innocence.

## Prophecies & Divine Wisdom

### The Golden Prophecies
Despite his youth, Gareth sometimes speaks with ancient wisdom:

#### The Unity Vision
*"When all the lights come together, they remember they were never really apart. The sad parts and the happy parts, the growing parts and the breaking parts - they're all pieces of the same big story. Someone just forgot how the story was supposed to end."*

#### The Choice of Hearts
*"Everyone keeps asking if I'll be good or bad when I grow up. But that's not the right question. The right question is: will I remember that everyone else is trying to be good too, even when they make mistakes?"*

#### The Healing Truth
*"The hurt parts want to hurt other people, but that just makes more hurt parts. The happy parts want to make other people happy, and that makes more happy parts. When all the hurt parts remember how to be happy parts again, that's when everything gets fixed."*

#### The Divine Childhood
*"Gods are supposed to love everyone like children. But maybe they forgot how to be children themselves. Maybe that's why everything got so complicated."*

### Current Visions & Dreams
- Regular dreams of playing with [[Aria Lumengarde]] in a garden of golden light
- Visions of all seven Shard bearers standing in a circle, holding hands like friends
- Dreams of [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Aetheron]] as a sad, lonely person who just wants his friends back
- Nightmares about grown-ups fighting over something that should bring everyone together
- Happy dreams about teaching other people how to use "helping magic" instead of "hurting magic"

### Questions That Shape Destiny
Gareth's innocent questions often reveal profound truths:
- "Why do the grown-ups think power makes you mean? Doesn't power mean you can help more people?"
- "If everyone wants to be happy, why do they keep doing things that make them sad?"
- "When someone hurts you, why is it better to hurt them back than to help them not hurt anymore?"
- "Why do people think gods are scary? Shouldn't gods be the nicest people of all?"
