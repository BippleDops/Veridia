# Quest: The Drowned Prophecy

## Overview
Ancient prophecies are manifesting as physical objects in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Shadowmere]]'s Lake Gloom—crystallized predictions of a coming flood that will transform Aethermoor into a second Aquabyssos. Someone is collecting these prophecy shards, and their intent could either prevent or ensure this catastrophic future.

## Quest Hook
[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Sister Morwyn Veilkeeper]] contacts the party through disturbing dreams, showing visions of Crystalhaven underwater, its citizens transformed into aquatic horrors. She reveals that prophecy shards are being stolen from Lake Gloom, and without them, she cannot determine which future is becoming real.

## Act 1: Shadows and Prophecies

### The Grey Citadel Meeting
- Sister Morwyn explains the prophecy shards' nature
- Each shard shows a different potential future
- Seven shards have been stolen in the past month
- Payment offered: Shadow-touched items or prophecies about party members' futures

### Initial Investigation
**Lake Gloom Disturbance:**
- Witness sites where shards were extracted
- Find Aquabyssos coral growing in shadow water (impossible naturally)
- Discover deep-dweller tracks leading to underwater passages
- Local shadowkin report seeing "fish people" that shouldn't exist here

**Clues Found:**
- Tidal Court diplomatic seal (leads to [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Nerida Deepcurrent]])
- Crystal Warden patrol schedule (inside information)
- Payment ledger in Whisper Syndicate cipher (involves [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]])

## Act 2: The Conspiracy Web

### The Embassy Investigation
**Infiltrating the Cerulean Depths:**
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Nerida Deepcurrent]]'s embassy shows signs of recent construction
- Hidden basement contains portal pool to [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Sunken Markets]]
- Diplomatic papers discussing "accelerated integration timeline"
- Servants are deep-touched, showing early signs of aquatic transformation

**Confronting the Ambassador:**
- Can be diplomatic or aggressive approach
- Nerida admits knowledge but claims she's trying to prevent the prophecy
- Reveals that someone in Crystalhaven government is the true collector
- Offers alliance if party investigates her rivals

### The Sunken Markets Trail
**Following the Smuggling Route:**
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]] has been moving prophecy shards through the markets
- Claims he's just the middleman, doesn't know final buyer
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Marcus Shardbreaker Grimm]] has been hired to protect shipments
- Marcus reveals buyer uses Crystal Warden codes

**The Depth Speaker's Warning:**
- Ancient entity in the Sunken Markets recognizes the danger
- Reveals that collecting all prophecy shards can either:
  - Summon Thal'mexis, the Sunken Sovereign
  - Create a barrier preventing the Great Drowning
- The intent of the user determines the outcome

## Act 3: The Revelation

### The True Conspirator
> [!warning] DM Secret
> [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Prince Caspian Duskwater]] is collecting the shards, believing he can use them to overthrow his mother and prevent both the crystal corruption and the drowning. He's being manipulated by Thal'mexis through dreams.

**Evidence Points:**
- Crystal Warden resources diverted to "special projects"
- Prince's recent interest in ancient histories
- Secret meetings with various faction representatives
- His quarters contain early transformation symptoms

### The Prophecy Chamber
**Location:** Hidden vault beneath the Crystal Throne
- Prince has constructed a ritual chamber
- Five prophecy shards already in place (two more arriving soon)
- Ancient Aquabyssos architecture (pre-dates Crystalhaven)
- Tidal marks showing water has been here recently

**The Confrontation:**
- Prince genuinely believes he's saving the kingdom
- Shows visions of his mother's corruption worsening
- Argues that controlled flooding is better than crystal plague
- Can be reasoned with (DC 18 Persuasion) or fought

## Possible Outcomes

### If Prince Succeeds
- Begins transformation into Tidal Sovereign's avatar
- Flooding begins in Port Meridian within days
- Aquabyssos gains foothold on surface
- Crystal corruption slows but doesn't stop

### If Party Stops Prince
- Prophecy shards can be:
  - Returned to Lake Gloom (maintains status quo)
  - Destroyed (removes prophecy but not threat)
  - Used differently (party's choice, major consequences)
- Prince's fate affects succession crisis
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Nerida Deepcurrent]]'s reaction depends on party's approach

### If Party Allies with Prince
- Become agents of controlled transformation
- Must manage flooding to minimize casualties
- Gain Aquabyssos allies but surface enemies
- Moral complexity of sacrificing some to save many

## Rewards

### Standard Rewards
- 2,500 gp from Sister Morwyn's order
- Shadow-touched magical items:
  - Cloak of Shadows (advantage on stealth in dim light)
  - Prophecy Lens (1/day cast Augury)
  - Ring of Water Walking

### Faction Rewards
- **Order of Shattered Crown:** Access to shadow magic training
- **Aquabyssos:** Deep-dweller transformation ritual (controlled)
- **Crystal Throne:** Noble titles and land grants
- **Whisper Syndicate:** Valuable blackmail information

### Information Rewards
- Location of one of the Seven Shards
- Truth about [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]'s corruption source
- Map to pre-Shattering ruins beneath Crystalhaven
- Prophecy about each party member's future

## Complications & Side Quests

### The Refugee Crisis
- Lake Gloom's disturbance displaces shadowkin
- Must find new homes or calm the waters
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Archdruid Thornweaver]] offers forest sanctuary

### The Assassin's Mark
- Someone wants the investigation stopped
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Marcus Shardbreaker Grimm]] hired to kill party
- Can be turned into ally with right approach

### The Diplomatic Incident
- Investigation exposes embassy secrets
- International tensions threaten war
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Castellan Ironledger III]] offers to mediate (for a price)

## NPC Motivations

### Sister Morwyn Veilkeeper
- Wants to preserve balance between realms
- Fears both outcomes of the prophecy
- Testing party for larger role in future events

### Ambassador Nerida Deepcurrent
- Genuinely surprised by conspiracy
- Sees opportunity to advance Aquabyssos interests
- Will honor agreements but exploit loopholes

### Marcus "Shardbreaker" Grimm
- Just trying to earn enough for more suppressants
- Can be convinced prophecy threatens everyone
- Potential valuable ally if shown respect

### Prince Caspian Duskwater
- Desperate to save kingdom from his mother
- Doesn't fully understand what he's unleashing
- Can be redeemed or could become major villain

## DM Notes
This quest bridges the gap between the crystal corruption storyline and the introduction of Aquabyssos as a major threat. It provides personal stakes (the prince's family drama), moral complexity (no perfect solution), and connections to multiple factions. The prophecy shards can become recurring plot devices, and the outcome significantly affects the campaign's direction. The investigation structure allows for both combat and social solutions, while the various NPCs provide different approaches to problem-solving.
