## Overview

The Hopekeeper Academy stands as a beacon of learning and resistance in the depths of [[Aquabyssos. Founded by [Miranda Hopekeeper]], this institution secretly trains young minds to resist the spreading corruption while maintaining the facade of a traditional underwater academy. Built within a series of interconnected kelp forests and coral chambers, the school serves both surface and aquatic students seeking to understand the true nature of the shadow magic plaguing their world.

## Physical Description

The academy is ingeniously constructed within a living kelp forest, with buildings woven from cultivated coral and reinforced kelp fronds. The complex consists of:

### [[Miranda Hopekeeper (Headmistress)
*Medium humanoid (half-elf), lawful good*
**AS** 15 (Robes of the Archmagi) **HP** 165 **Speed** 30 ft., swim 30 ft.
**STR** 10 **DEX** 14 **CON** 14 **INT** 20 **WIS** 18 **CHA** 16

A distinguished half-elf with silver hair that seems to shimmer with its own light. Her eyes are pools of deep blue that reflect an ancient wisdom and unwavering hope.

**Spellcasting**: 18th-level spellcaster, spell save **DC 17**, +9 spell attack
**Special Abilities**:
- **Corruption Insight**: Can detect the presence and source of shadow magic within 120 feet
- **Inspiring Presence**: Allies within 30 feet have advantage on saves against fear and corruption
- **Master Educator**: Can cast any divination spell of 3rd level or lower at will

### [Professor Kaine Tidereader]] (Librarian)
*Medium humanoid (triton), neutral good*
An elderly triton who has memorized the contents of every book in the academy. His skin bears intricate tattoos that glow when he accesses different memories.

### [[Coral (Groundskeeper)
*Large plant, neutral*
A sentient coral entity that maintains the living buildings. Can communicate through color changes and water vibrations. Highly protective of students.

### Corruption Intrusion
During periods of high corruption activity:
- **Tainted Currents**: **DC 15** Constitution save or suffer `dice: 1d6` necrotic damage
- **Shadow Whispers**: **DC 14** Wisdom save or be charmed for 1 hour by corruption
- **Knowledge Decay**: Books and memories begin to fade, requiring immediate intervention

### Unstable Magic Zones
Student experiments sometimes create hazardous areas:
- **Wild Magic Surges**: Spells cast have 25% chance of triggering wild magic surge
- **Temporal Eddies**: Time flows differently (1 minute = `dice: 1d4` hours outside)
- **Elemental Rifts**: Random portals to elemental planes

### The Headmistress's Office
[Miranda Hopekeeper]]'s private chambers contain:
- **Staff of the Deep** (+2 quarterstaff, water breathing for wielder and 5 others)
- **Scrolls of Mass Cure Wounds** (x3)
- **Ring of Corruption Ward** (immunity to corruption effects for 1 hour/day)
- **Research Notes**: Detailed studies on corruption sources worth 1,000 gp to scholars

### The Vault of Knowledge
Hidden beneath the academy:
- **Tome of Anti-Corruption Rituals**: Contains 3 unique spells (8th level)
- **Crystal of Pure Memory**: Stores perfect recollections of pre-corruption times
- **Map of Shadow Sources**: Reveals all corruption nexuses in [[Aquabyssos
- **Aethermoor Communication Device**: Allows contact with surface world

### Student Projects
Various magical items created by students:
- **Kelp Rope of Climbing**: Never fails strength checks, 100 ft. length
- **Coral Helmet of Water Breathing**: Functions indefinitely underwater
- **Glowing Pearl of Light**: Casts daylight spell 3x/day
- **Net of Entanglement**: +2 to attack rolls, automatic grapple on hit

### The Missing Student
[Nerissa Depthsong]] disappeared while researching in the [[Deep Trenches. Her last message mentioned discovering something about the corruption's origin. [Miranda Hopekeeper]] needs discrete help finding her.
**Reward**: 750 gp + access to restricted library section

### The Infiltrator
A new student seems to be asking too many questions about the academy's defenses. [[Professor Kaine Tidereader suspects they're a spy for [The Corrupted Admiralty]]. The party must investigate without alerting the suspect.
**Reward**: 400 gp + magical research assistance

### The Fading Knowledge
Books in the library are mysteriously losing their text. The corruption appears to be targeting knowledge itself. The party must travel to the [[Memory Coral Reefs to restore the lost information.
**Reward**: 600 gp + choice of any spell scroll from the library

### The Surface Contact
A message arrives from [Aethermoor]] requesting immediate assistance. The surface world's crystals are failing, and they need the academy's research on corruption resistance. The party must escort [[Miranda Hopekeeper]] on a dangerous journey to the surface.
**Reward**: 1,000 gp + magical items from both worlds

### The Graduation Crisis
Final exams are approaching, but the testing chambers have been corrupted. Students are experiencing nightmare visions during their practical tests. The party must cleanse the chambers and discover who or what is behind the sabotage.
**Reward**: 500 gp + honorary academy membership
