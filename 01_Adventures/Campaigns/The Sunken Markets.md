## Overview
Beneath [[Port Meridian's harbor lies an otherworldly marketplace that exists half-submerged, where air-breathing merchants trade with denizens of the deep. Discovered only two years ago when the Crimson Shard's placement in the harbor caused tidal anomalies, the Sunken Markets have become a crucial but dangerous connection point between Aethermoor and [Aquabyssos]].

## Structure
The Markets occupy a series of partially flooded caves and ruins that predate the current city:

## Laws & Customs
1. No violence in the Exchange Pools (enforced by ancient magic)
2. All trades must be witnessed by a Depth Speaker
3. Blood debts carry over between surface and deep
4. Certain names must not be spoken (invoke deep curses)
5. Iron weapons forbidden (rust corrupts the waters)

## Secrets
> [!warning] DM Only
> - The Western Gate leads to the prison of Thal'mexis, the Sunken Sovereign
> - The Sunken Markets were the original temple complex where the Crown of Stars was created
> - The Crimson Shard in the harbor is slowly awakening something beneath
> - Harbormistress Coral is actually three beings sharing one body
> - The translation crystals are recording all conversations for unknown purposes
> - Several major surface merchants have been replaced by deep-dwelling shapeshifters
> - The tidal anomalies are counting down to a specific convergence event

## Plot Hooks
1. Diplomatic escort for sensitive negotiations between surface and deep
2. Investigate murders that cross between air and water
3. Retrieve stolen artifact that's being sold to highest bidder
4. Stop crystal corruption from spreading to Aquabyssos
5. Discover why refugees are fleeing the deep waters
6. Decode ancient inscriptions revealing the Crown's origin

### Key Locations
1. Main entrance/approach
2. Central gathering area
3. Important buildings/features
4. Defensive positions (if applicable)
5. Hidden or secret areas

## DM Notes
The Sunken Markets serve as the primary interface between the surface world and Aquabyssos, allowing introduction of underwater elements without requiring full aquatic adventures. The location's mix of commerce and danger provides opportunities for social encounters, investigation, and combat. The various factions present create natural conflict and alliance opportunities. The ancient nature of the site connects to the deeper mysteries of both the Seven Shards and the origins of the crystal corruption.
