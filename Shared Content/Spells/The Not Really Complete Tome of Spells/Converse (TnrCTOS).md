## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *divination*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

## Effects
You choose a single natural object or crea-ture, such as a tree, stream, boulder, a bird, etc., and mentally commune with that objectâ€™s spirit.

The DM secretly rolls 2d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier to determine how many questions you may ask. When you ask that number of questions, or 24 hours have passed, the spell ends. The spirit will answer as truthfully as it can, but may be limited in knowledge.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a 7th- or 8th- level spell slot, the GM rolls 3d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier. When you cast this spell with a 9th-level spell slot, the GM rolls 4d6 plus your spellcasting ability modifier.
