## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting (Anathema Form Only).*** The anathema's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: *animal friendship (snakes only)*

3/day each: *darkness, entangle, fear, haste, suggestion, polymorph*

1/day: *divine word*

***Magic Resistance.*** The anathema has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Ophidiophobia Aura.*** Any creature of the anathema's choice, other than a snake or a yuan-ti, that starts its turn within 30 feet of the anathema and can see or hear it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of snakes and yuan-ti. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this aura for the next 24 hours.

***Shapechanger.*** The anathema can use its action to polymorph into a Huge giant constrictor snake, or back into its true form. its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed.

**Six Heads.** The anathema has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on saving throws against being blinded. charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, or knocked unconscious.

***Variant: Acid Slime.*** As a bonus action, the yuan-ti can coat its body in a slimy acid that lasts for 1 minute. A creature that touches the yuan-ti, hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it, or is hit by its constrict attack takes 5 (`dice: 1d10`) acid damage.

***Variant: Chameleon Skin.*** The yuan-ti has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.

***Variant: Shed Skin (1/Day).*** The yuan-ti can shed its skin as a bonus action to free itself from a grapple, shackles, or other restraints. If the yuan-ti spends 1 minute eating its shed skin, it regains hit points equal to half its hit point maximum.

## Actions
***Multiattack (Anathema Form Only).*** The anathema makes two claw attacks, one constrict attack, and one Flurry of Bites attack.

Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 16 (`dice: 3d6+6`) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (`dice: 2d6`) acid damage at the start of each of its turns, and the anathema can't constrict another target.
