## Special Traits
**Charge:** A quadricorn does extra damage with a horn attack if it moved at least 20 feet in a straight line toward the target of the attack. It can trample another target during this move. If the horn attack hits, the target creature takes an extra 13 (`dice: 3d8`) piercing damage and must make a successful DC 14 Strength check or be pushed 5 feet away from the quadricorn and knocked prone.

**Magic Horns:** A quadricorns horns are treated as magic weapons.

**Trample:** As it moves, a quadricorn can trample one Medium or smaller creature. The target creature must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw when the quadricorn moves adjacent. If the saving throw succeeds, the target can move 5 feet to either side, the quadricorn continues moving, and the trample attack has no effect. If the saving throw fails, the target is knocked prone, takes 8 (`dice: 1d8+4`) bludgeoning damage, and the quadricorn can move through the targets space but cant end its turn there.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A quadricorn attacks twice with its horns. The two attacks must be made against separate targets.

**Horns:** *Melee Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (`dice: 1d8+4`) magic, piercing damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate and warm hills and prairies

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
Quadricorns resemble two-headed bulls, although the body is more massive than that of a normal bull, to accommodate the two heads. Unlike unicorns, with their attraction toward virgins, quadricorns have somewhat the reverse propensity; they are known to sometimes charge into towns to find houses of ill repute, where they batter through walls and doors in an attempt to carry off one or two captive “soiled doves.”

In general, quadricorns live in barren wilderness areas, and can even be found making their lairs in caves, although they are not generally found in deep catacombs. The wilderness around a quadricorn’s lair shows signs of the creature’s presence: stretches of ground that are heavily trampled and torn up by hooves, trees with their bark torn off and with deep gouges from horns, even boulders split cleanly in half from unimaginably heavy impact.
