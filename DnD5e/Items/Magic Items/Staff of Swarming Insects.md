## Description
This [[Staff|staff]] has 10 charges and regains `dice: 1d6+4` (1d6+4) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, a [[Swarm of Insects|swarm of insects]] consumes and destroys the staff, then disperses.

***Spells.*** While holding the [[Staff|staff]], you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]]: **[[Giant Insect|giant insect]]** (4 charges) or **[[Insect Plague|insect plague]]** (5 charges).

***Insect Cloud.*** While holding the [[Staff|staff]], you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause a swarm of harmless [[13 - Movement and Position|flying]] insects to spread out in a 30-foot radius from you. The insects remain for 10|minutes, making the area [[9 - The Environment|heavily obscured]] for creatures other than you. The swarm moves with you, remaining centered on you. A wind of at least 10 miles per hour disperses the swarm and ends the effect.

**Versatile**. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
