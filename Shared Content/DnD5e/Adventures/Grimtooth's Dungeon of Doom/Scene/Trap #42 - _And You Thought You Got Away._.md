# Trap #42 - "And You Thought You Got Away."
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> Picture this, the tomb traipser is blazing down the stairs, at the last second he magics the lock in the door, and it flies open to reveal 10 feet away a wall of spears! The look on their faces is priceless! (Disappointingly there is a slim chance of survival, about 20% (L6), from acrobatic contortions out of the way. But if they miss the spears there is still the impact with some other part of the room. This will generate disabling damage in 50% of the cases (L5).
> 
> The spears are 10 feet long and crafted of dwarvish steel. They are set lightly in sockets in the wall and can be easily removed. Due to the craftsmanship involved in their construction they are worth 10 times what spears of this type would be worth. (That's about 400 g.p. each, and there are 30 of them.)
> 
> As competent trap masters you will recqgnize that as difficult as it is there are those who will survive these stairs. Fear not, this room will not let them go that lightly. For those who reach the bottom of the stairs unscathed ( or by virtue of unbelievable constitutions only slightly scathed,) they will have to open the door and enter in a more conventional manner. If they do this they will be treated to the second best part of this trap.
> 
> The party will be naturally surprised when the spears in the far wall do not leap out at them. After a time they will begin to think perhaps these are time released and want to enter the room. A 10 foot by 10 foot square section of the floor just inside [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] is a trap door. When the first party member enters, the floor falls away forward and down, depositing the hapless creature in a 10 by 10 foot by 20 foot deep pit under the floor. The unique thing about this trap, since I know you expect something better than an ordinary hole in the floor from your host, is that the floor section that falls away under the victim's weight is joined by an axle to the section of floor under the wall of spears. As a result when the floor falls the other floor section will pivot upward taking the wall of spears with it. The wall of spears will crash into the wall above the door and the spears will drop into the pit impailing the poor fellow who first entered. (Heavily armored characters may survive; there is a 60% chance (L4) that the spears will not punch through. Keep in mind they're heavy spears & razor sharp!)
> 
> The best part of this trap is that in order to proceed the party must trip the trap, because the wall of spears is the exit to the room!
> 
> If by some mischance the room is entered from the opposite direction this trap will be activated resulting in the spears falling harmlessly into the pit. If old Evinrood was perfect, being a high level wizard, he'd probably still be with us. (An elaboration that suggests itself, would be to put a weight limit on the initial floor section in order to "trap" more delvers. This could backfire however if the party enters one at a time.)
> 
> Once the trap has been tripped the way is open to proceed.
> 
> In concert with the stairs the trap is a 3 skuller, and entered from the Acid fountain side without benefit of speed it is still a two skull trap, but alas if entered from the wrong direction the whole thing is a bust.
