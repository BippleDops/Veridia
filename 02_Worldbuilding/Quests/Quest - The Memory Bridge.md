# Quest - The Memory Bridge
*Connecting Minds Across Realms*

## Overview
A groundbreaking experiment to create a "memory bridge" between [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] has reached a critical juncture. By combining crystal-enhanced communication technology with Aquabyssos memory-sharing techniques, researchers hope to enable people from both realms to share experiences and understanding directly. However, the project faces sabotage, political opposition, and unexpected side effects that threaten to create dangerous psychic contamination.

## Background
### The Memory Bridge Project
