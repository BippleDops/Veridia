# Dwarven Fortitude
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 74*  

**Prerequisite**: [Dwarf](/03_Mechanics/CLI/races/dwarf-xphb.md)

You have the blood of dwarf heroes flowing through your veins. You gain the following benefits:

- Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
- Whenever you take the [Dodge](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Dodge) action in combat, you can spend one Hit Die to heal yourself. Roll the die, add your Constitution modifier, and regain a number of hit points equal to the total (minimum of 1).
