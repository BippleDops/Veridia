# Vanifer

## Lair actions
_Source: Princes of the Apocalypse_

If Vanifer is in the fire node while [Imix](/3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/imix-pota.md) isn't, the tiefling can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Vanifer uses a lair action to cast one of her spells, up to 3rd level, without using components or a spell slot. She can't cast the same spell two rounds in a row, although she can continue to concentrate on a spell she previously cast using a lair action. Vanifer can take no other lair actions while [concentrating](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Concentration) on a spell cast as a lair action. Her favorite use of this capability is casting [fireball](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/fireball-xphb.md) or [hypnotic pattern](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/hypnotic-pattern-xphb.md).

If Vanifer casts [misty step](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/misty-step-xphb.md) using this lair action, she also draws the power of the fire node into herself. By doing so, she regains 15 (`3d8 + 2`) hit points.
