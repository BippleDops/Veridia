# Summon Fey
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/summon-fey.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gilded flower worth 300+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a Fey spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the [Fey Spirit](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/fey-spirit-xphb.md) stat block. When you cast the spell, choose a mood: Fuming, Mirthful, or Tricksy. The creature resembles a Fey creature of your choice marked by the chosen mood, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your [Initiative](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [Dodge](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Dodge) action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.
