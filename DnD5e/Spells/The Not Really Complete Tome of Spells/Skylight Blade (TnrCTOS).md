# Skylight Blade (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
You create a silent, weightless, magical four-foot-long sword made out of moonlight or sunlight, your choice. Only you may use it, and it cannot be dropped. You use your spell attack modifier to hit. On a hit, it does 2d8 + your spellcasting attribute modifier in radiant damage. Against undead, it does 2d12 + twice your spellcasting attribute modifier in radiant damage. This weapon does not leave visible wounds, except on undead; with them, their substance visibly boils away at the weaponâ€™s touch.

If you use a *moonlight blade*, this spell does 2d12 + twice your spellcasting attribute modifier in radiant damage to shapechangers as well as undead.

If you use a *sunlight blade*, anyone hit by this sword must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute.

In addition, on a successful hit, the target must make a saving throw using its spellcasting ability modifier or lose the ability to cast spells the following round. If the target does not have the ability to cast spells, this has no effect.
