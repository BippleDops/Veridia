# Senses

## Blindsight
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 361. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span>_

If you have Blindsight, you can see within a specific range without relying on physical sight. Within that range, you can see anything that isn't behind [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cover-xphb|Total Cover]] even if you have the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Blinded|Blinded]] condition or are in [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/darkness-xphb|Darkness]]. Moreover, in that range, you can see something that has the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Invisible|Invisible]] condition.

## Darkvision
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 365. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span>_

If you have Darkvision, you can see in [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] within a specified range as if it were [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]] and in [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/darkness-xphb|Darkness]] within that range as if it were [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]]. You discern colors in that [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/darkness-xphb|Darkness]] only as shades of gray.

## Tremorsense
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 377. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span>_

A creature with Tremorsense can pinpoint the location of creatures and moving objects within a specific range, provided that the creature with Tremorsense and anything it is detecting are both in contact with the same surface (such as the ground, a wall, or a ceiling) or the same liquid.

Tremorsense can't detect creatures or objects in the air, and it doesn't count as a form of sight.

## Truesight
_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 377. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span>_

If you have Truesight, your vision is enhanced within a specified range. Within that range, your vision pierces through the following:

- **Darkness.** You can see in normal and magical [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/darkness-xphb|Darkness]].  
- **Invisibility.** You see creatures and objects that have the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Invisible|Invisible]] condition.  
- **Visual Illusions.** Visual illusions appear transparent to you, and you automatically succeed on [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/saving-throw-xphb|saving throws]] against them.  
- **Transformations.** You discern the true form of any creature or object you see that has been transformed by magic.  
- **Ethereal Plane.** You see into the Ethereal Plane.

## Player-Facing Summary

Senses is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of senses as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around senses.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties senses to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at senses to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to senses active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
