## Special Traits
***Ice Walk.*** The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra moment.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (`dice: 2d10+6`) piercing damage plus 4 (`dice: 1d8`) cold damage.

***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (`dice: 2d6+6`) slashing damage.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (`dice: 2d8+6`) bludgeoning damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 54 (`dice: 12d8`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Legendary Actions
The Adult White Dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Adult White Dragonregains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Detect.** The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**Tail Attack.** The dragon makes a tail attack.

**Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 ft. of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (`dice: 2d6+6`) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
