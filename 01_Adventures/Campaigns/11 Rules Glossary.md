--- # Rules Glossary

*Source: Adventurer's Codex (2024), p. 360* ## ğŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Glossary Conventions The glossary uses the following conventions: - **Tags in Brackets.** Some entries have a tag in brackets after the entry's name, as in "Attack [Action]." A tagâ€”Action, Area of Effect, Attitude, Condition, or Hazardâ€”indicates that a rule is part of a family of rules. The tags also have glossary entries. - **"You.** " The game's rulesâ€”in this glossary and elsewhereâ€”often talk about something happening to you in the game world. That "you" refers to the creature or object that the rule applies to in a particular moment of play. For example, the "you" in the [[conditions#prone|Prone]] condition is a creature that currently has that condition. - **"See Also.** " Some glossary entries include a See also section that points to other entries in the glossary, to chapters in this book, or both. - **No Obsolete Terms.** The glossary contains definitions of current rules terms only. If you're looking for a term from an earlier version of the fifth edition rules, consult the index. - **Abbreviations.** The abbreviations listed below appear in this glossary and elsewhere in the rules. ![[glossary-conventions-xphb (tables)]] ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/books/players-handbook-2024/img/246-12-001-dungeon-border.webp#center) ## Rules Definitions Here are definitions of various rules. > [!embed-variantrule]- Ability Check

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of 11 rules glossary as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around 11 rules glossary. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A prisoner has gone missing and truth emerges

- A merchant needs help investigating before dawn
- A map reveals ancient history about this place ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
