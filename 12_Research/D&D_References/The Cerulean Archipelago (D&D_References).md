## General Info
**Location**: West of the mainland

## Description
The Cerulean Archipelago is a chain of tropical islands known for their beautiful beaches, lush jungles, and vibrant coral reefs. The islands are also home to many ancient ruins and hidden treasures.

## Player-Facing Summary

The Cerulean Archipelago is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of The Cerulean Archipelago as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around The Cerulean Archipelago.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
