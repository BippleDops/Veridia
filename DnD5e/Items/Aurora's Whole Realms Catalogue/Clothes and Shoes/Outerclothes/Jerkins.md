## Description
Everyone, sooner or later, needs a good jerkin, at least that’s what my mother across Faerun constantly harps. With that in mind, we are proud to offer what we believe is the finest selection of jerkins on Toril. Our basic linen jerkin comes in a variety of colors (we use the best dyes to come out of Baldur’s Gate, to insure colorfastness), and runs 8 sp. For greater warmth try a jerkin constructed from quilted wool for 1 gp. For the truly noble, silk is available, at 80 gp. Rugged folk may prefer a leather jerkin—10 gp each. We also offer a lightweight jerkin made of Maztican cotton (30 gp). 

Options are available on all jerkins, including a specific style of collar, hood, pockets (inside and/or out), and ruffles (sleeves, hemline, and/or collar). Three sp for each extra (15 gp on silk [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Items|items]]). When ordering in linen, wool, cotton, and silk, please specify white, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, brown, or black. Leather comes in only brown or black. Added embroidery costs 15 gp extra for materials and labor.
