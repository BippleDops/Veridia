# Herald at the Threshold
## Overview
### Herald at the Threshold
![[2lfacwtd.k0w.png|Herald at the Threshold|300]]
[[2lfacwtd.k0w.png|open outside]]

*A thing of sublime chaos, this creature seems to have no set form yet is composed of flaccid skin and a trio of grasping, tentacle-like limbs. Its form is partially made of boiling emotions that clothe the thing in waxy flesh. Its great limbs grip at its surroundings, lacerating stone in its grasp, while some sort of fetid opening surrounded by moist bones rises to a set of horns like demented curved instruments through which an agonizing, grating scream tears.*

## Special Traits
**Absorb:** If a creature with 0 hit points fails a death saving throw while a herald at the threshold is in the same space with it, that creature dies and its body is entirely absorbed into the herald’s. The herald gains temporary hit points equal to the creature’s Constitution score. If the herald is subsequently killed, enough of an absorbed creature’s corpse can be recovered for a spell such as resurrection to work, but not revivify or raise dead.

**Dimensional Mastery:** A herald at the threshold can cast dimension door as a bonus action.

**Dislocated:** The herald at the threshold’s form is made up of its memories, which shift and change. The creature is continually under the effect of a blur spell (attacks against it are made with tactical disadvantage unless the attacker has blindsight, truesight, or an equivalent). The herald can suppress or reactivate this ability at will as a bonus action.

**Immune to Transformation:** A herald at the threshold is immune to any effect that would alter its form..

**Magic Resistance (1/day):** When the herald fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

**Spell-like Abilities:** The herald at the threshold can use the following spell-like abilities, using Charisma as its casting ability (DC 16). The herald doesn’t need material components to use these abilities.

*At will:* dimension door, freedom of movement

*3/day each:* blink, counterspell 1/day each: invisibility (self only, duration 1 minute), resilient sphere

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The herald attacks three times with its claws.

**Melee Attack—Claw:** +10 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d6 + 5` slashing damage. If two claw attacks hit the same target on the herald’s turn, that target takes an additional `dice: 3d6` slashing damage and gains 1 level of exhaustion.

**Area Attack—Overwhelming Mind (recharge 5-6):** The herald projects a telepathic assault in a 30-foot cone. Creatures in the cone must make a successful DC 17 Wis saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A paralyzed creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself with a success. In addition, creatures that attempt to make mental contact with a herald, whether telepathically or through spells such as detect thoughts or dominate monster, are immediately subject to this attack.

**Area Attack—Preternatural Horror (1/day):** The herald reveals the full horror of itself to the minds of nearby creatures. All creatures within 60 feet of the herald must make a successful DC 17 Wis saving throw or be afflicted with madness. If the result of the saving throw is 12-16, the creature suffers a shortterm madness; 7-11 results in longterm madness; 6 or less results in indefinite madness. No line of sight or visual contact is needed for this attack to work.

**Area Attack—Screaming Pipes (1/day):** The herald emits a psyche-blasting shriek through its hornlike appendages. All creatures within 30 feet of the herald and capable of hearing it must make a DC 16 Wis saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the creature is stunned for `dice: 1d4` rounds and permanently deafened; if it succeeds, the creature is deafened for `dice: 1d4` rounds and incapacitated until the end of its next turn.

## Legendary Actions
The herald at the threshold can take up to three legendary actions per round. Legendary actions are taken at the end of another creature’s turn, and only one can be taken after each turn.

**Cantrip:** The herald casts an at-will spell.

**Claw:** The herald makes a claw attack.

**Multiattack (costs 2 actions):** The herald makes three claw attacks.
