Welcome to the wonderful world of Obsidian.md for Tabletop RPGs. If you are looking for a better way to manage all your TTRPG information and data, then you are in the right place. It can even be used as a digital tool to manage combat encounters and roll dice. 

One of the biggest advantages of Obsidian.md is that is can be customised to meet your personal requirements. 
One of the biggest disadvantages of Obsidian.md is that is can be customised to meet your personal requirements. 

You see on the surface, Obsidian.md is very very simple to use. But the more you use it, the more you find yourself going "I wish it could do this for me". At that point you go searching for a plugin to help add the functionality you are looking for. When you install a plugin, you increase the complexity of the tool. You increase the learning curve require to learn the tool. This is why you will hear mature Obsidian.md users say that you are in control of the learning curve. 


> [!tip]+ What Does It Cost?
> ==Obsidian.md is free to use for personal use==.
