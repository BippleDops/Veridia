# Sorcerous Burst
*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You cast sorcerous energy at one creature or object within range. Make a ranged attack roll against the target. On a hit, the target takes `d8` damage of a type you choose: Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, Psychic, or Thunder.

If you roll an 8 on a `d8` for this spell, you can roll another `d8`, and add it to the damage. When you cast this spell, the maximum number of these d8s you can add to the spell's damage equals your spellcasting ability modifier.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by `d8` when you reach levels 5 (`2d8`), 11 (`3d8`), and 17 (`4d8`).
