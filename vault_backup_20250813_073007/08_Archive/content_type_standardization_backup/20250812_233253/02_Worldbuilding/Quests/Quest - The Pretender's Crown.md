# Quest - The Pretender's Crown

*The Throne of Aethermoor Stands on a Foundation of Lies*

## Quest Overview

A mysterious figure claiming to be the lost heir of [[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]] has emerged from the [[Crystalline Wastes]], bearing artifacts and knowledge that seem to prove their legitimacy. However, evidence suggests this "heir" may be a construct of shadow magic, a puppet of the [[Shadow-Crystal Synthesis]], or something even more sinister. The party must uncover the truth before the coronation legitimizes a false ruler and plunges Aethermoor into darkness.

The investigation will lead through the highest echelons of nobility, into forgotten royal vaults, and ultimately to a conspiracy that threatens not just the crown but the very nature of reality in Aethermoor. Every ally could be an enemy, every proof could be fabricated, and the truth itself might be more dangerous than the lie.

## The Pretender

### Prince Aurelius Lumengarde
**Public Persona**: The Lost Heir Returned  
**Apparent Age**: 28 years  
**Claim**: Son of Queen Seraphina from secret first marriage  

**Evidence of Legitimacy**:
- Bears the Lumengarde birthmark (crystalline pattern on shoulder)
- Possesses the lost Signet of Storms (missing for 30 years)
- Knows secret royal protocols and passwords
- Can activate bloodline-locked crystal artifacts
- Supported by several noble houses with "recovered memories"

**Suspicious Elements**:
- No records of first marriage exist
- Emerged exactly when succession crisis peaked
- Never removes special gloves (hiding something?)
- Reflection sometimes shows different face
- Animals react with fear despite his charm

### The Truth (DM Only)

The Pretender is actually:
1. **A Perfect Simulacrum** created by the [[Shadow-Crystal Synthesis]] using stolen royal blood and memories
2. **Marina Silversky** in disguise, manipulating events to prevent realm convergence
3. **The Real Heir** but corrupted by shadow during their exile
4. **An Ancient Entity** wearing a constructed body, seeking to reclaim power
5. **Multiple Beings** switching places using identical appearances

(Choose based on campaign needs or roll d6, rerolling 6)

## Act 1: Royal Summons (Levels 10-12)

### The Auditor's Warning
**Location**: Hidden office in [[Port Meridian]]  
**Quest Giver**: [[The Nameless Auditor]]

The Auditor has discovered financial irregularities suggesting the Pretender's supporters are being paid with gold that doesn't exist—shadow gold that vanishes after 30 days. They need investigators who can work outside official channels.

**Initial Tasks**:
1. **Infiltrate Noble Gathering**: Attend Duke Aldridge's ball to observe the Pretender
2. **Investigate Supporters**: Discover why nobles suddenly "remember" the heir
3. **Trace the Gold**: Follow the shadow gold to its source
4. **Test the Birthmark**: Acquire means to verify its authenticity

### The Noble's Ball
**Location**: Duke Aldridge's Crystal Manor  
**Challenge**: Social infiltration and investigation

**Discoveries**:
- Several nobles have new memories that appeared overnight
- The Pretender's reflection in crystal mirrors flickers
- Guards report seeing him in multiple places simultaneously
- A servant whispers about screams from his quarters at night

**Key NPCs**:
- **Duke Aldridge**: Primary supporter, possibly mind-controlled
- **Lady Venetia Silverwind**: Skeptical but afraid to speak
- **Court Wizard Aldwin**: Notices magical anomalies but stays silent
- **The Pretender**: Charming, perfect, slightly wrong

**Complications**:
- Assassination attempt on the Pretender (staged?)
- Party framed for theft of royal artifact
- Memory modification attempted on investigators
- Shadow creatures attack dissenting nobles

## Act 2: The Investigation Deepens (Levels 11-13)

### Royal Archives
**Location**: The Forbidden Wing of the Crystal Palace  
**Objective**: Find proof of the first marriage or its absence

The party must break into the most secure archive in Aethermoor, protected by:
- **Crystal Guardians**: Constructs that detect lies
- **Memory Wards**: Forget why you came if you fail saves
- **Temporal Locks**: Doors that exist in different time periods
- **The Archive Keeper**: Ancient construct with perfect memory

**Discoveries**:
- Marriage records have been expertly altered with shadow ink
- Original documents crumble when exposed to light
- Hidden chamber contains Queen's real diary denying first marriage
- Evidence of previous attempts to claim the throne similarly

### The Bloodline Vault
**Location**: Secret chamber beneath the throne room  
**Objective**: Test the Pretender's blood against the Crown's requirements

**The Test Chamber**:
- Ancient crystal formation that glows for royal blood
- Has been modified recently with shadow crystals
- Original test would kill non-royals instantly
- Current version can be fooled with proper preparation

**Revelations**:
- The Pretender's blood is partially royal (stolen/cloned?)
- Shadow essence mixed with the blood sample
- Previous failed Pretenders' remains hidden here
- Queen Seraphina knew this would happen (prophetic warning)

### The Memory Market
**Location**: [[Memory Merchant Zephyr Mindweaver]]'s shop  
**Objective**: Trace the source of implanted memories

**Investigation Reveals**:
- Bulk purchase of memory modification services
- Memories taken from real but deceased prince
- Shadow corruption in the memory crystals
- Connection to [[The Convergence Seekers]]

## Act 3: The Shadow Conspiracy (Levels 12-14)

### The Puppet Masters
**Discovery**: The Pretender is controlled by multiple factions

**Faction Involvement**:
1. **[[Shadow-Crystal Synthesis]]**: Want puppet ruler for their plans
2. **[[The Convergence Seekers]]**: Believe false king will trigger convergence
3. **Foreign Power**: [[Aquabyssos]] agents destabilizing Aethermoor
4. **Noble Houses**: Gambling on regime change for power
5. **The Pretender**: May be playing all sides

### The Crystal Heart Connection
**Location**: The Heart of Aethermoor  
**Revelation**: The Pretender plans to corrupt the Crystal Heart during coronation

**The Plan**:
- Use coronation ceremony to access Crystal Heart
- Insert shadow shard during the blessing ritual
- Transform all crystal in Aethermoor to shadow crystal
- Create permanent portal to shadow realm

**Gathering Allies**:
- **[[Crystal Wardens]]**: Split between duty and suspicion
- **[[High Priestess Celeste Dawnbringer]]**: Knows religious proofs of falseness
- **Queen's Secret Guard**: Loyal to truth, not throne
- **Common People**: Must be convinced carefully

## Act 4: The Coronation Crisis (Levels 13-15)

### Pre-Coronation Preparation
**Time Limit**: 3 days before ceremony

**Essential Tasks**:
1. **Secure Evidence**: Gather irrefutable proof of deception
2. **Protect Witnesses**: Keep truth-speakers alive
3. **Disable Contingencies**: Prevent shadow portal activation
4. **Rally Support**: Ensure intervention won't cause civil war

### The Coronation Day
**Location**: The Crystal Cathedral  
**Climax**: Public revelation or secret prevention

**Possible Approaches**:

#### Public Confrontation
- Interrupt ceremony with evidence
- Force public test of legitimacy
- Risk civil war but ensure transparency

### The Final Battle

**The Pretender's True Form**:
Depending on earlier discoveries, the Pretender reveals:

**If Simulacrum**: Melts into shadow-crystal hybrid monster (CR 15)
- Abilities: Shape-shifting, memory drain, crystal corruption
- Weakness: True name dispels form

**If Marina**: Desperate attempt to explain while fighting (CR 13)
- Abilities: Memory magic, dimensional shifts, emotional manipulation
- Resolution: Can be redeemed or must be stopped

**If Corrupted Heir**: Tragic battle against fallen prince (CR 14)
- Abilities: Royal artifacts, shadow powers, legitimate commands
- Resolution: Purification possible but difficult

**If Ancient Entity**: Cosmic horror emerges (CR 16)
