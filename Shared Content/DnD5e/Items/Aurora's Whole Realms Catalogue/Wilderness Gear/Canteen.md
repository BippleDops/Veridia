## Description
Keep plenty of fluids handy when you’re on your own in the wilderness with our collection of skins and canteens. We offer a basic one gallon water- or wineskin, made of sheep’s bladder (8 sp), as well as a larger three gallon skin for you really thirsty folk (2 gp). We also would like to tell you about a new item, a personal canteen. This is a stoppered wooden tank, lined with sheep’s bladder and covered in thick wool. It holds one-half gallon, but will keep your drink cold longer. A handy shoulder strap is attached for easy carrying, and it is better protected against bursting if dropped. This nifty device is available for 5 gp.
