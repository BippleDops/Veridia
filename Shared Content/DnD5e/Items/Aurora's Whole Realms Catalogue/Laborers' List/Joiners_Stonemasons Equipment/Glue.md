## Description
I find it ironic that even our most lofty edifices are held together by ground horse hooves, sandy lime, and foul-smelling tar. For joiners and masons, though, this truth is self evident. Our wood glue 3 gp/lb) sets up in 1 hour and bonds any porous substance permanently to any other. Our [[Pestle|mortar]] comes dry 5 cp/lb), also sets in 1 hour, and can be used with any stony material, or as an exterior coating to wood frames. Our pitch (1 sp/lb) is perfect for sealing leaky roofs or patching tiles in place.

## Additional Details
a wood glue bond holds up to 30 points of Str after dried (e.g., between a sleeping guardâ€™s pants and his chair)
