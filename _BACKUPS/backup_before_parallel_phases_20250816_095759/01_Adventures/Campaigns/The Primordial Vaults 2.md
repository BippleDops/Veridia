# The Primordial Vaults - The First Prison

## Overview
Deep beneath Aquabyssos World Overview, older than the drowned civilizations above, lie the Primordial Vaults - a massive complex of chambers and passages that predate human civilization. Built by unknown hands for unclear purposes, the vaults contain horrors, treasures, and answers to questions that should never be asked. The architecture defies physics, with gravity, time, and space functioning irregularly.

## Vault Sections

### The Threshold Gates (8000 feet)
Seven massive doors, each requiring different keys or rituals to open. [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Vault Keeper Eternal guards the entrance, neither alive nor dead, speaking only in riddles about "the necessity of drowning."

### The Hall of Untime
Corridor where time flows backward, forward, and sideways simultaneously. Those who enter may emerge younger, older, or multiplied into temporal echoes. [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Chronomancer Paradox]] exists here in seventeen versions of himself.

### The Genesis Chambers
Laboratories containing failed experiments in creating life. Twisted proto-creatures still writhe in crystalline tanks. [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The First Failure, a sentient mistake, pleads for death or freedom.

### The Inverse Cathedral
A cathedral built upside-down, where prayers spoken become curses and holy water burns like acid. [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Anti-Priest Nullus]] conducts backwards sermons to an congregation of shadows.

### The Memory Core
Central chamber containing crystallized memories of the world's creation. Touching them grants knowledge but steals personal memories in exchange. [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Forgotten One dwells here, made entirely of stolen memories.

### The Deepest Lock
The final chamber, sealed with thirteen locks, each key hidden throughout Aquabyssos. Behind it lies something that [02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Great Drowning]] was meant to keep imprisoned.

## Vault Inhabitants

### Original Prisoners
- **The Unmaker**: Entity that dissolves reality around it
- **The Dream Eater**: Feeds on sleeping minds across Aquabyssos
- **The First Betrayer**: The original architect, imprisoned in their creation
- **Echo of Creation**: Fragment of whatever force made the world

### Corrupted Guardians
- **Vault Keeper Eternal**: Immortal guardian of the entrance
- **The Wardens of Stone**: Golems that reassemble when destroyed
- **Paradox Sentinels**: Beings that exist in multiple timelines
- **The Null Guards**: Entities that erase things from existence

### Lost Explorers
- **The Depth Touched**: Explorers transformed by vault energies
- **Memory Thieves**: Those who stayed too long in the Memory Core
- **The Multiplication**: Single explorer split into hostile duplicates
- **Void Scholars**: Researchers who learned too much

## Artifacts Within

### The Creation Tablets
Stone tablets describing how to create and destroy worlds. Written in a language that damages the mind to read.

### The First Key
Master key that allegedly opens any lock in existence, including metaphysical ones like death or fate.

### The Unwater
Liquid that undoes the drowning wherever it touches, but spreads madness with its use.

### The Original Sin
Physical manifestation of the first wrongdoing, touching it reveals your worst nature.

### The Cage of Gods
Empty prison that once held deities. Their escape may have triggered the drowning.

## Phenomena

### Gravity Wells
Areas where gravity pulls in impossible directions, creating Escher-like navigation challenges.

### Temporal Storms
Violent distortions aging or reversing anything caught within.

### Reality Bleeds
Places where other dimensions leak through, bringing alien geometries and entities.

### Memory Hurricanes
Psychic storms that scramble memories and personalities of those caught within.

### The Void Pools
Black water that doesn't reflect anything - falling in erases you from history.

## Hazards
- Architecture that rearranges when not observed
- Doors that lead to different places depending on who opens them
- Air that becomes solid, water that becomes gaseous
- Sounds that physically manifest as creatures
- Light that causes madness, darkness that grants clarity

2. Tremors suggesting something massive stirring in the Deepest Lock

Legends speak of The Primordial Vaults as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Primordial Vaults.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties The Primordial Vaults to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
