# Books Overview
 
You can obtain Boioks in a Markdown format that is supported by Obsidian from this site: https://5e.tools/books.html

Simply select a Book that you own and wish to use, open it and use the options to download as Markdown. 
You can either download the Chapter or the whole Adventure. 

> [!note]+ Images
> Note: The Markdown file does not include images. See [[How To - Obtain Images]] for instructions on downloading the images. Review the downloaded Markdown file to determine where the images need to go. 
> For example:
> This path shows where the images are expected to be. 
> `![](img/rules/Point-of-Origin.png)`
> 
> In Obsidian you should therefore store the images in the following path:
> Vault/img/rules/`place images here`
