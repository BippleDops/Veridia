### Trail Boots (Pic)

## Description
No trail is easy upon the feetâ€” most produce callouses, cuts, blisters, bulging veins, and even flat feet. For those who suffer from these ailments, we stock trail boots. These ingenious boots contain sandpaper to rub away callouses as you walk, plumes to tickle your feet into arching, and silk pads to absorb the shock of the trail. These all reside upon a hardwood sole that prevents the monotonous flexing of fragile foot joints, and thick leather uppers. Comfortable though they are, I find myself incapable of motion when wearing them. The gnomish cobbler who makes them, however, gets about quite easily despite his injured back. (5 gp)

## Additional Details
Wt 5 lb; slow movement by half; -4 to Dex when worn; each five days of wear temporarily reduces Con and Str by 1 due to back pain
