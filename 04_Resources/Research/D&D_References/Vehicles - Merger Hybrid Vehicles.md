--- # Merger Hybrid Vehicles Impossible vessels for zones where physics fails and timelines knot. Requires close coordination with [[Complete Reality Merger System, [Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]], [[Deep Mother, and [Memory Trading Economy System|Memory Trading Economy]]. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Procedures

1) Identify zone type from [[Complete Reality Merger System
2) Select compatible vessel mode; allocate anchors
3) Choose navigation method (probability, memory, sanity, dream)
4) Roll stability, sanity, and paradox; resolve anomalies See: [Vessel_Horror_Intensifier|Vessel Horror Intensifier]], [[Journey_Event_Compiler|Journey Event Compiler]]. ## Player-Facing Summary Merger Hybrid Vehicles is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Merger Hybrid Vehicles as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Merger Hybrid Vehicles. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Alliance - Manipulate succession ## Plot Hooks - Someone is searching for a artifact for love

- A journal reveals a betrayal about a local noble
- Someone is hunting a artifact for power ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
