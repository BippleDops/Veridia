A covert rescue operation where characters must extract a high-value prisoner from a heavily guarded facility without alerting the captors. The mission requires stealth, planning, and precise execution, as discovery would trigger diplomatic crisis or worse. The target is a foreign diplomat's daughter held by extremists, and failure could lead to international war. ## Mission Parameters

**Target**: Lady Catherine Brighttide, daughter of surface world ambassador
**Location**: Abandoned mining facility converted to secret prison
**Captors**: Anti-surface extremist group with government sympathizers
**Time Limit**: 48 hours before public execution
**Stealth Requirement**: Rescue must appear to be prisoner escape, not outside intervention ## The Prisoner

**Name**: Lady Catherine Brighttide, age 22
**Background**: Diplomatic envoy studying underwater culture
**Capture Reason**: Symbol of surface world "corruption" to extremists
**Current Condition**: Physically unharmed but psychologically stressed
**Special Considerations**: Knows sensitive diplomatic information ## The Facility

**Structure**: Multi-level complex carved into underwater cliff
**Security**: 20+ guards, magical wards, trained sea creatures
**Layout**: Administrative level, prisoner cells, guard quarters, command center
**Defenses**: Alarm systems, reinforced blast doors, emergency lockdown procedures ## Security Details

**Guard Shifts**: Three rotating teams of 6-8 personnel each
**Patrol Schedule**: Predictable routes every 20 minutes
**Magical Security**: Ward stones detecting unauthorized magic use
**Communication**: Regular check-ins with outside command
**Emergency Protocol**: Immediate lockdown and prisoner elimination if discovered ## Mission Planning

**Intelligence Gathering**: Study facility layout, guard routines, security systems
**Equipment Preparation**: Non-lethal weapons, stealth gear, lock picks
**Entry Strategy**: Multiple options including underwater approach, maintece tunnels
**Extraction Route**: Planned escape path avoiding all security checkpoints
**Cover Story**: False evidence making rescue appear to be prisoner's plan ## Key NPCs

**Commander Reef Hardcurrent**: Facility security chief, professional soldier
**The Extremist Leader**: Fanatic driving the kidnapping plot
**Guard Captain Marina**: Sympathetic guard who might be turned
**Intelligence Contact**: Government agent providing inside information
**Prisoner's Father**: Ambassador driving diplomatic pressure for resolution ## Infiltration Options

**Underwater Approach**: Swimming through mining tunnels to facility foundation
**Supply Delivery**: Concealment in regular supply shipment
**Guard Impersonation**: Replacing guards during shift rotation

**Technical Tools**: Lock picks, ward disruptors, communication scramblers
**Emergency Supplies**: Medical kit, escape equipment, disguise materials
**Intelligence Devices**: Surveillance equipment, document copying tools ## Execution Phase

**Phase 1**: Infiltrate facility during guard shift change
**Phase 2**: Locate prisoner while avoiding detection
**Phase 3**: Extract prisoner and plant false evidence
**Phase 4**: Escape facility without triggering alarms
**Phase 5**: Deliver prisoner to safe location ## Failure Consequences

**Prisoner Death**: International incident, possible war declaration
**Discovery**: Characters become wanted criminals, diplomatic breakdown
**Guard Casualties**: Government disavows mission, characters abandoned
**Incomplete Extraction**: Prisoner remains captive, security increased
**Intelligence Compromise**: Future operations compromised ## Alternative Approaches

**Negotiation**: Attempt diplomatic solution through intermediaries
**Prisoner Exchange**: Trade extremist members for diplomat's daughter
**False Flag**: Make rescue appear to be rival faction's operation
**Infiltration**: Long-term undercover placement to extract prisoner gradually
**Distraction**: Create external crisis to draw security away ## Adventure Hooks

1. Characters recruited by government intelligence service
2. Prisoner's family makes private appeal for help
3. Underground resistance seeks assistance with rescue operation
4. Characters witness kidnapping and feel morally compelled to act ## Long-term Impact

Successful rescue improves diplomatic relations and establishes characters as capable covert operatives. Failure could destabilize regional politics and create ongoing enemies. ## DM Notes
