--- # Confusion

*4th-level, Enchantment* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (three nut shells)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute Each creature in a 10-foot-radius [[Area of Effect Xphb]] centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or that target can't take Bonus Actions or Reactions and must roll`d10`at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn, consulting the table below.`dice: [](confusion-xphb.md#^1-behavior-for-the-turn)`| dice: 1d10 | Behavior for the Turn |

|------------|-----------------------|
| 1 | The target doesn't take an action, and it uses all its movement to move. Roll`d4`for the direction: **1**, north; **2**, east; **3**, south; or **4**, west. |
| 2-6 | The target doesn't move or take actions. |
| 7-8 | The target doesn't move, and it takes the [[actions#Attack|Attack]] action to make one melee attack against a random creature within reach. If none are within reach, the target takes no action. |
| 9-10 | The target chooses its behavior. |

^1-behavior-for-the-turn At the end of each of its turns, an affected target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The [[Area of Effect Xphb]]'s radius increases by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 4. **Classes**: [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 253.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of confusion xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around confusion xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[Master_Spell_Compendium]]
