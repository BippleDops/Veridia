# Fabricate
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, or clothes from flax or wool.

Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot [[cube-area-of-effect-xphb|Cube]] or eight connected 5-foot Cubes) given a sufficient quantity of material. If you're working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a 5-foot [[cube-area-of-effect-xphb|Cube]]). The quality of any fabricated objects is based on the quality of the raw materials.

Creatures and magic items can't be created by this spell. You also can't use it to create items that require a high degree of skillâ€”such as weapons and armorâ€”unless you have proficiency with the type of [[artisans-tools-xphb|Artisan's Tools]] used to craft such objects.
