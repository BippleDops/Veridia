## Description
Also called checkers, this game uses the same board as [[Chess|chess]], and is found from Neverwinter to Mulhorand and beyond. Where [[Chess|chess]] is complicated and drawn out, draughts can be learned in moments and quickly played. I offer a set of stone pieces in red and black on a marble board, suitable for those early winter evenings with hearth and friends. A popular game at a popular priceâ€”5 gp for the fine set!
