--- # Expertise

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 367. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* Expertise is a feature that enhances your use of a skill proficiency. When you make an ability check with a skill proficiency in which you have Expertise, your [[Proficiency Xphb is doubled for that check unless the bonus is doubled by another feature. If you gain Expertise, you gain it in one [boon-of-skill-xphb (feats)]] in which you have proficiency. You can't have Expertise in the same skill proficiency more than once. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Expertise xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
