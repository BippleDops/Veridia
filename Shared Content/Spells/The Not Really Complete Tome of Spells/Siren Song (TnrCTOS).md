# Siren Song (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 300 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a large conch shell and a pint of water)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


## Effects
You choose one humanoid target within range that you can see. That target hears haunting, beautiful music and must make a Wisdom saving throw or become overwhelmed with the need to find the source.

As the music is illusory, it has no actual source and so the target will wander aimlessly.

The target will ignore all distractions and will attempt to walk through any obstacle that isn’t an obvious danger. If the target’s companions keep him from finding the source of the music, the target will fight them.
