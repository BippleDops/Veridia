_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_ The region containing an adult or ancient copper dragon's lair is changed by its presence, creating the following effects: - **Chatty Critters.** Tiny Beasts magically gain the ability to speak and understand Draconic while within 6 miles of the lair. - **Giggle Fits.** Whenever a creature other than the dragon and its allies is within 1 mile of the lair and rolls a 1 on a [[d20-test-xphb (variant-rules)]], it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] condition until the end of its next turn, as it is wracked with laughter. If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. ## Player-Facing Summary Copper dragon xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of copper dragon xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around copper dragon xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - An heirloom has gone missing and truth emerges
