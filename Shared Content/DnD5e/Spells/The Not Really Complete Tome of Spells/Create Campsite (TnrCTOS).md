# Create Campsite (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *conjuration*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (30-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (a bit of string, a bit of wood, and a drop of water)

**Duration**: 10 minutes


## Effects
You create a squadron of tiny unseen servants that create a campsite for you and your companionsâ€”they will clear the land of debris, set up tents and bedrolls, start a fire, fetch water, and even begin cooking (they are not particularly good cooks, however). They cannot create the materials needed for the campsite; they can only use what is available to them in the immediate area and what you and your companions have brought. These servants have no other abili-ties.
