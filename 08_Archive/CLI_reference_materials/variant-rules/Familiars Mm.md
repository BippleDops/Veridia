# Familiars
*Source: Monster Manual p. 347* 

Any spellcaster that can cast the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/find-familiar-xphb|find familiar]] spell (such as an apprentice, warlock, or wizard) is likely to have a familiar. The familiar can be one of the creatures described in the spell (see the "Player's Handbook") or some other Tiny monster, such as a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/crawling-claw-xmm|crawling claw]], an [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/imp-xmm|imp]], a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/pseudodragon-xmm|pseudodragon]], or a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/quasit-xmm|quasit]].

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
