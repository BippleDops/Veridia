## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting (1/Day).*** The mephit can innately cast dancing lights, requiring no material components. Its innate spellcasting ability is Charisma.

***Death Burst.*** When the mephit dies, it leaves behind a cloud of smoke that fills a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on its space. The sphere is heavily obscured. Wind disperses the cloud, which otherwise lasts for 1 minute.

## Actions
***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (`dice: 1d4+2`) slashing damage.

***Cinder Breath (Recharge 6).*** The mephit exhales a 15-foot cone of smoldering ash. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of the mephit's next turn.

***Variant: Summon Mephits (1/Day).*** The mephit has a 25% summoning chance chance of summoning `dice: 1d4` mephits of its kind. A summoned mephit appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other mephits. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

## Description
Smoke mephits are crude, lazy creatures of air and fire that billow smoke constantly. They rarely speak the truth and love to mock and mislead other creatures.
