# Doctor Helena Voidwalker
*The Void Surgeon, Mistress of Life and Death, The Ethical Paradox*

## Overview
Dr. Helena Voidwalker represents the cutting edge of medical research in [[Aquabyssos]], pushing the boundaries of healing magic by incorporating void energy and necromantic principles. Once a celebrated healer, her controversial methods have made her a pariah among traditional healers, yet her results are undeniably effective. She operates from the depths of the research institute, where she treats the untreatable and explores the thin line between life and death.

## Appearance
- **Build**: Tall and angular at 5'9", moves with surgical precision
- **Age**: 42
- **Distinguishing Features**:
  - **Prematurely silver hair** streaked with void-black
  - **Heterochromic eyes**: One brown (natural), one violet-black (void-touched)
  - **Surgical scars**: Deliberate geometric patterns on her arms from void experiments
  - **Void marks**: Dark veins visible beneath pale skin when using power
- **Attire**: Modified medical robes with void-resistant padding, utility belt with surgical tools

## Personality
- **Core Traits**: Brilliant, compassionate yet ruthless, obsessed with progress
- **Medical Philosophy**: "Death is merely another disease to be cured"
- **Values**: Knowledge, results, pushing boundaries, saving lives at any cost
- **Fears**: Losing more patients to preventable causes, becoming fully corrupted by void
- **Quirk**: Talks to corpses during autopsies as if they can still hear her

## Background
Originally a traditional healer in the mid-depths medical district, Helena's life changed when a void leak contaminated her clinic during emergency surgery on void-touched patients. Instead of fleeing, she stayed to save her patients and was permanently changed by the exposure. Her subsequent research into combining void energy with healing magic revolutionized treatment of impossible cases, but at the cost of her reputation and acceptance by her peers.
