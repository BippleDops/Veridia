# Shield of the Silver Dragon
*Armor ([shield](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/shield-xphb.md)), major, rare*  


- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While holding this shield, you have a +2 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.

The shield is emblazoned with a stylized silver dragon that is the emblem of the Order of the Silver Dragon (see *Curse of Strahd*, chapter 7). The shield whispers warnings to its bearer, granting a +2 bonus to initiative if the bearer isn't [incapacitated](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Incapacitated).

A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.
