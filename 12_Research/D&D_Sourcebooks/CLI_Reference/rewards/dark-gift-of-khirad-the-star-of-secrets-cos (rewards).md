# Dark Gift of Khirad, the Star of Secrets
*Charm*  

Khirad's gift is the power of divination. This gift allows its beneficiary to cast the [[Scrying Xphb]] spell as an action. After it has been used three times, the dark gift vanishes.

The beneficiary's voice becomes a low whisper, and its smile becomes cruel and evil.
