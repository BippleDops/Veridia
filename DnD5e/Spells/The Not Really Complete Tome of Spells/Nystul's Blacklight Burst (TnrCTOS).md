# Nystul's Blacklight Burst (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a bit of dirt from a ghoulâ€™s grave)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You bring forth a blast of dark energy from the Negative Plane, sending it to a point you choose within range, at which point expands in a burst. Each creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 necrotic damage and have its speed reduced to half for 1 minute on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one and have its speed reduced by 5 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.
