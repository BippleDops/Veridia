## Special Traits
**Agile Grappler:** A volt uses its Dexterity (Acrobatics) score to oppose attempts to escape from its grapple. The volt cant move a creature it grapples, but it moves with the grappled creature. If the grapple is broken, the volt immediately moves 5 feet into an adjacent, empty space.

## Actions
**Bite:*** Melee Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d6+3`) piercing damage and the volt enters the targets space and grapples the target. The volt cant use its bite attack while it is grappling a creature.

**Tail Slap:** *Melee Attack:* automatic hit, one creature already grappled by the volt at the start of the volts turn. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d6+2`) lightning damage. A creature reduced to 0 hp by this attack is unconscious and stable, not dying.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Underground

**Organization**: Mob (2–12) or swarm (10–20)

## Description
The origin of the volt is unknown, despite the effort of many learned scholars to trace its roots. They are referred to as “bolt wurms” in certain old grimoires for their ability to deliver a jolt of electricity with their whiplike tail. Volts were once thought to be from another plane or another planet, but recent evidence suggests they are from the Material Plane. Other than that, the volt remains largely a mystery.

Volts inhabit very deep caverns and caves, preferring to lair in areas with plentiful water. They are never found alone, and usually travel in threateningly large groups.

It’s anyone’s guess which are volts are male and which are female, if such a distinction actually means anything where volts are concerned.

A volt’s “head” (it’s actually both head and body) is about 2 feet in diameter. The tail is 3 feet long and is mostly tough cartilage and thin, powerful muscles. Its mouth is impossible to see until it opens; then it can be spotted on the underside of the body. It resembles the circular mouth of a lamprey or certain types of blood-sucking worms, and is lined with multiple rows of needlesharp teeth.

Volts are very aggressive. They attack by latching onto a foe, then shocking the creature repeatedly with their electrified tails until it passes out. Once the creature is unconscious, they suck out its blood and other fluids at their leisure.
