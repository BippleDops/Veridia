## Description
A bonesucker is a bizarre creature that stalks the darkness dank caves and remote wastelands. The body is encased in a thick, rubbery sheath of flesh and muscle that makes the bonesucker highly resistant to injury. The bonesucker moves through the use of five thick tentacles at its base.

Bonesuckers consume only the bones of an opponent by grabbing it and piercing its flesh with hollow tentacles. The tentacles inject digestive enzymes into the bones, which break down and are sucked up as a pasty meal for the bonesucker. The process is horrifyingly painful for victims. Experienced adventurers always know they are nearing the hunting grounds of a bonesucker, because the creature leaves the boneless carcasses of its meals lying where it finished them.

Bonesuckers stand about 10 feet tall.

A bonesucker attacks with its tentacles. Initially, the tentacles appear to be only a foot or two in length, but the bonesucker can extend them to a length of approximately 10 feet. It can attack with up to four of its eight tentacles in a single round.

A bonesuckerâ€™s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunities.
