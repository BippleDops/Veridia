# 🏰 Shadowhaven
*The City of Crossed Destinies*

## Overview
Shadowhaven stands as the premier trade city of the region, where merchant caravans converge and arcane energies flow like rivers through specially designed channels. Built at the confluence of three major trade routes, the city has grown into a sprawling metropolis of opportunity and intrigue.

## Districts

### 🚢 Lower Docks
*Population: 8,000 | Danger: ⚠️⚠️⚠️*

The beating heart of Shadowhaven's economy. Massive cargo ships dock here daily, bringing goods from across the known world. The area buzzes with activity from dawn to dusk, with longshoremen, merchants, and travelers creating a constant symphony of commerce.

**Notable Locations:**
- **The Salty Anchor Tavern** - Where deals are made over ales
- **Harbormaster's Office** - Regulated chaos of shipping manifests  
- **Warehouse District** - Maze of storage facilities and hidden passages

### 🏪 Merchant Quarter  
*Population: 12,000 | Danger: ⚠️⚠️*

Gleaming shops and prosperous businesses line wide, well-maintained streets. The Guild Hall stands at the center, its brass dome visible from anywhere in the quarter. Street performers and town criers add color to the organized prosperity.

**Notable Locations:**
- **Guild Hall** - Seat of political and economic power
- **The Golden Bazaar** - Open-air market with exotic goods
- **Brightwater Exchange** - Premier banking and currency exchange

### 👑 Noble Heights
*Population: 3,000 | Danger: ⚠️*

Perched on the highest hill, elegant mansions overlook the city below. Manicured gardens and private guards create an atmosphere of refined security. The truly wealthy shape the city's destiny from these marble halls.

- **The Crystal Conservatory** - Exclusive social club
- **Temple of Prosperity** - Where nobles pray for continued fortune

### 🔮 Arcane District
*Population: 5,000 | Danger: ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️*

Mystical energy crackles through the air here. Ancient towers spiral skyward, their purposes known only to the mages within. Apprentices scurry between buildings carrying glowing reagents while masters conduct experiments that occasionally light up the night sky.

**Notable Locations:**

### 🌑 The Undercity
*Population: 17,000 | Danger: ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️*

Beneath Shadowhaven's gleaming surface lies another city entirely. A labyrinth of tunnels, abandoned buildings, and hidden chambers where those who can't or won't live in the light above make their homes. Information is currency here.

**Notable Locations:**
- **The Whispering Gallery** - Underground tavern and information exchange
- **Tunnel Network** - Secret passages connecting across the city
- **The Black Market** - Where anything can be bought for the right price

## Government & Politics

The **Council of Guilds** governs Shadowhaven through a careful balance of economic interests. Each major guild elects a representative who serves a three-year term. Current council members:

- **Master Thorne Blackforge** (Crafters Union) - *Infrastructure*  
- **Archmage Celestine Starweaver** (Arcane Collective) - *Magical Affairs*
