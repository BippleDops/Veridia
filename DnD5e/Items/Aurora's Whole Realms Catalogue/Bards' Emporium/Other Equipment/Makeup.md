## Description
An aged sage once said, “Actors without makeup seem only walking spoons upon the stage.” Our makeup kit includes coal dust and tar for blackening features and adding dramatic lines; cochineal powder from Maztica for reddening lips and cheeks; flour for lightening features; oil to add gloss; goat-hair mustaches and beards; blonde, brown, black, and gray wigs; resin for hair application; skin putty to lengthen noses or add circles beneath eyes; and a slippery liquid useful for washing off all substances.
