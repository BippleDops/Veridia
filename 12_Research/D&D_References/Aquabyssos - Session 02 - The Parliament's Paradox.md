## ðŸŽ­ Strong Start
The party enters the Debate Chambers to find themselves already there, participating in a debate that hasn't happened yet. Their future selves are voting on something called the "Shadow Accords," and one future party member is visibly a shadow wearing their skin.

### Scene 1: The Temporal Overlap
**Location**: Main Debate Floor
**Situation**: Navigate overlapping timelines in the chamber
**Conflict**: Must avoid paradox while gathering information

#### Timeline Navigation
- **Past Section**: Yesterday's failed vote to restrict shadows
- **Present Section**: Current confusion and investigation
- **Future Section**: Tomorrow's Shadow Accords passage

**Skill Challenges**:
- History DC 15: Recognize temporal inconsistencies
- Stealth DC 14: Avoid future selves' notice
- Investigation DC 13: Find timeline anchor points

**Discoveries**:
- The debate happens tomorrow
- Future party looks defeated/corrupted
- One senator exists in three timelines simultaneously

### Scene 2: The Forgotten Faction
**Location**: The Amnesia Gallery
**Situation**: Meeting with senators who've forgotten themselves
**Conflict**: Communicate with people who forget mid-conversation

#### The Forgotten
These senators have voluntarily erased their memories to avoid something worse. They speak in riddles and prophecy:

**Communication Challenge**:
- Round 1: Establish identity (Persuasion DC 13)
- Round 2: Maintain their attention (Performance DC 14)
- Round 3: Extract information (Insight DC 15)

**What They Remember**:
- "The shadows won before, will win again"
- "Seven harvests, seven failures, seven times forgotten"
- "The Protocol erases solutions with the problems"
- "She who casts no shadow knows the way"

**Discovery**: The Forgotten remember things that haven't happened and seven previous shadow harvests

### Scene 3: The Vote Vaults Investigation
**Location**: Lower Parliament - The Weight of Law
**Situation**: Investigating altered voting records
**Conflict**: Guardian constructs made of crystallized law

#### Vault Exploration
The vaults physically manifest the weight of decisions:
- Pearl votes (yes) make areas lighter
- Obsidian votes (no) make areas heavier
- Altered votes create gravity distortions

**Environmental Puzzle**:
- Navigate gravity shifts to reach Timeline B section
- Disable law constructs without destroying evidence
- Decode the altered voting patterns

**Discoveries**:
- Shadow votes counting double
- Non-existent senators being added
- Timeline B contains votes from erased timeline

### Scene 4: The Shadow Senator
**Location**: Private Meeting Chamber
**Situation**: Confronted by Glaucus's shadow, now independent
**Conflict**: Shadow offers alliance or threatens exposure

#### The Shadow's Offer
Glaucus's Shadow proposes:
- Information about the Inversion
- Protection from shadow replacement
- Access to shadow-only areas

In Exchange:
- Don't interfere with tomorrow's vote
- Help shadows gain citizenship
- Or be exposed as surface spies

**Discovery**: Shadow Duchess Nyx is coming to investigate

## ðŸŽ¯ Secrets & Clues
1. The Shadow Accords will legalize shadow replacement
2. Twelve senators are already shadows
3. The Forgotten remember a weapon against shadows
4. Timeline manipulation is causing reality fractures
5. The Emperor knows but is too fragmented to act
6. Shadow Duchess Nyx has agents in the Parliament
7. Tenebrarum is planning something for the vote
8. The party's arrival was orchestrated by someone
9. Marina has been meeting with shadow dissidents
10. The Protocol is a mass memory wipe system

## ðŸŽ¬ Cliffhanger Ending
During the night, the party witnesses their shadows having a meeting without them, using shadow-speech the party can't understand. Marina's shadow appears independently: "The Duchess arrives tomorrow. Your shadows have already voted to replace you. You have six hours to choose: join willingly, or be harvested. Oh, and that vote you saw today? You already lost it. You just don't remember yet."

## ðŸŽ² Quick Adjustments

**If Running Short on Time**:
- Skip the Vote Vaults investigation
- Have shadow confrontation during Forgotten meeting

**If Players Struggle with Temporal Mechanics**:
- Provide temporal anchor early
- Chronus becomes more helpful
- Reduce paradox penalties

**If Players Create Major Paradox**:
- Embrace itâ€”make it part of story
- Timeline shifts to alternate version
- Future selves arrive to fix it

> *Remember: This session is about inevitability and choice. The future seems set, but player actions can still change everythingâ€”at a cost.*
