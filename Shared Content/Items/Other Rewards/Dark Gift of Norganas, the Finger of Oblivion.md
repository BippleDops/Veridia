## Overview: 
Norganas's gift is the power to turn life into undeath. This dark gift allows its beneficiary to cast the [[finger of death]] spell as an action. After it has been used three times, the dark gift vanishes. When it vanishes, the beneficiary must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.

This dark gift turns the beneficiary's blood pitch black and viscid, like tar.
