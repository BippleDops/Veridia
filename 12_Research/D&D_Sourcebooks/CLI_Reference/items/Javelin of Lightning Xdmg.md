## Lightning Bolt

When you throw this weapon at a target no farther than 120 feet from you, you can forgo making a ranged attack roll and instead turn the weapon into a bolt of lightning. This bolt forms a 5-foot-wide [[Area of Effect Xphb]] between you and the target. The target and each other creature in the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] (excluding you) makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking `4d6` Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Immediately after dealing this damage, the weapon reappears in your hand. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
