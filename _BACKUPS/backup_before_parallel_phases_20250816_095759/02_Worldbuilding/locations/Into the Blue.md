## Overview
An exploration quest that takes players into the unmapped depths of the ocean beyond Aquabyssos's charted territories. This dangerous expedition seeks to uncover the truth behind mysterious phenomena detected at the edge of known waters.

Recent deep-sea monitoring has detected strange signals, unusual current patterns, and unidentified massive objects moving in the deepest parts of the ocean.

## Quest Background
