# Archivist Mnemonic the Forgotten
*Keeper of What Was Lost, Guardian of Unremembered Truth*

## Overview
Archivist Mnemonic exists in a paradoxical stateâ€”he remembers everything that others have forgotten, but cannot remember his own past or identity. Chosen by the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]] to preserve memories that would otherwise be lost forever, he maintains the [[The Archive of Unremembered Things]] where discarded, stolen, or destroyed memories find sanctuary. His existence sustains the balance between remembering and forgetting that keeps the Deep Mother's dreams stable.

## Description
- **Appearance**: Middle-aged man whose features shift slightly when not being directly observed
- **Memory Marks**: Constantly changing tattoos that represent different stored memories
- **Eyes**: Reflect different colors and expressions as various memories surface

- **Presence**: Others often forget his name or face minutes after meeting him

## The Archive of Unremembered Things

## Current Situation
