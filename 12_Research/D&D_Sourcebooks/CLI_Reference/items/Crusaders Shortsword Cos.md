- **Properties**: [[item properties#Finesse|Finesse]], [[item properties#Light|Light]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs. The Crusader's Shortsword is a sentient lawful good [[1-weapon-xdmg (items)]] (Intelligence 11, Wisdom 13, Charisma 13). It has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 120 feet. It communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it. The sword's purpose is to fight evil. The sword has the following additional properties: - The sword continually sheds bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. Only by destroying the sword can this light be extinguished. - A lawful good creature can attune itself to the sword in 1 minute. - While attuned to the weapon, the sword's wielder can use the sword to cast the [[Crusaders Mantle Xphb]] spell. Once used, this property of the sword can't be used again until the next dawn. *Source: Curse of Strahd p. 81* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Crusaders shortsword cos is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
