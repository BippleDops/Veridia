# Pale Tincture
*Adventuring gear, poison (ingested)*  

- **Properties**: [[item properties#Poison|Poison]]
- **Cost**: 250 gp

A creature subjected to Pale Tincture must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (`d6`) Poison damage and have the [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition. The [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] creature repeats the save every 24 hours, taking 3 (`d6`) Poison damage on a failed save. The damage the poison deals can't be healed by any means while the creature remains [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]]. After seven successful saves against the poison, the creature is no longer [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]].
