# Theater
*Level 9 Bastion facility*  

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Space**: Vast (36 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 4
- **Order**: empower

The Theater contains a stage, a backstage area where props and sets are kept, and a seating area for a small audience.

## Empower: Theatrical Event

When you issue the "Empower" order to this facility, its hirelings begin work on a theatrical production or concert. Rehearsals and other preparations take 14 days, followed by at least 7 days of performances. The performances can continue indefinitely until a new production gets underway.

You or another character can contribute to a production in the following ways:

- **Composer/Writer.** A character can compose music or write a script for a concert or production that hasn't started rehearsals yet. This effort takes 14 days.  
- **Conductor/Director.** A character who remains in the Bastion for the entirety of the production can serve as the concert's conductor or the production's director.  
- **Performer.** A character who remains in the Bastion for the entirety of the rehearsal period can be a star performer in one or more of the performances; one of the Theater's hirelings can serve as an understudy for additional performances.  

At the end of a rehearsal period, each character who contributed to the concert or production can make a DC 15 Charisma ([Performance](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Performance)) check. If more of these checks succeed than fail, you and any other character who contributed to the concert or production each gain a Theater die, a `d6`. This die changes to a `d8` when you reach level 13 and a `d10` when you reach level 17. At any point after the rehearsals end, a character can expend their Theater die to roll it and add the number rolled to one [D20 Test](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb.md) they make, immediately after rolling the `d20`. If a character hasn't expended their Theater die before gaining another, their first die is lost.

## Player-Facing Summary

Theater is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of theater as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around theater.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties theater to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at theater to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to theater active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
