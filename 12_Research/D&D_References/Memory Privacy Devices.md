## Lore Details

Legends speak of Memory Privacy Devices as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Memory Privacy Devices.

## Adventure Hooks

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
