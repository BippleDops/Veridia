# Staff of Flowers
*Staff, weapon, common*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/staff-of-flowers.webp#right)

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[item properties#Versatile|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This wooden staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause a flower to sprout from a patch of earth or soil within 5 feet of yourself, or from the staff itself. Unless you choose a specific kind of flower, the staff creates a mild-scented daisy. The flower is harmless and nonmagical, and it grows or withers as a normal flower would.
