# Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/brazier-of-commanding-fire-elementals.webp#right)


While you are within 5 feet of this brazier, you can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action to summon a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/fire-elemental-xmm|Fire Elemental]]. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the brazier as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/initiative-xphb|Initiative]] count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]]. The brazier can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
