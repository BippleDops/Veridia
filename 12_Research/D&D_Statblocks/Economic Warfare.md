## Quest Overview
The [[Goldspire Confederacy]] is orchestrating Aethermoor's economic collapse to force annexation. With [[Zephyr Goldwhisper|02 Worldbuilding/People/Zephyr Goldwhisper]] as their primary agent and multiple crises weakening the kingdom, the party must expose and counter this bloodless invasion while navigating international politics and moral compromises.

## Quest Giver
Multiple possible sources:
- **[[Sir Marcus Dawnforge|02 Worldbuilding/People/Sir Marcus Dawnforge]]** discovers ficial irregularities in Order supplies
- **[[Vex Shadowthorn|02 Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]]** notices foreign interference in black markets
- **[[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde|02 Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]** secretly requests help with mounting debts
- **Anonymous note** revealing Confederate plans (from guilty [[Zephyr Goldwhisper|02 Worldbuilding/People/Zephyr Goldwhisper]])

## Background
The Goldspire Confederacy has been systematically:
- Buying up Aethermoor's debts through shell companies
- Creating artificial supply shortages
- Preparing "humanitarian aid" with sovereignty-surrendering conditions
- Building invasion fleet disguised as relief vessels
- Developing crystal-ification weapons

### Primary Objectives
1. Expose the Confederate economic manipulation
2. Prevent or negotiate the debt crisis
3. Decide [[Zephyr Goldwhisper|02 Worldbuilding/People/Zephyr Goldwhisper]]'s fate
4. Stop or redirect Operation Goldfall

### Zephyr's Dilemma
Zephyr has genuinely grown fond of several Aethermoor citizens and is increasingly conflicted. They possess:
- Complete Confederate invasion plans
-  bomb locations in [[Port Meridian|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]]
- Codes for Confederate spy network
- Personal friendship with Trade Prince

### The Refugee Question
Many Aethermoor refugees in [[Goldspire Port|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Goldspire Port]] support annexation, believing it's better than corruption. They're not wrong - Confederate rule might save lives.

### The Economic Reality
Aethermoor genuinely cannot pay its debts without Confederate help. Default means:
- No foreign trade
- Medical supply shortages
- Famine in urban areas
- Military collapse

## DM Secrets
> [!warning] The Ticking Clock
> - 10 days until debt payment due
> - 7 days until Confederate fleet "training exercise"
> - 5 days until  bombs activate if triggered
> - 3 days until Zephyr must report or be suspected

> [!danger] The Bigger Picture
> The Confederacy isn't entirely evil - they genuinely believe Aethermoor will fall to corruption and want to preserve what they can. Trade Prince Aurelius Gilt lost family to a similar magical catastrophe and sees this as prevention.

> [!info] The Hidden Option
> If the party can prove they're solving the crystal crisis (cure from Green Death quest, Aquabyssos alliance, or Shard unification), the Confederacy might back down and offer genuine partnership instead of takeover.

## Player-Facing Summary

Economic Warfare is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Economic Warfare as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Economic Warfare.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
