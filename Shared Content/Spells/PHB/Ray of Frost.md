# Ray of Frost
A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes `dice: 1d8|avg` (1d8) cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (`dice: 2d8|avg` (2d8)), 11th level (`dice: 3d8|avg` (3d8)), and 17th level (`dice: 4d8|avg` (4d8)).
