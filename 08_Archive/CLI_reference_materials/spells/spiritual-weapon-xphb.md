# Spiritual Weapon
*2nd-level, Evocation*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/spiritual-weapon.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a floating, spectral force that resembles a weapon of your choice and lasts for the duration. The force appears within range in a space of your choice, and you can immediately make one melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of the force. On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal to `d8` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a [Bonus Action](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) on your later turns, you can move the force up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d8` for every slot level above 2.

**Classes**: [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Cleric](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Paladin (Oath of Conquest)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-conquest-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Bard (College of Lore)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Cleric (War Domain)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-war-domain-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
