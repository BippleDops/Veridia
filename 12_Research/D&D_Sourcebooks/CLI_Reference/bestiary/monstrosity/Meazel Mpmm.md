# [[meazel-mpmm|Meazel]]
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 177, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 214*  

Meazels are malicious hermits who fled to the Shadowfell to escape their mortal existence and contemplate their misery. There the shadows transformed them, and their bitterness made them twisted and cruel. Now hate burns in their hearts, and they resent any intrusion into their suffering, waylaying travelers who venture too close to their lairs.

The evil that corrupted meazels also imbued them with magical powers that allow them to move through shadows with ease. They can step from one pool of darkness into another one, using this talent to ambush prey. Sometimes they snatch victims around the throat with their strangling cords and then step away; other times they ferry their victims to isolated spots and then leave the hapless souls to the designs of whatever horrors lurk there.

Any creatures meazels draw through the shadows are cursed by the meazels' baleful magic. The curse acts as a beacon; sorrowsworn (which appear in this book), Undead, and other terrors sense where they are located and descend on the stranded victims to tear them apart.
