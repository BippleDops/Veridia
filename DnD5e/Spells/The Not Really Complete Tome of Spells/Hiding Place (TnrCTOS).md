# Hiding Place (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 hour

**Range**: Special

**Components**: V, M (a scroll covered with pictograms and runes depicting eyes, ears, and brains, which are burned when you cast the spell)

**Duration**: 1 week


## Effects
You spend an hour completely sealing a room of no more than 150 cubic feet: you lock and board all windows and doors, fill all cracks in the walls with rags or putty, and so on. This spell then makes that room com-pletely undetectable to all divination spells of 5th level and lower. In addition, all creatures outside of that room forget about the rooms existence. If you open any of the roomâ€™s doors or windows, the spell fails.
