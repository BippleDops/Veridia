# Conjure Celestial
*7th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You conjure a spirit from the Upper Planes, which manifests as a pillar of light in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [[cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]] centered on a point within range. For each creature you can see in the [[cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]], choose which of these lights shines on it:

- **Healing Light.** The target regains [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] equal to `4d12` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.  
- **Searing Light.** The target makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `6d12` Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.  

Until the spell ends, [[bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]] fills the [[cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]], and when you move on your turn, you can also move the [[cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]] up to 30 feet.

Whenever the [[cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]] moves into the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the [[cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]] or ends its turn there, you can bathe it in one of the lights. A creature can be affected by this spell only once per turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The healing and damage increase by `d12` for each spell slot level above 7.

**Classes**: [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"|Sorcerer (Divine Soul)]]; [[list-spells-classes-cleric|Cleric]]; [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]
