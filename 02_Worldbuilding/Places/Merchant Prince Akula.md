# Merchant Prince Akula

**Type:** Influential NPC/Trade Lord  
**Location:** [[Abyssos Prime]] - The Golden Current Trading House  
**World:** [[Aquabyssos]]  
**Status:** Merchant Prince of the [[Deepwater Trading Consortium]]  
**Race:** Shark-Folk (Sahuagin Noble)  
**Alignment:** Lawful Evil

*"Business is like the ocean - those who understand the currents rise to the surface, while the weak are dragged to the depths."*

## Overview
Merchant Prince Akula is one of the most powerful and feared trade lords in [[Aquabyssos]], commanding vast commercial networks that span the underwater realm. As the head of the [[Golden Current Trading House]] and a senior member of the [[Deepwater Trading Consortium]], his influence extends far beyond mere commerce into the political and social fabric of [[Abyssos Prime]].

Born into the shark-folk nobility, Akula has combined his natural predatory instincts with sharp business acumen to build a commercial empire that rivals the wealth of some surface kingdoms. His operations touch everything from rare deep-sea minerals to exotic creatures, making him both indispensable and dangerous to the realm's economy.

## Physical Description
Akula stands nearly eight feet tall with the imposing physique of his shark-folk heritage. His skin bears the distinctive blue-grey coloration of deep-water predators, marked with ritual scarification that tells the story of his business conquests. His most striking feature is a set of razor-sharp teeth that he displays prominently during negotiations - a reminder of his predatory nature.

His clothing reflects his status, wearing elaborately decorated robes of deep purple and gold, adorned with pearls, crystals, and precious metals acquired through his various trade ventures. Multiple rings bearing the seals of different trading houses and political factions mark his fingers, each representing a different alliance or acquisition.

## Background and Rise to Power

### Early Life
Born to a minor shark-folk clan in the outer territories of [[Aquabyssos]], Akula showed entrepreneurial instincts from an early age. While his peers focused on traditional hunting and warfare, he recognized that the realm's transformation into an underwater civilization created unprecedented opportunities for those willing to adapt.

### First Ventures
Akula's initial success came from organizing the first systematic harvesting operations in the [[Kelp Forest Monasteries]], where he established trade relationships with the reclusive monk communities. By providing them with rare surface goods in exchange for their unique alchemical products, he created a profitable niche that larger trading houses had overlooked.

### Building the Empire
Over two decades, Akula methodically expanded his operations by acquiring smaller trading companies, forming strategic partnerships, and eliminating competition through both legal and questionably legal means. His breakthrough came when he secured exclusive rights to transport goods through the dangerous [[Pressure Tube Terminal]] system, giving him a monopoly on certain high-value trade routes.

### Political Integration
Recognizing that political power was essential for protecting his commercial interests, Akula began cultivating relationships with members of the [[Parliament of Echoes]]. Through a combination of strategic bribes, blackmail, and genuine economic incentives, he secured voting influence that rivals that of elected representatives.

## The Golden Current Trading House

### Headquarters Complex
**Location:** Prime District, [[Abyssos Prime]]  
**Architecture:** Massive coral and crystal structure designed to showcase wealth and intimidate competitors  
**Size:** Seven levels with underwater docking facilities and private submarine bays

**Transportation Services**: Secure shipping for other merchants, including discrete transport for goods that require special handling.

#### Business Philosophy
**Vertical Integration**: Akula controls as much of the supply chain as possible, from extraction to final sale.

## Political Influence and Activities

### Parliament Connections
Akula maintains relationships with at least twelve members of the [[Parliament of Echoes]], providing him with advance warning of policy changes and the ability to influence legislation that affects his business interests. His methods range from straightforward campaign contributions to more subtle forms of coercion.

### Economic Warfare
When legitimate business practices aren't sufficient, Akula employs more aggressive tactics including:
- Price manipulation to drive competitors out of business
- Sabotage of rival shipping operations
- Strategic information leaks that damage competitors' reputations
- Coordinated boycotts of uncooperative suppliers or customers

### International Relations
As one of [[Aquabyssos]]'s most prominent trade leaders, Akula often serves as an unofficial ambassador to foreign powers. His personal relationships with surface world merchants and other underwater civilizations make him valuable to the government, even as his methods raise ethical concerns.

## Current Projects and Schemes

### The Surface Expansion
Akula is quietly developing trade relationships with [[Aethermoor]], seeking to become the primary conduit for commerce between the underwater and surface worlds. This ambitious project requires navigating complex political sensitivities while building the infrastructure for sustained trade.

### The Deep Mine Consortium
He's organizing a coalition of investors to fund mining operations in previously inaccessible areas near [[The Hadal Depths]], despite warnings from the [[Depth Wardens]] about the dangers involved. The potential profits from rare deep minerals justify the risks in his calculations.

### The Memory Trade
Akula has discovered that [[Memory Farmers]] produce artifacts that are highly valued by surface world scholars and mages. He's developing a discrete trade network to export these items, despite legal restrictions on memory-based commerce.

### Political Consolidation
Working to increase his influence within the [[Parliament of Echoes]] by supporting candidates who favor business-friendly policies and opposing those who might regulate his operations more strictly.

Now, as his debts come due, he must find ways to pay prices that go far beyond money - potentially threatening not just his empire, but the safety of all [[Aquabyssos]].
