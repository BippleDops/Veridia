## Preservation

The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a Necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an Undead, you can take a [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules)]] to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.

## Spell Resistance

You have [[Advantage Xphb]] on saving throws against spells.
