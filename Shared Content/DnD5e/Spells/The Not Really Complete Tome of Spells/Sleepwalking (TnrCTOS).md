# Sleepwalking (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (the crushed petal of a blue lotus flower and a drop of honey)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour


## Effects
You target one sleeping creature within range; you do not have to see the creature for this spell to work, but you do need to know that it’s there. You plant a magical suggestion in that creature’s mind (identical to the type made when you cast *suggestion*). Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect; likewise, creatures asleep due to magic cannot be affected. You must word the suggestion in such a manner to make it sound reasonable. The creature may make a Wisdom saving throw to resist. If you or an ally are also using the spell *dream* on the tar-get, the target has disadvantage on the sav-ing throw.
