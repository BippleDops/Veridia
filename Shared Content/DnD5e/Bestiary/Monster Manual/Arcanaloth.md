## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting.*** The arcanaloth's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). The arcanaloth can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: *alter self, darkness, heat metal, invisibility (self only), magic missile*

***Magic Resistance.*** The arcanaloth has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The arcanaloth's weapon attacks are magical.

***Spellcasting.*** The arcanaloth is a 16th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). The arcanaloth has the following wizard spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): *fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation*
1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, identify, shield, Tenser's floating disk*
2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts, mirror image, phantasmal force, suggestion*

## Actions
***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (`dice: 2d4+3`) slashing damage. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (`dice: 3d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Teleport.*** The arcanaloth magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

***Variant: Summon Yugoloth (1/Day).*** The yugoloth attempts a magical summoning.

An arcanaloth has a 40% summoning chance chance of summoning one arcanaloth.

A summoned yugoloth appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, does as it pleases, and can't summon other yugoloths. The summoned yugoloth remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner takes a bonus action to dismiss it.

## Description
Arcanaloths are sly, jackal-headed beings with humanoid bodies, but they can employ magic to take any humanoid form. They do so to gain the trust of creatures with whom they negotiate, replacing jackal snarls with winsome smiles.

Regardless of its chosen form, an arcanaloth appears well groomed, clothing itself in fine robes. Highly intelligent spellcasters who hunger for knowledge and power, arcanaloths command units of lesser yugoloths and maintain the contracts, records, and accounts of their kind.

Arcanaloths speak and write all languages, making them cunning diplomats and negotiators. An arcanaloth properly paid can broker treaties or alliances with subtlety and finesse, just as an arcana loth who changes sides can easily turn the best-laid peace talks into all-out war. What the fiend demands in exchange for its time and talent is information, as well as powerful magic items that it can trade for even more information.
