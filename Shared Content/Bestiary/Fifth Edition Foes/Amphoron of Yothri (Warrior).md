## Special Traits
**Flicker:** Roll `dice: 1d6` for every amphoron in play at the start of its turn. On a roll of 1, the amphoron "flickers" due to a momentary interruption of the connection across time and space. Flickering lasts until the start of the amphoron's next turn. While flickering, the amphoron can't be attacked and can't inflict damage. It regains 2 hit points when it rematerializes. A controller flickers only on a roll of 1 on `dice: 1d20`, but if it does, all amphorons under its control also flicker.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The amphoron attacks once with pincers and once with its flamethrower.

**Melee Attack—Pincers:** +4 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d10 + 2` piercing damage.

**Area Attack—Flamethrower:** automatic hit (range 100 ft. line; all creatures in line). Hit: creatures in the line must make a successful DC 11 Dex saving throw or take `dice: 2d6` fire damage.

**Organization**: Work gang (`dice: 1d4` workers) or crew (`dice: 1d4` – 1 workers, `dice: 1d3` – 1 warriors, and `dice: 1d2` – 1 juggernauts)

## Description
Amphorons of Yothri are mechanisms created by the artificers of that plane using their strange magic-science. Amphorons on the material plane are physical projections of a model that remains on Yothri; the artificer’s mind, possibly using a lens apparatus of some kind, projects the device into the material plane, where it has a physical reality.

These projections can fail momentarily, a phenomenon known as “flickering.” A flickering amphoron is visible as a faint, staticshrouded shape. Moreover, the artificer’s control of more than one amphoron at a time depends on his mental connection to a single, controlling amphoron. If the artificer attempts to switch his mental connection from one amphoron to another, the process takes `dice: 1d6` rounds to complete.

The controlling amphoron has only a 1 in 20 chance of flickering, but if it does so, all of the amphorons under its control also flicker. Any amphoron can serve as the controller, but a single controller can’t control more than six other amphorons, and an artificer can project his mind to only one controller at a time. Thus, unless the artificer has projected some apparatus (the possibilities are many, and left to the Referee’s creativity) to allow remote controllers or auto-controls, the maximum number of amphorons encountered at time is seven (six controlled and one controller). When the artificer’s nefarious schemes on the material plane are complete, he will likely not bother to disintegrate his amphorons, so their material substance remains on the material plane: operating randomly, remaining completely inert, or proceeding independently with their rudimentary intelligence .

An amphorons metallic insides are filled with wires and a gel-l ike flesh that allows the mental connection with the distant reality of Yothri, and also gives the creature its basic intelligence.

Worker amphorons are smaller than humans, and they move on four crablike legs. Warrior amphorons are usually used to protect worker amphorons or in situations where the artificer’s schemes involve violence. The juggernaut amphoron is a harvester/processor the size of a semiattached trailer truck, with a moving crane mounted on its back and two huge circular saws mounted on its articulated arms. Exactly what the [[Artificer of Yothri|artificers of Yothri]] do with the bricks processed through their juggernauts remains a mystery .
