# General Hardware
## Overview
What adventurer is ever sorry to have a bit of rope on hand, or a length of chain? Ropes and chains are, as the old dwarf proverb states, the sinew of civilization. And where good ropes are worth their weight in gold, good locks are worth their weight in platinum: indeed, many such locks guard a thousand times their weight in gems and precious metals. I am pleased, therefore, to offer the finest assortment of ropes, chains, locks, and other supplies of general hardware needed by adventurers and pedestrians of all sorts.
