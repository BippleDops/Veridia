# Room Filling with Water
## Overview
*Mechanical trap*
This stone, 15-foot-cubic room has thick metal doors and four 5-foot-square metal grates in the ceiling. When the door to this room is first opened, characters within 5 feet of the door feel a burst of stagnant, moldy air with a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.

A hidden pressure plate in the floor causes the grates to pour water into the room. Any weight of more than 20 pounds placed on the pressure plate triggers the trap. The pressure plate can be spotted with a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. A character studying the area can determine the pressure plate is a slightly different color than the rest of the floor with a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.

When the trap is triggered, all doors to the room immediately close and lock. The doors are iron (AC 19, 27 hit points) and any character with thieves' tools can pick the lock with a DC 20 Dexterity check. A character without thieves' tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using a hairpin, wire, or other thin, metal tool.

At the start of every round add 3 feet of stagnant, opaque water to the sealed room. Once the water is 6 feet high, creatures without a swim speed who attempt to pick the lock using thieves' tools do so with disadvantage. Creatures in the room without a swim speed must make DC 10 Strength (Athletics) to swim above the rising water once it is equal to or greater than their height. Because the water is opaque, any creature who is submerged in the water is blinded while it remains underwater.

Have the rules for suffocating (Player Basic Rules pg. 65 and Player's Handbook pg. 183) and underwater combat (Player Basic Rules pg. 77 and Player's Handbook pg. 198) handy if you plan to run this trap.

Sometimes the designer of this trap will put a hidden kill switch somewhere within the room in case the trap is triggered by accident. Such a kill switch is usually well hidden beneath a stone in the floor or wall and requires a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to find. Pressing the switch causes the water to stop filling the room and the doors to unlock.
