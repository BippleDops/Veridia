The Resonance Forge Hammer is a legendary crafting artifact of the sky realm, known for its ability to ring with harmonic frequencies that can be heard across floating islands when struck against windwright crystal. Its metal gleams with an inner light that pulses in rhythm with the wielder's heartbeat, and its presence draws crystalline formations to sing in harmony. The hammer anchors ongoing storylines among the craft guilds and offers clear paths to power for those who understand the songs of creation.

When the hammer is active, every windwright in a hundred leagues feels their own tools vibrate in sympathetic response.
