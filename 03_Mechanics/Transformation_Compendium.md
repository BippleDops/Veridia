## Core Transformation Mechanics

### Transformation Points (TP) System

Transformation Points represent the body's capacity to change beyond normal adaptation. Unlike Adaptation Points (AP) which focus on pressure survival, TP encompasses all forms of physical, mental, and spiritual metamorphosis.

**Earning Transformation Points:**

| Source | TP Gained | Trigger | Side Effects |
|--------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Parasite Bond | 2d6 TP | Accepting symbiont | Loss of autonomy |
| Crystal Exposure | 1d8 TP | 24 hours near crystals | Reality distortion |
| Deep Mother's Touch | 3d6 TP | Dream visitation | Prophetic madness |
| Technological Integration | 2d4 TP | Cybernetic implant | Humanity loss |
| Memory Consumption | 1d4 TP | Absorbing 10+ memories | Identity crisis |
| Ritual Transformation | 10 TP | Specific ceremonies | Permanent change |
| Environmental Mutation | 1 TP | Weekly exposure | Gradual shift |
| Traumatic Evolution | 4d6 TP | Near-death experience | Psychological scars |

### Transformation Stages

| Stage | TP Required | Reversibility | Description |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Touched | 1-10 | Easy | Minor cosmetic changes |
| Changed | 11-25 | Moderate | Functional alterations |
| Altered | 26-50 | Difficult | Major physiological shifts |
| Transformed | 51-75 | Near-impossible | Species-level changes |
| Transcendent | 76-100 | Irreversible | Beyond mortal form |
| Apotheosis | 100+ | N/A | Become something else entirely |

### Transformation Resistance

**Base Resistance**: 10 + Constitution modifier + Wisdom modifier

Roll resistance when exposed to transformation triggers:
- **Success**: Halve TP gained (minimum 1)
- **Failure**: Full TP gained
- **Critical Failure**: Double TP gained + immediate minor transformation

## Designer Notes

This system emphasizes:
- **Body horror**: Physical changes are disturbing
- **Loss of humanity**: Mental changes are profound
- **Player agency**: Choices matter in transformation
- **Irreversibility**: Some changes can't be undone
- **Social impact**: Transformation affects relationships
- **Power at a price**: Every benefit has drawbacks

The transformation system should create tension between power and humanity, offering tempting abilities while threatening the character's essential nature. Use it to explore themes of identity, evolution, and what it means to be human in a world where humanity itself is mutable.
