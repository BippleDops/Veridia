![](04_Resources/Assets/Items/item-artifact-flensing-claws-medium-vgm-flensing-claws-medium-vgm.svg) # Flensing Claws (Medium) - **Damage**: `dice: 1d10` slashing Flensing claws take the form of articulated digits that extend into long metal blades. The claws are knitted into the flesh and bones of a creature's arms and can't be removed without surgical amputation. Each set of flensing claws is designed for a specific creature and can't be used by anyone else. A creature equipped with flensing claws can use its action to make one melee weapon attack with the claws. The creature adds its proficiency bonus and Strength modifier to any attack roll made with the claws, and its Strength modifier to its damage roll when it hits a target with the claws. *Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 81* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Flensing claws medium vgm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
