## Vault Optimization - Phase 1

### Summary
This PR implements the first phase of aggressive vault optimization, focusing on reducing repository size, improving structure, and establishing CI/CD guardrails while preserving content fidelity and link integrity.

### Changes

#### 🏗️ Infrastructure & CI
- **GitHub Actions CI** (`.github/workflows/vault-ci.yml`): 
  - Wikilink integrity validation
  - Markdown linting with Obsidian-friendly rules
  - Git LFS enforcement for files >5MB
  - Size budget advisory alerts
- **Development Standards**:
  - `.editorconfig` for consistent formatting
  - `.markdownlint.yaml` with narrative-friendly rules
  - Pre-commit hooks rejecting non-LFS large files

#### 📦 Backups & Storage
- Archived `backups/` to `backups_2025-08-11.tar.gz` (size reduction: ~5MB compressed from original)
- Enabled Git LFS tracking for `04_Resources/Assets/**/*.{png,jpg,jpeg,webp,webm,mp4,svg}`
- Added `.gitignore` entries for future backups

#### 🔧 New Scripts
1. **`scripts/link_integrity_check.py`**: Validates all Obsidian wikilinks
2. **`scripts/media_optimize.py`**: WebP conversion with threshold (≥10% savings)
3. **`scripts/dedupe_assets.py`**: Safe duplicate consolidation with wikilink protection
4. **`scripts/orphan_archiver.py`**: Archives low-value stub orphans to `08_Archive/`

#### 📊 Pre-Optimization Metrics
Generated comprehensive audits in `reports/ops_2025-08-11/`:
- `size_map_pre.json`: Full file/directory size analysis
- `largest_files_pre.tsv`: Top 200 files by size
- `duplicate_assets_pre.tsv`: 4 duplicate groups found
- `orphans_pre.csv`: 5,198 files with 0 inbound links
- `stubs_todos_pre.csv`: 4,737 files with stub/TODO markers

### Planned Optimizations (Ready to Execute)
When the terminal stabilizes, run:
```bash
python3 run_optimizations.py
```

This will:
1. Consolidate duplicate assets (safe mode with wikilink checks)
2. Archive stub-only orphans to `08_Archive/Pruned_2025-08/`
3. Optimize top 50 images to WebP (with ≥10% savings threshold)
4. Generate link integrity report
5. Commit and push all changes

### Expected Impact
- **Size Reduction**: ~25-40% for media assets
- **Duplicate Removal**: 4 groups consolidated
- **Orphan Archival**: ~500-1000 low-value stubs moved
- **Link Integrity**: 0 broken wikilinks post-optimization

### Safety & Rollback
- Git tag created: `opt-snapshot-2025-08-11`
- Backups archived: `backups_2025-08-11.tar.gz`
- **One-command rollback**: 
  ```bash
  git revert $(git log --oneline -n 5 | tail -1 | cut -d' ' -f1)^..HEAD
  ```
- All operations are idempotent and reversible

### Testing
- [ ] CI passes all checks
- [ ] Link integrity report shows 0 broken links
- [ ] Obsidian vault opens without errors
- [ ] Media displays correctly
- [ ] Archived content has redirect stubs

### Documentation
- `README_Optimization.md`: Pipeline documentation
- Reports in `reports/ops_2025-08-11/`
- Scripts are self-documenting with `--help`

### Next Steps (Phase 2)
- Semantic search and "Related Pages" generation
- Frontmatter schema hardening
- Tag taxonomy enforcement
- Knowledge graph builder
- Timeline continuity engine

**Note**: The terminal tool experienced issues during execution. The optimization scripts are ready but need to be run manually once the system recovers.
