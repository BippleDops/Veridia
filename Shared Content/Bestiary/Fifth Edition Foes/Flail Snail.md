## Special Traits
**Mucus:** As a flail snail moves, it can leave a trail of mucus along the ground that it travels across. It has two types of mucus: slimy and sticky. Slimy mucus has the effect of a grease spell (affected ground is difficult terrain; creatures that enter affected ground must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity \[Acrobatics] check or fall prone). Sticky mucus has the effect of a web spell (creatures entering the affected ground must make a successful DC 12 Strength \[Athletics] check or become restrained; the check can be repeated as an action, with success indicating the trapped creature broke free). Both types last for 10 minutes, then dry out and are no longer effective. Flail snails are immune to this mucus.

**Retraction:** Instead of moving, a flail snail can pull its fleshy parts back into its shell, increasing its armor class to 22, but it can't move or take actions while retracted. Extending itself again also takes the place of any other movement that turn.

**Slime Rope:** A flail snail can turn its mucus into a ropelike strand up to 60 ft. long. If this strand is anchored to a wall or ceiling, the flail snail and up to another 1,000 pounds can hang from it indefinitely. The flail snail can climb up this strand 10 feet per round, or lower itself down it 20 feet per round. Other creatures can climb the strand with a successful DC 20 Str (Athletics) check. Once the snail breaks contact with the strand, the slime dries out and decomposes in `dice: 1d4` rounds, after which it can't be used by anyone.

**Suction:** A snail's foot adheres to surfaces so well that its 10-foot climb speed applies even on perfectly sheer surfaces and ceilings, with no chance to fall off unless the foot is actively peeled loose by external force.

**Warp Magic:** Any spell that targets a flail snail directly has an 80% chance of producing a random effect instead of the desired affect. Only spells that directly target the flail snail are warped; area effect spells are not affected. When a spell is cast, roll percentile dice and consult the table.


| **`dice: d100`** | **Result** |
|---|---|
| 1-25 | Spell misfires. For the next `dice: 1d4` rounds, the caster must make a successful DC 12 concentration check each time he or she tries to cast a spell or the spell can’t be cast this turn and the action is wasted. |
| 26-50 | Spell misfires. The creature nearest the flail snail is affected instead, as if the spell had targeted it. |
| 51-70 | Spell fails. The spell slot is used but nothing happens. |
| 71-80 | Spell rebounds and targets the caster with its full effect. |
| 81-100 | Spell behaves and takes effect as intended. |

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A flail snail attacks four times with tentacle clubs.

**Tentacle Club:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d8+3`) bludgeoning damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Underground or ruins

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, or rout (3–30)

## Description
Flail snails are solitary omnivores that live in the deepest recesses of caverns, caves, and dungeons, or occasionally aboveground in the ruins of ancient, abandoned cities. They sustain themselves on a diet of fungus, mold, and rodents. Although one would hardly suspect it on seeing a flail snail, they are intelligent creatures. They have no sound-producing organs, so their language is built around patterns created with their multipurpose mucus. Like most creatures, they are inoffensive when left alone, but they are tremendously paranoid about strangers; when someone intrudes into their normally abandoned territory, flail snails are prone to attack first and think up questions later.

They do not collect treasure, but the multi-hued shell of a flail snail can be sold to craftsmen, carvers, and collectors of strange and exotic curios for 80–120 gp, or possibly more for a particularly large or fine specimen. Shell hunters may be the reason why flail snails are paranoid in the first place.

## Greater Flail Snail
A typical adult flail snail has 4 hit dice, but there is tremendous variety among their population. In fact, flail snails can be found with 1 to 12 hit dice, and they have one clublike tentacle per hit die. Thus, a 6 HD flail snail has six tentacles; an 8 HD flail snail has eight tentacles; a 12 HD flail snail has twelve tentacles; and so on. A flail snail can attack with all of its tentacles. Flail snails have 7.5 hit points per hit die, and the creature’s CR increases by 1 for every two additional tentacles beyond the basic four. All other statistics remain the same.
