## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The anarch's innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

At Will: *mage hand (the hand is invisible)*
3/day each: *feather fall, jump, see invisibility, shield, telekinesis*
1/day each: *globe of invulnerability, plane shift, teleportation circle, wall of force*

***Psychic Defense.*** While the anarch is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The anarch makes three unarmed strikes.

***Unarmed Strike.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 ( `dice: 2d8+5`) bludgeoning damage plus 18 ( `dice: 4d8`) psychic damage.

## Legendary Actions
The Githzerai Anarch can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Githzerai Anarchregains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Strike.** The anarch makes one unarmed strike.

**Teleport.** The anarch magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing and carrying, to an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it.

**Change Gravity (Costs 3 Actions).** The anarch casts the reverse gravity spell. The spell has the normal effect, except that the anarch can orient the area in any direction and creatures and objects fall toward the end of the area.

## Description
The most powerful of the githzerai, anarchs lead communities and maintain the adamantine citadels that serve as strong points in planes beyond Limbo. They have formidable psionic capabilities, able to manipulate the unformed substance of their adopted plane with a thought. These rare githzerai are sages and mystics, and their word is law.

### An Anarch's Lair
The most powerful of the githzerai, anarchs lead communities and maintain the adamantine citadels that serve as strong points in planes beyond Limbo. They have formidable psionic capabilities, able to manipulate the unformed substance of their adopted plane with a thought. These rare githzerai are sages and mystics, and their word is law.

#### Lair Actions
An anarch can use lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the anarch can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the anarch can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- The anarch casts the lightning bolt spell (at 5th level), but the anarch can change the damage type from lightning to cold, fire, psychic, radiant, or thunder. If the spell deals damage other than fire or lightning, it doesn't ignite flammable objects.
- The anarch casts the creation spell (as a 9th-level spell) using the unformed substance of Limbo instead of shadow material. If used in Limbo, the object remains until the anarch's concentration is broken, regardless of its composition. If the anarch moves more than 120 feet from the object, its concentration breaks.
- The anarch can magically move an object it can see within 150 feet of it by making a Wisdom check with advantage. The DC depends on the object's size: DC 5 for Tiny, DC 10 for Small, DC 15 for Medium, DC 20 for Large, and DC 25 for Huge or larger.

#### Regional Effects
The region containing an anarch's lair is warped by its presence, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- In Limbo, the anarch can spend 10 minutes stabilizing a 5-mile area centered on it, causing the unformed substance to take whatever inanimate form the anarch chooses. During that process, the anarch determines the shape and composition of the forms created.
- The anarch stabilizes any object created in Limbo and brought to the Material Plane for as long as the anarch remains within 1 mile of it (no action required).

If the anarch dies, these effects end after `dice: 1d6` rounds. All formed substance becomes a chaotic churn of energy and matter, unraveling into unformed substance that dissipates `dice: 1d6` rounds later.
