> The thermal vents that power the Temple Ward are actually maintained by an ancient agreement with a powerful water elemental lord who dwells deep beneath the city. This being, known as [[The Deepmost Current, requires regular offerings and ceremonies to maintain the sacred waters' power. Only the highest-ranking clergy know of this arrangement, and they carefully maintain the traditions that keep the elemental satisfied. If the agreement were broken, the Ward would lose its healing properties and much of its spiritual power, potentially triggering religious crisis throughout the kingdom. --- **Related Locations**: - [Port Meridian]] - [[Noble Quarter - [Harbor District]] - [[Royal Palace **Related NPCs**: - [High Hierophant Meridius]] - [[High Priestess Nerida Soulcurrent - [Council of Faiths]] - [[Temple Clergy **Related Items and Concepts**: - [Sacred Healing Springs]] - [[Interfaith Cooperation - [Religious Festivals]] - [[Divine Magic]] ## Player-Facing Summary Temple Ward is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
