| dice: d12 | What Happened |
|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | You were turned into a toad and remained in that form for `d4` weeks. |
| 2 | You were [[conditions#Petrified|petrified]] and remained a stone statue for a time until someone freed you. |
| 3 | You were enslaved by a hag, a satyr, or some other being and lived in that creature's thrall for `d6` years. |
| 4 | A dragon held you as a prisoner for `d4` months until adventurers killed it. |
| 5 | You were taken captive by a race of evil humanoids such as drow, kuo-toa, or quaggoths. You lived as a slave in the Underdark until you escaped. |
| 6 | You served a powerful adventurer as a hireling. You have only recently left that service. Use the supplemental tables and work with your DM to determine the basic details about your former employer. |
| 7 | You went insane for `d6` years and recently regained your sanity. A tic or some other bit of odd behavior might linger. |
| 8 | A lover of yours was secretly a silver dragon. |
| 9 | You were captured by a cult and nearly sacrificed on an altar to the foul being the cultists served. You escaped, but you fear they will find you. |
| 10 | You met a demigod, an archdevil, an archfey, a demon lord, or a titan, and you lived to tell the tale. |
| 11 | You were swallowed by a giant fish and spent a month in its gullet before you escaped. |
| 12 | A powerful being granted you a wish, but you squandered it on something frivolous. |
