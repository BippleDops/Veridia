--- ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Core Concept

Prices, availability, and demand shift session-to-session based on events, faction control, and Convergence weather. Use lightweight clocks and modifiers to keep it fast at the table. ## Market State Clock (0–6)

- 0–1: Stable. Prices -10% on staples, +10% on rarities.
- 2–3: Tense. Prices normal; rumor trades common.
- 4–5: Volatile. Prices +10% across the board; black market adds `dice: 1d4` items.
- 6: Crisis. Prices +25%; legal supply constricts; smuggling checks at advantage. Advance one tick when: major route disrupted, scandal revealed, shard power spikes, war escalates. Reduce one tick when: truce holds a week, cure stabilizes, guardian pact honored. ## At the Table: Quick Procedure

1) Set or adjust Market State.
2) Roll availability for 3 slots.
3) Apply faction control mods.
4) Offer one rumor tied to a route or shard event. ## Player-Facing Summary Living Economy Syste is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Living Economy Syste as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Living Economy Syste. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is hunting a artifact for revenge
