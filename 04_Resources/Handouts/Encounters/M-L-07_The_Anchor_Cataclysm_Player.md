# The Anchor Cataclysm

One by one, the world’s steadying songs fall silent.

What you notice
- A hush that feels wrong
- Maps that don’t match the sea

What you can try
- Keep one song alive
- Choose what to save

Possible outcomes
- A world held together by your hands
- A loss you can count
- A new map
