## Description
Among the most ancient, simple, and useful of farming devices, scythes allow harvesters to reap a 6-foot circle about themselves with one swipe. We offer scythes with a 3-foot steel blade and a 10-foot duskwood handle (8 gp) as well as selling the blades (5 gp) and the handle (4 gp) separately. Though scythes have received much bad gossip lately in regard to “grim reaper” legends, they still rank among the most useful and indispensable tools.
