# Wing Gifting (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 hour


## Effects
One willing creature you touch gains a pair of wings. The creature’s flying speed is double your walking speed, and the creature gains one additional ability, depending on the type of wing:

♦ ***Butterfly Wings.*** These wings grant the bearer the ability to flutter—the bearer moves in an erratic fashion. While in the air, any creature targeting the bearer with a melee or missile weapon attack are at disadvantage to do so.

♦ ***Dragon Wings.*** These wings grant the bearer a wing buffet attack, which can be used as a bonus action. This attack has a reach of 10 feet and inflicts 1d4 + the bearer’s Strength modifier, and that creature must make a Strength saving throw, with a DC equal to 8 + the bearer’s Strength modifier, or fall prone.

♦ ***Dragonfly Wings.*** These wings grant the bearer the ability to hover.

♦ ***Eagle Wings.*** These wings grant the bearer the ability to make a dive attack. If that creature dives at least 30 feet straight towards a target and then hit it with a melee weapon attack, the attack deals an additional 1d10 damage to the target.
