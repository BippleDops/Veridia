## Description
A popular diversion originating in Ordulin, but becoming increasingly popular as far away as Waterdeep, these foot-high wooden dolls are made of joined finished pieces hinged and mounted on long wands. By manipulating the wands, the doll can be made to move and fight its opponent. A careful blow knocks the opponent’s head off, or caves in its thin [[Metal|metal]] shield. Crafted of fine Sembian woods and hand-painted, these fighting dolls can provide many evenings of amusement, and Ordulin is famous for its “battle-masters” who have raised this novel toy to an art form. A set of two fighting dolls can be yours for the modest investment of 7 gp. Not recommended for children under 12 due to the sharp points on the swords.

## Additional Details
Important Note: An earlier order of clockwork fighting dolls has been canceled, and no further orders will be taken. These dolls, from Lantan, staged their own mutiny in Baldur’s Gate, and escaped into the city at large. I deeply regret the inconvenience caused by these defective [[Toys|toys]], and have lent all my available resources to capturing and destroying them. To that end, no further fighting dolls from Lantan are imported (though other clockwork dolls are available, and have been heavily screened to ascertain their harmlessness).
