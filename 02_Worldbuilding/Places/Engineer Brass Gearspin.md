### The Impossible Commission
**Level**: 6-10
A mysterious patron commissions the Brass Works to build a device that seems to violate the known laws of physics. As work progresses, it becomes clear the device has connections to otherworldly forces, and completing it may have dangerous consequences for Aquabyssos.

### The Stolen Innovation
**Level**: 3-6
Gearspin's latest breakthrough has been stolen by industrial spies, and copies are appearing in workshops throughout the city. The party must track down the thieves and prevent the spread of potentially dangerous technology before it destabilizes the city's mechanical infrastructure.

### The Mechanical Plague
**Level**: 7-11
Devices throughout Aquabyssos begin developing a strange form of mechanical consciousness, behaving erratically and sometimes aggressively. The phenomenon seems to originate from the Brass Works, but determining whether this is sabotage, accident, or evolution requires deep investigation.

### The Deep Commission
**Level**: 8-12
The city government secretly commissions the Brass Works to build mechanical devices for exploring the deepest, most dangerous parts of the ocean floor. The project requires rare materials and dangerous testing, but success could provide crucial intelligence about threats to the city.

### The Apprentice Rebellion
**Level**: 2-5
A group of apprentices has been secretly working on unauthorized projects using workshop resources. Their activities threaten to expose sensitive research or create dangerous devices, and the party must resolve the situation without destroying promising young careers.

### The Temporal Engine
**Level**: 10-15
Gearspin's research into temporal mechanics has produced a prototype device that can affect the flow of time around mechanical systems. However, the device's testing has attracted attention from temporal entities, and stabilizing the technology requires navigating complex time-related challenges.

## Secrets and Hidden Elements

### The Underground Laboratory
Beneath the main workshop lies Gearspin's secret research facility, where he works on projects too dangerous or revolutionary for the main workshop. Access requires solving complex mechanical puzzles that change regularly.

### The Shard-Powered Engine
One of Gearspin's most closely guarded secrets is his successful integration of Shard energy into mechanical systems. This breakthrough could revolutionize engineering throughout Aquabyssos, but also makes the workshop a target for those seeking the Shards.
