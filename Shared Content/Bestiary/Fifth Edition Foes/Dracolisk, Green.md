## Special Traits
**Breath Weapon:** A dracolisk can use its breath weapon as an attack. Its breath characteristics are determined by its draconic background, as summarized on the table. Regardless of the type of breath weapon involved, targets in the area of effect take half damage with a successful DC 16 Dex saving throw. Lines are 5 feet wide.

**Immunity to Energy:** Each type of dracolisk is immune to the energy type inherent in its own breath weapon, as summarized on the table.

**Petrifying Gaze:** As an attack, a dracolisk can target one living creature within 30 feet and line of sight with its petrifying gaze. If the targeted creature can see the dracolisk, then the targeted creature must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or begin turning to stone; it immediately becomes restrained, and it must make another DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of its next turn. Success on the second saving throw ends this effect. Failure on the second saving throw means the creature is petrified permanently. A creature that is capable of taking actions can, at the start of its turn, look away to avoid the dracolisk's gaze for one complete round. If it targets the dracolisk while averting its gaze, it suffers all the usual penalties for attacking an unseen target. Creatures that are blind, unconscious, or unable to see the dracolisk for any other reason are immune to this attack.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A dracolisk bites once and attacks once with claws, or it uses its breath weapon or its petrifying gaze.

**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (`dice: 2d8+5`) piercing damage.

**Claws:** *Melee Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 18 (`dice: 3d8+5`) slashing damage.

**Breath Weapon (Recharge 5—6):** Area Attack: automatic hit, range 30 ft. cone, creatures in range. Hit: 18 (`dice: 4d8`) acid damage, or half damage with a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. See Breath Weapon, above, for variables.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Varies

**Organization**: Solitary or colony (3–6)

## Description
The vicious dracolisk is a rare crossbreed of dragon and basilisk. No one is sure how the dracolisk species came to be, but all who have encountered it are well aware of its lethality. The only confirmed species of dracolisk is clearly the offspring of black dragons, but based on that evidence, sages hypothesize that a species of dracolisk could exist corresponding to every species of dragon.

At first glance, a dracolisk appears to be a juvenile dragon of its color, except the dracolisk has six legs instead of four. Thanks to the petrifying gaze it inherited from its basilisk parent, most characters who encounter a dracolisk never get a second glance. A dracolisk has a scaled body the same color as its dragon parent that fades to a lighter shade on its underside. A short, curved horn, similar to a rhino’s, juts from its nose. Its leathery wings match its body color but darken near the tips. All dracolisk’s eyes are pale green with sparkles that match its dragon-parent color.

A dracolisk’s environment varies based on its dragon heritage: [[Dracolisk, Black|black dracolisks]] can be found in warm marshes, deserts, or underground; [[Dracolisk, Blue|blue dracolisks]] favor warm deserts and mountains, rarely being found underground; green dracolisks favor temperate or warm forests and underground settings; [[Dracolisk, Red|red dracolisks]] favor warm mountains and underground settings; and [[Dracolisk, White|white dracolisks]] favor cold mountains, cold deserts, and underground.

The dracolisk always opens a fight with its breath weapon and gaze attack, resorting to its claws and teeth only afterward.
