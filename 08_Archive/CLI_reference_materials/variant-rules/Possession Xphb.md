# Possession
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 372. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

Some effects cause a creature to be possessed by another creature or entity. A possessing effect defines how the possession operates. Possession can be prevented by the [Protection from Evil and Good](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good-xphb.md) spell and ended by the [Dispel Evil and Good](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-evil-and-good-xphb.md) spell.
