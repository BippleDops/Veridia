*Several varieties of gargoyles exist, and each is detailed below. For all their differences, gargoyles also share some common traits. They can remain utterly motionless for days, weeks, or even years, and they are indistinguishable from stone for as long as they remain still. Regardless of how long they’ve been inert, they can spring into sudden, savage action in an instant.*

*This creature appears to be a hideous and winged humanoid carved of stone. Its ears are oversized and pointed, and two large, backward-curving horns jut from its head above its eyes. It has four arms, and each ends in stony claws.*

## Special Traits
**Sickening Aura:** A fungus gargoyle stinks like rotting vegetable matter. Creatures that begin their turn within 10 feet of a fungus gargoyle must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for as long as they remain within 10 feet of any fungus gargoyle and for `dice: 1d4` rounds afterward.

**Spore Poisoning:** A creature affected by spore poisoning must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of every hour. On a successful saving throw, there is no effect; on a failed saving throw, the creature adds one level of exhaustion to its current exhaustion level. A creature can't recover from exhaustion while suffering from spore poisoning. The character recovers from exhaustion by normal means once the poison is neutralized with magic.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A fungus gargoyle attacks twice with claws or once with spore breath.

**Claw:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d10+2`) slashing damage.

**Spore Breath (Recharge 5—6):** Area Attack: automatic hit, range 10 ft. line, creatures in line. Hit: affected creatures must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion and suffer spore poisoning (see above).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any non-arctic land

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, or patch (5–10)

## Description
Fungus gargoyles are thought to have once been normal gargoyles that were transformed into a [[Fungoid|fungoid]] state by an evil cult that pays reverence to demons of slime, ooze, and fungus. There is a link, in that these creatures are often found acting as guardians in temples dedicated to such demons.

Fungus gargoyles do not require food or air, though they still require water. They sometimes consume fallen enemies for the sheer pleasure of doing so.

A typical fungus gargoyle stands 5 to 6 feet tall (depending on how much it stoops) and weighs up to 200 pounds. Though their shape can vary, most resemble ugly, winged humanoids with diabolical features.

Fungus gargoyles behave much like normal gargoyles. They can stand motionless for seemingly endless lengths of time until they spring into action to ambush nearby prey. Unlike stony gargoyles, motionless fungus gargoyles are relatively easy to injure by cutting or stabbing, though this usually triggers an immediate response of claws to the face of the attacker. Once battle is joined, fungus gargoyles prefer to take flight and fight on the wing rather than on their feet.
