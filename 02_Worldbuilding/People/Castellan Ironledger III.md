Castellan serves as the ultimate information broker and can provide plot hooks, crucial intelligence, or economic support to the party. His neutrality makes him useful for facilitating meetings between hostile factions. However, his knowledge makes him dangerous—he could become either an invaluable ally or a deadly enemy depending on how the party treats him. His connections to every major player allow him to naturally weave different plot threads together.
