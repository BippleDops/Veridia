# Rope of Entanglement
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/rope-of-entanglement.webp#right)


This rope is 30 feet long. While holding one end of the rope, you can take a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to command the other end to dart forward and entangle one creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have the [Restrained](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Restrained) condition. You can release the target by letting go of your end of the rope (causing the rope to coil up in the target's space) or by using a [Bonus Action](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) to repeat the command (causing the rope to coil up in your hand).

A target [Restrained](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Restrained) by the rope can take an action to make its choice of a DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Athletics)) or Dexterity ([Acrobatics](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Acrobatics)) check. On a successful check, the target is no longer [Restrained](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Restrained) by the rope. If you're still holding onto the rope when a target escapes from it, you can take a [Reaction](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to command the rope to coil up in your hand; otherwise, the rope coils up in the target's space.

The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and [Immunity](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 [Hit Point](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 [Hit Point](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). If the rope drops to 0 [Hit Points](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md), it is destroyed.
