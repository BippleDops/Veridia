# Otiluke's Fire and Ice (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *8th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 300 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of phospho-rous and a small quartz crystal)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
Two bright streaks of energy, one red and one blue, flash from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range. The red streak explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point; a split-second later, the blue streak explodes. Each creature within that radius must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 fire damage and 6d6 cold damage, and then 3d6 bludgeoning damage due to the resultant shock wave on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the fire and cold damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 7th.
