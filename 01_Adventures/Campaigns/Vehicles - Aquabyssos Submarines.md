1 Pressure surge • 2 Kelp snare • 3 Cavitation bloom • 4 Shadow bloom • 5 Merger flicker • 6 Leviathan passing • 7 Parasite cloud • 8 Memory storm • 9 Thermal vent • 10 Hull hymn (ship hums prophecy) See also: [Vessel_Horror_Intensifier|Vessel Horror Intensifier]], [[Journey_Event_Compiler|Journey Event Compiler, [Transportation_Infrastructure]]. ## Player-Facing Summary Aquabyssos Submarines is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Aquabyssos Submarines as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Aquabyssos Submarines. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A merchant needs help stealing before the new moon
