## Description
Tunnel prawns are scavengers resembling very large lobsters. These creatures wander through subterranean caverns eating bugs and fungi from the wall, floor, and ceiling. A tunnel prawn can scale walls and move along ceilings with no more difficulty than walking along a floor.

These dungeon vermin consider everything food, and they are easily antagonized. They attack almost any creature they encounter, alive or dead, regardless of its size.

Tunnel prawns are edible, and each one is large enough to provide a day’s rations for a Small or Medium humanoid. The meat is tough and chewy, but tasty (somewhat surprisingly, considering their diet). It becomes inedible after 24 hours, however. Some taverns—usually those located near well-known dungeon entrances—serve tunnel prawns, and will pay up to 3 gp apiece for fresh ones. An adult tunnel prawn weighs up to 20 lbs.
