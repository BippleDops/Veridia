Oxen are domesticated cattle bred for milk and meat production and for hauling. Many cultures incorporate the ox into their labor and diets.

## Cattle

Many kinds of cattle roam the multiverse, some of them domesticated and others feral. In many cultures, cattle are almost like family to the folk who tend to them.
