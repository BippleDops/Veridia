# Liminal Constantinople

## Overview
The drowned capital of Aquabyssos, where the Byzantine Empire's greatest city was pulled beneath the waves during the First Drowning. Now it exists in a constant state of transformation—buildings flow between solid and liquid, air pockets appear and vanish, and the city reshapes itself according to the collective unconscious of its inhabitants. Home to 500,000 transformed souls and seat of the Drowned Parliament.

## DM Notes
Liminal Constantinople is the heart of Aquabyssos—a city that exemplifies the alien logic of the drowned world. Nothing here works as surface dwellers expect. The city's fluid nature allows for surreal encounters and reality-bending scenarios. The Parliament provides political intrigue while the various districts offer different adventure types. The city's connection to both the surface and the deepest depths makes it a perfect hub for Aquabyssos campaigns. Remember that the city literally reshapes itself based on the collective unconscious, so the party's fears and desires might manifest physically.
