# Cloud of Putrefaction (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
You create a billowy cloud colored like an old bruise that fills a 20-foot cube anywhere within range. This cloud moves with the prevailing wind and a magical wind quickly disperses it. The cloud is heavier than air and will sink to the ground rather than float away. The cloud lasts for one minute before vanishing, but the effects are permanent.

The cloud transmutes pure water into filth, excrement, and garbage, and magically generates flies, and turns small animals into rats and roaches.
