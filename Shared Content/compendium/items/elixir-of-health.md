# Elixir of Health
*Potion, minor, rare*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

When you drink this potion, it cures any disease afflicting you, and it removes the [blinded](/rules/conditions.md#blinded), [deafened](/rules/conditions.md#deafened), [paralyzed](/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed), and [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned) conditions. The clear red liquid has tiny bubbles of light in it.
