# The Drowned Temple
*Ancient Sacred Site of Submerged Faith*

> *"In the deepest currents where light fears to tread, where the weight of water becomes the weight of eternity, there stands the Drowned Temple - a monument to faith that death itself cannot diminish, tended by those who found holiness in their own drowning."*
> â€” [[Sacred Historian Coral Deepscribe]], *Lost Sanctuaries of Aquabyssos*

## Overview

The Drowned Temple represents one of [[Aquabyssos]]'s most mysterious and spiritually powerful religious sites, an ancient sanctuary that predates the current underwater civilization by centuries. Built originally as a surface temple to oceanic deities, it was claimed by rising waters during the Great Submersion, transforming from a place of worship into something far more profound - a shrine to the sacred nature of drowning itself. Under the eternal guardianship of Marcus the Drowned, an undying priest whose faith transcended death, the temple has become a pilgrimage destination for those seeking to understand the mystical relationship between water, death, and divine transcendence.

## Atmospheric Description

### The Sunken Sanctuary
**Ancient Majesty**: The temple emerges from the seafloor like a coral-encrusted cathedral, its original stone architecture now fused with centuries of marine growth. Massive pillars rise through dancing kelp forests, their surfaces carved with prayers in languages that predate current Aquabyssos script. Bioluminescent organisms have colonized the religious artwork, creating slowly pulsing mandalas of light that seem to breathe with divine presence.

**Sacred Waters**: The temple's central chamber contains the Pool of Sacred Drowning, where pilgrims undergo ritual submersion to experience symbolic death and rebirth. The water within glows with soft blue-green light, enriched with blessed minerals and tended by sacred fish that are said to carry the souls of the faithful to their final rest.

### The Guardian's Vigil
**Eternal Watch**: At the temple's heart stands Marcus the Drowned, preserved by divine will in the exact moment of his holy drowning centuries ago. Neither fully alive nor completely dead, he maintains eternal vigil over the sacred site, his waterlogged form moving through rituals with the precision of centuries-long practice.

**Living Death**: The temple atmosphere reflects Marcus's unique state - neither the warmth of life nor the cold of death, but something transcendent that exists between realms. Visitors often report feeling the presence of countless souls who have found peace through sacred drowning.

## Notable Features and Landmarks

### The Pool of Sacred Drowning
**Ritual Center**: The temple's most sacred feature is the central pool where the drowning rituals are performed under Marcus's guidance. The pool's waters are said to show visions of the afterlife to those who submerge themselves with proper faith and preparation.

**Divine Properties**: The pool maintains perfect temperature and purity through unknown means, with waters that seem to respond to the spiritual state of those who enter. Some pilgrims report seeing visions of deceased loved ones in its depths.

### The Memorial Walls
**Honored Dead**: The walls surrounding the temple are carved with the names and stories of all who have undergone sacred drowning here, creating an ever-growing record of souls who found divine peace through ritual death and rebirth.

**Living History**: New names appear on the walls through supernatural means after successful drowning rituals, suggesting divine intervention in maintaining the records.

### The Kelp Garden Cloister
**Meditation Space**: Surrounding the main temple, cultivated kelp gardens provide spaces for quiet contemplation and prayer. The swaying fronds create natural chambers where pilgrims can reflect on mortality and transcendence.

**Sacred Cultivation**: The kelp grows in patterns that spell out religious texts and prayers, maintained through a combination of careful tending and divine influence.

### The Confession Grottos
**Spiritual Cleansing**: Natural caves around the temple have been converted into confession spaces where pilgrims share their deepest sins and fears with the sacred waters themselves, believing that the ocean will carry their burdens to divine forgiveness.

**Therapeutic Waters**: Each grotto contains healing springs that provide both physical restoration and spiritual cleansing for those who confess honestly.

### The Ossuary of Souls
**Sacred Repository**: Beneath the main temple lies a vast chamber containing the remains of all who have achieved sacred drowning. Their bones are arranged in intricate patterns that form prayers and sacred geometries.

**Spiritual Energy**: The ossuary serves as a focus for the temple's divine power, amplifying prayers and enabling communication with the spirits of the dead.

## NPCs That Can Be Found Here

## Plot Hooks and Adventures

### The Lost Pilgrimage
**Level**: 6-12

The characters must investigate what happened while respecting the temple's sacred nature and navigating the complex spiritual politics surrounding the disappearances.

### The Sacred Relic Quest
**Level**: 8-14  
**Mission**: Ancient texts speak of a divine artifact hidden within the temple that could purify the corruption spreading through [[Aquabyssos]]'s waters. The characters must prove their worthiness to Marcus and undergo spiritual trials to locate the relic, facing both physical dangers and spiritual challenges that test their faith and resolve.

### The False Guardian
**Level**: 7-13  
**Deception**: Someone claiming to be another drowned guardian has appeared, challenging Marcus's authority and performing competing rituals that may be corrupting the temple's sacred nature. The characters must determine which guardian is authentic while avoiding spiritual contamination from false teachings.

### The Resurrection Crisis
**Level**: 9-15  
**Emergency**: The temple's spiritual balance has been disrupted, causing the dead to rise improperly and threaten both the temple and surrounding areas. The characters must work with Marcus to restore proper order while protecting pilgrims and investigating the source of the disruption.

## Secrets and Lore

### The Original Drowning
**Historical Truth**: Marcus was the temple's last surface priest when the Great Submersion occurred. Rather than flee, he chose to remain and undergo sacred drowning to maintain the temple's sanctity, achieving a state between life and death through divine intervention and his own unshakeable faith.

### The Soul Network
**Hidden Connection**: The temple is connected to a network of similar drowned sites throughout the ocean, allowing communication between guardians and the transportation of souls seeking final rest. This network serves as a spiritual infrastructure for the entire underwater realm.

### The Divine Experiment
**Cosmic Purpose**: Some scholars believe the temple serves as a testing ground for divine power, experimenting with the boundaries between life and death to prepare for greater cosmic challenges that threaten both mortal and divine realms.

### The Preserved Archives
**Lost Knowledge**: Hidden within the temple are records from before the Great Submersion, containing knowledge of surface civilizations and religious practices that could revolutionize understanding of pre-drowning history.

## Environmental Hazards

### Sacred Drowning Risk
**Spiritual Danger**: The temple's spiritual energy can trigger involuntary drowning experiences in unprepared visitors, potentially causing actual death rather than symbolic transformation. Characters must make Wisdom saving throws (DC 15) when entering sacred areas or risk being overcome by drowning visions.

### Divine Pressure
**Overwhelming Holiness**: The concentration of sacred energy can overwhelm visitors, causing religious ecstasy, temporary madness, or permanent spiritual transformation. Extended exposure requires Constitution saves to avoid being permanently changed by divine influence.

### Ghostly Interference
**Restless Spirits**: Souls who died improperly in the temple may manifest as dangerous undead, requiring careful spiritual management to resolve. These spirits can possess visitors or drain life energy from those who lack proper spiritual protection.

### Tidal Resonance
**Spiritual Turbulence**: During certain tidal conditions, the temple's spiritual energies become unstable, causing unpredictable effects including time distortions, prophetic visions, or temporary access to other planes of existence.

## Treasures and Rewards

### Sacred Drowning Blessing
**Divine Gift**: Characters who successfully undergo the sacred drowning ritual gain permanent resistance to drowning and the ability to breathe underwater, along with spiritual insights that enhance Wisdom scores and provide immunity to fear effects related to death.

### Priestly Training
**Religious Knowledge**: Study with Marcus can provide proficiency in Religion skill and access to unique clerical spells related to water, death, and transformation. Advanced training may grant access to divine magic typically restricted to high-level clerics.

### Holy Relics

### Spiritual Guidance
**Divine Wisdom**: Regular consultation with Marcus and participation in temple rituals provides characters with enhanced insight into moral and ethical dilemmas, granting advantage on Wisdom-based checks when dealing with questions of life, death, and spiritual purpose.

## D&D 5e Mechanics

### Sacred Drowning Ritual
