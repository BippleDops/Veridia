# Explosive Object
## Overview
*Magical trap*
Explosive objects are most often fashioned to look tempting to intruders. Ornate chests, works of art, treasures, potions, gems, and more could be a trap.

Any explosive object is powered by a small set of Draconic runes carved in a difficult to discern location on the object. The person who carves the runes chooses a passphrase in Draconic. When the passphrase is spoken aloud (whispering counts) by a person holding the object the trap is rendered inert until that person puts the object down. A DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals the runes to any creature inspecting the object. A character who knows Draconic can determine the passphrase with a DC 15 Intelligence check, though sometimes the passphrase is more difficult to discover and a clever carver may hide it in a riddle within the runes. A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) reveals an odd heat radiating from the object to anyone handling it.

When a creature handles the trapped object, the trap is triggered. Two rounds later at the start of the round the object explodes in a 20-foot-radius burst. Creatures within the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures who fail take 33 (6d10) fire damage. Creatures who succeed take half damage.
