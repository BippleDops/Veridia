The Depth Walker Ranger represents the elite scouts and pathfinders of [[Aquabyssos, masters of navigation through the crushing depths and treacherous underwater terrain. These hardy individuals serve as guides, hunters, and protectors of the deep realms, capable of surviving in environments where others would be crushed by pressure or lost in the endless darkness. ## Core Concept

Depth Walkers are specialized rangers who have adapted to life in the extreme depths of the ocean. They combine traditional ranger skills with unique abilities that allow them to function at crushing depths, navigate by pressure differentials, and communicate with deep-sea creatures. Many serve as guides for expeditions to the [Hadal Zone]] or as scouts for the [[Aquabyssos Royal Navy]]. ### Ranger Archetype: Deep Current Tracker

At 3rd level, Depth Walker Rangers gain access to the Deep Current Tracker archetype: ## Favored Enemies

1. **Aberrations**: Deep Mother cultists, void-touched creatures, reality parasites
2. **Undead**: Drowned dead, bone leviathans, spectral ships
3. **Monstrosities**: Krakens, deep dragons, corrupted sea life
4. **Elementals**: Pressure wraiths, tidal lords, maelstrom spirits ## Favored Terrain

1. **Underwater**: All aquatic environments
2. **Abyssal Plains**: The deepest ocean floors
3. **Kelp Forests**: Dense underwater vegetation
4. **Coral Reefs**: Living underwater cities and structures ### Feature: Depth Routes

You know the safest and most efficient routes through dangerous deep-sea territories. You can guide groups safely through areas that would normally require saving throws for pressure, temperature, or getting lost. You also have contacts among other guides and can secure basic supplies in most deep settlements. ## Progression Notes

- Early levels focus on basic survival and navigation skills
- Mid-levels gain supernatural connection to deep environment
- High levels become supernatural guardians of ocean depths
- Consider multiclassing with Druid (Circle of Land - Coast) or Warlock (Great Old One patron) This build emphasizes the unique challenges and opportunities of the underwater environment while maintaining the core ranger identity of guide, tracker, and protector. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*
