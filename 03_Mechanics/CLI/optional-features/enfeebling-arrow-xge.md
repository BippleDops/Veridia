# Enfeebling Arrow
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 29*  

You weave necromantic magic into your arrow. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra `2d6` necrotic damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.

The necrotic damage increases to `4d6` when you reach 18th level in this class.
