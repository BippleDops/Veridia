# Dragongleam

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Melee Weapon, Spear

**Rarity:** unknown (magic)

**Weight**: 3 lbs.

**Damage:** 1d6 piercing versatile (1d8)

## Description

This spear is enchanted with 10 charges of a [[daylight]]  spell for use in twilight or dark forest underbrush. The command phrase is "Tiamat's eyes shine," written in Draconic runes on the spear's crossguard.

**Thrown.** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
