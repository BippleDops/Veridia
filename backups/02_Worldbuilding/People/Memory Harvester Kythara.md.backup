# Memory Harvester Kythara
*Tender of the Mother's Dreams, Shepherd of Forgotten Thoughts*

## Overview
Kythara tends the [[Memory Meadows]] where the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]]'s pleasant dreams manifest as harvestable memories. Unlike the crude [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Memory Farmers]] who exploit memories for profit, she serves a sacred purposeâ€”collecting and preserving the Deep Mother's dreams to feed back to her sleeping consciousness, maintaining the cycle that keeps Aquabyssos stable. Her shadow-touched nature allows her to navigate the boundary between dream and reality.
