# War Caster
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 209*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th; Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Concentration.** You have Advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Concentration|Concentration]].

**Reactive Spell.** When a creature provokes an [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Opportunity%20Attack|Opportunity Attack]] from you by leaving your reach, you can take a Reaction to cast a spell at the creature rather than making an [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Opportunity%20Attack|Opportunity Attack]]. The spell must have a casting time of one action and must target only that creature.

**Somatic Components.** You can perform the Somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a Shield in one or both hands.
