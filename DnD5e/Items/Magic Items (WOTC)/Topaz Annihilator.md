# Topaz Annihilator

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** legendary

**Attunement**: *requires attunement*

**Damage:** 2d6 necrotic

## Description

This magic ranged weapon resembles a musket, but in lieu of any ammunition, it holds a glowing yellow scale from a topaz dragon in its heart.

The weapon has a normal range of 100 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it has the two-handed property. It deals `dice: 2d6` necrotic damage on a hit. If this damage reduces a creature or object to 0 hit points, the target is reduced to dust. A creature reduced to dust can be restored to life only by a [[true resurrection]]  or [[wish]]  spell.

While the weapon is on your person, you can use an action to cast the [[disintegrate]]  spell (save DC 18). Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
