## Special Traits
**Blood Frenzy:** A crimson basilisk that detects fresh blood within 30 feet enters a frenzied state at the start of its next turn, as do any other crimson basilisks within 30 feet of the frenzied basilisk. Frenzied crimson basilisks fight until they are slain or until 1 minute has passed without the basilisk being attacked. While frenzied, they gain tactical advantage on attack rolls and saving throws, their acid damage increases to 7 (`dice: 2d8`), and their armor class decreases to 11.

**Stone Camouflage**: A crimson basilisk has tactical advantage on Stealth checks in a stony environment or when it has a stony background.

**Wounding Gaze:** A creature within 30 feet of a crimson basilisk that meets the monster's gaze must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Failure means the creature takes 3 (`dice: 1d6`) points of damage as blood weeps from the victim's eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. Creatures without blood and other crimson basilisks are immune to this effect. A creature that is capable of taking actions can look away at the start of its turn to avoid the basilisk's gaze, but if it targets the basilisk while averting its gaze, it suffers all the usual penalties for attacking an unseen target.

## Actions
**Bite:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (`dice: 2d8+3`) piercing damage plus 4 (`dice: 1d8`) acid damage (also see Blood Frenzy above).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Underground

**Organization**: Solitary or pack (2–5)

## Description
Crimson basilisks are variants of the common basilisk, and in some cases more dangerous. Adventurers might be relieved that they won’t be turned to stone, but such relief is usually short-lived when they meet the creature’s gaze.

Crimson basilisks are subterranean carnivores with a voracious appetite that is only whetted when they get the thing they desire most—blood. While they can survive on a diet of plants, mosses, and meat, they prefer blood above all else, and they will even attack their own kind when food is scarce.

A typical crimson basilisk lair is a stony cavern that reeks of blood and whose walls and ground are covered and caked in dried blood. The lair usually contains up to five of these creatures, with an equal chance of males and females. Up to four young are likely to be present as well. Young crimson basilisks do not fight.

A crimson basilisk can grow up to 6 feet long and weigh over 400 pounds. Its tough, armored scales are dull crimson, but it can change its color (as a bonus action) to match its surroundings. Its eight legs are stout and end in sharpened claws. The spines on its back are a darker crimson than its body, especially in males. Its eyes glow with a ghostly blue light.

A crimson basilisk most often attacks from ambush, using its ability to camouflage itself against its surroundings and lying in wait for prey to wander close. They automatically sense the presence of blood within 30 feet; any wounded character is detected automatically within that range. Fortunately, only very fresh blood prompts a frenzy; a basilisk must cause fresh bleeding with its bite or its gaze to trigger the frenzy.
