## Description
Some sages say that our prosperous lands would not be so but for the simple [[Harness|harness]] and yoke. These simple implements place on the backs of beasts the burdens of men. We offer the carriage [[Harnesses|harnesses]] for one (2 gp), two (3 gp), and four (5 gp) horses. We also supply plow [[Harnesses|harnesses]] for one (5 gp) and two (7 gp) horses or oxen. Finally, our oxen yokes can pull a plow through the most stubborn ground—one ox (8 gp) and two oxen (11 gp). Those who have had trouble with oxen strangulation can try our newfangled yoke, which does not pull against the beast’s throat (15 gp and 20 gp).
