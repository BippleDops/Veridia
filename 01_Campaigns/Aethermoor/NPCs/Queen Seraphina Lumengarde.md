# Queen Seraphina Lumengarde
*The Crystal Queen, Light of Aethermoor*

## Overview
Queen Seraphina Lumengarde has ruled [[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/Locations/Aethermoor]] for twelve years, ascending to the throne after her father's mysterious death. Beautiful, intelligent, and politically savvy, she has championed the advancement of crystal technology while trying to maintain peace between the [[Crystal Wardens]] and the [[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/Factions/Purist Coalition]]. Unknown to all but her closest advisors, she suffers from Stage 2 crystal corruption, hidden by powerful illusions.

## Appearance

- **Reality**: Crystalline veins spreading across her left arm and neck, eyes occasionally flash with prismatic light
- **Age**: 32
- **Height**: 5'8"
- **Distinguishing marks**: Crystal crown that never leaves her head (hides corruption)

## Personality
- **Public Persona**: Benevolent, wise, compassionate
- **True Nature**: Increasingly paranoid, desperate, making questionable decisions
- **Fears**: Discovery of her corruption, losing control, becoming fully crystallized
- **Desires**: Find a cure, maintain power, protect her people (conflicting priorities)

## Abilities & Resources
