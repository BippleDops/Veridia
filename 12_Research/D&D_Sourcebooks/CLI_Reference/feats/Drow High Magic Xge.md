# Drow High Magic
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 74*  

**Prerequisite**: [[elf-xphb (races)]]

You learn more of the magic typical of dark elves. You learn the [[detect-magic-xphb (spells)]] spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn [[levitate-xphb (spells)]] and [[dispel-magic-xphb (spells)]], each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast those two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.
