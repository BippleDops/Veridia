***Burden of Time.*** Beasts and humanoids, other than shadar-kai, have disadvantage on saving throws while within 10 feet of the gloom weaver.

***Fey Ancestry.*** The gloom weaver has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put it to sleep.

***Spellcasting.*** The gloom weaver is a 12th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma. It regains its expended spell slots when it finishes a short or long rest. It knows the following warlock spells:

Cantrips: *minor illusion, prestidigitation, chill touch (`dice: 3d8` damage), eldritch blast\**

## Actions

***Shadow Spear.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ( `dice: 1d6+4`) piercing damage plus 26 ( `dice: 4d12`) necrotic damage, or 8 ( `dice: 1d8+4`) piercing damage plus 26 ( `dice: 4d12`) necrotic damage if used with two hands.

## Reactions
***Misty Escape (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** When the gloom weaver takes damage, it turns invisible and teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. It remains invisible until the start of its next turn or until it attacks or casts a spell.

## Description
Although a formidable fighter, a gloom weaver is often content to remain hidden in the shadows, watching with rapt attention as its very presence affects its victims. Its dark energy weighs down the heart, causing those within its oppressive aura to feel the approach of death. This torment alone is enough to please its master, the Raven Queen, but should it be detected, a gloom weaver uses its shadow magic to reduce its enemies to ghastly corpses.
