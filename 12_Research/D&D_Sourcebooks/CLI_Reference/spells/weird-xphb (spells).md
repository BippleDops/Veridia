# Weird
*9th-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You try to create illusory terrors in others' minds. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot-radius [[sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]] centered on a point within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes `10d10` Psychic damage and has the [[conditions#frightened|Frightened]] condition for the duration. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.

A [[conditions#frightened|Frightened]] target makes a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes `5d10` Psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends on that target.

**Classes**: [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-illusionist-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Wizard (Illusionist)]]; [[list-spells-classes-warlock|Warlock]]; [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]; [[list-spells-classes-wizard|Wizard]]

## Player-Facing Summary

Weird xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of weird xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around weird xphb.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
