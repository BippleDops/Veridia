# Seeming
*5th-level, Illusion*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 8 hours

You give an illusory appearance to each creature of your choice that you can see within range. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.

You can give the same appearance or different ones to the targets. The spell can change the appearance of the targets' bodies and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear heavier or lighter. A target's new appearance must have the same basic arrangement of limbs as the target, but the extent of the illusion is otherwise up to you. The spell lasts for the duration.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature's outfit, objects pass through the hat.

A creature that takes the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Study|Study]] action to examine a target can make an Intelligence ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Investigation|Investigation]]) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.

## Player-Facing Summary

Seeming xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of seeming xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around seeming xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties seeming xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at seeming xphb to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to seeming xphb active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
