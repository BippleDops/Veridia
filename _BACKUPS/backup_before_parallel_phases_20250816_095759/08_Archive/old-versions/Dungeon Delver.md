--- # Dungeon Delver

*Source: Player's Handbook p. 166* Alert to the hidden traps and secret doors found in many dungeons, you gain the following benefits: - You have advantage on Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception) and Intelligence ([skills#Investigation|Investigation]]) checks made to detect the presence of secret doors. - You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid or resist traps. - You have resistance to the damage dealt by traps. - Traveling at a fast pace doesn't impose the normal -5 penalty on your passive Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) score. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Dungeon delver is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of dungeon delver as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around dungeon delver. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
