These tiny demons use chaos and violence to terrorize others. By shape-shifting into harmless but ill-omened creatures or by turning [conditions#Invisible|invisible]], quasits sneak into places where they spy for villainous masters or set vicious traps. Quasits delight in hiding in dark places andâ€”when least expectedâ€”bursting forth to slash foes with their [[conditions#Poisoned|poisoned]] claws. Quasits are usually overlooked and underestimated by other demons. This drives them to prove themselves through cruel acts or by seeking paths to the Material Plane. Among mortals, quasits sow senseless chaos, and they might find kindred evil spirits among violent cultists and magic-users. > [!quote] A quote from Otto the Bard > > A thing doesn't need to be big to be gut-flippingly dreadful. Just think of all the folks who're squeamish around spiders. Now imagine a spider as big as a cat and that wants to steal your tongue.```statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of quasit xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around quasit xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Hidden Prophecy of Winds ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
