# Winged Boots
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/winged-boots.webp#right)

These boots have 4 charges and regain `d4` expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the boots, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to expend 1 charge, gaining a [[Fly Speed Xphb]] of 30 feet for 1 hour. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.
