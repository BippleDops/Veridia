*Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 119* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/races/img/kobold.webp#right) - **Ability Scores**: dex +2
- **Size**: Small
- **Speed**: 30 ft. ### Age Kobolds reach adulthood at age 6 and can live up to 120 years but rarely do so. ### Size Kobolds are between 2 and 3 feet tall and weigh between 25 and 35 pounds. Your size is Small. ### Darkvision You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. ### Grovel, Cower, and Beg As an action on your turn, you can cower pathetically to distract nearby foes. Until the end of your next turn, your allies gain advantage on attack rolls against enemies within 10 feet of you that you can see. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest. ### Pack Tactics You have advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [[conditions#Incapacitated|incapacitated]]. ### Sunlight Sensitivity You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight. ### Languages You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Kobold vgm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of kobold vgm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around kobold vgm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
