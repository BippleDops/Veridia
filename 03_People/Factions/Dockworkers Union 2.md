# Dockworkers Union

## General Info
**Location**: Shadowhaven Docks

## Overview

The Dockworkers Union stands as one of the most powerful labor organizations in both [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Aquabyssos World Guide|Aquabyssos]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Aethermoor World Guide|Aethermoor]], representing the countless workers who load cargo, maintain vessels, and keep the cross-realm trade flowing. Founded during the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Continental War|Great Trade Disputes]], the Union has evolved from a simple workers' protection group into a quasi-governmental force that can shut down entire port cities through coordinated strikes.

The Union operates massive dock complexes in both realms, adapting their infrastructure for underwater cargo handling in Aquabyssos and aerial freight management in Aethermoor. Their unique position handling goods at dimensional crossing points has given them access to incredible wealth and political influence, making them essential allies or dangerous enemies for anyone involved in inter-realm commerce.

## Structure

**Union High Command:**
- **Dock Master General Thresh "Ironhook" Valdris**: A grizzled veteran who lost his left arm to a pressure-kraken but replaced it with a crystalline prosthetic
- **Deputy Master Coral Strongcurrent**: Former Aquabyssos naval officer who coordinates underwater operations
- **Wind Warden Marcus Cloudlift**: Aethermoor representative specializing in aerial cargo and skyship operations

**Regional Chapters:**
- **Meridian Deep Docks**: Handles the majority of pressure-sensitive cargo and crystal shipments
- **Shadowhaven Port Complex**: Manages the more questionable trade routes and "no questions asked" shipping
- **Cloudspire Aerial Terminals**: Coordinates skyship landings and wind-cargo operations
- **Border Station Hubs**: Union workers who specialize in dimensional crossing protocols

The Union maintains its own **Stevedore Tribunals** to handle disputes, **Strike Coordination Councils** to organize work actions, and **Mutual Aid Societies** that provide support for injured or displaced workers.

## Goals

- **Worker Protection**: Ensure safe working conditions despite the hazards of dimensional cargo handling
- **Economic Power**: Maintain control over shipping rates and cargo priorities
- **Political Influence**: Shape trade policies in both realms to benefit working-class interests
- **Territory Expansion**: Extend Union control to smaller ports and emerging trade routes
- **Cross-Realm Solidarity**: Unite workers from both realms against merchant exploitation

## Assets

- **Port Infrastructure**: Direct control over key loading facilities and shipping lanes
- **Mechanical Expertise**: Advanced knowledge of both pressure-resistant and wind-powered cargo systems
- **Intelligence Network**: Workers see everything that passes through the docks, providing valuable information
- **Strike Funds**: Massive financial reserves to support extended work stoppages
- **Enforcement Arms**: The "Dock Guard" - union enforcers who ensure compliance with labor agreements
- **Emergency Response Teams**: Specialized units trained for dimensional cargo disasters

## Conflicts

- **Merchant Resistance**: The [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Guilds/Merchants Guild|Merchants Guild]] constantly seeks to break Union power through stricter contracts
- **Automation Threats**: New magical systems threaten to replace traditional dock workers
- **Corruption Scandals**: Some Union leaders have been accused of taking bribes from [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Criminal_Organizations/The Shadowhaven Smugglers Ring|smuggling operations]]
- **Inter-Realm Tensions**: Political crises between the realms put Union neutrality at risk
- **Internal Divisions**: Disagreements between traditionalist and progressive factions within the Union

## Hooks

- **The Silent Docks**: All Union workers have mysteriously stopped working, but they remain at their posts, staring silently at the water
- **The Pressure Plague**: Dock workers are developing strange mutations from handling corrupted cargo, and the Union is covering it up
- **The False Valdris**: Thresh "Ironhook" Valdris has been acting strangely, and some suspect he's been replaced by a [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Criminal_Organizations/Shadow Surgeons Collective|Shadow Surgeon]] duplicate

## Player-Facing Summary

The Dockworkers Union controls the lifeblood of inter-realm commerce through sheer collective power and intimate knowledge of how goods move between worlds. Their members are easily recognized by their distinctive pressure-proof coveralls and wind-resistant cloaks, while their union halls echo with sea shanties and work songs that carry across both water and air. The Union represents honest working folk who've grown powerful enough to challenge merchant princes and government officials alike.

## Lore Details

The Union emerged from the chaos of the **Dock Riots of 723 AC**, when workers in both realms simultaneously refused to handle cargo they suspected was contaminated with [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Crystal Corruption|Crystal Corruption]]. The coordinated action—despite no communication between the realms—convinced many that the working classes shared a mystical connection that transcended dimensional boundaries.

**Union Traditions** include the **Morning Bell Ceremony** where workers in both realms ring massive bells at dawn, the sound somehow carrying across dimensional barriers. The **Solidarity Feast** occurs monthly, with union halls sharing the same menu to symbolize their unity. Workers develop their own slang—"pressure-blessed" means having good luck, while "wind-cursed" indicates impending trouble.

The Union's **Memorial Walls** list workers lost to dimensional accidents, pressure implosions, and wind-shear incidents. Each name is carved in both Aquabyssos pressure-script and Aethermoor wind-runes, ensuring no worker is forgotten regardless of their realm of origin.

**Sensory Details**: Union halls smell of salt spray mixed with machine oil, resonating with the rhythmic hammering of cargo nets and the creaking of dimensional stabilizers. Workers' callused hands tell stories of countless loads moved, while their weathered faces reflect years of exposure to pressure changes and wind burn.

## Adventure Hooks

- A valuable shipment of [[02_Worldbuilding/Items/Memory Pearls|Memory Pearls]] has gone missing from Union custody, and both realms are demanding explanations
- Strange new cargo containers are arriving with no manifest records, and Union workers are forbidden from opening them under threat of immediate termination
- The Union's financial records show massive payments from unknown sources, coinciding with increased [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Criminal_Organizations/The Shadow Conspiracy|Shadow Conspiracy]] activity at the docks

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
