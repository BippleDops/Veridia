## Traits

### Pack Tactics

You have advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't [[conditions#Incapacitated|incapacitated]].

### Sunlight Sensitivity

You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

### Darkvision

Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.

## Player-Facing Summary

Kobold dmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of kobold dmg as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around kobold dmg.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties kobold dmg to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at kobold dmg to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to kobold dmg active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
