## Overview

Economic crime in [Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos has evolved into sophisticated methodologies that exploit the complex ficial systems connecting both realms.

## Player-Facing Summary

Economic Crime Methods represent sophisticated approaches to illegal profit that exploit the complex ficial systems connecting both realms. Understanding these methods provides insight into the darker side of commerce while creating opportunities for adventure involving investigation, infiltration, and moral complexity.

## Lore Details

Ancient criminal texts speak of the "Perfect Crime" - a theoretical economic fraud so sophisticated that it actually improves the economy while stealing from it, creating value while destroying it, and benefiting everyone while harming everyone. Some economists argue that such a crime would be indistinguishable from legitimate innovation.

Deep-sea criminal philosophers maintain that at extreme depths, the pressure makes economic crimes physically manifest, creating visible distortions in reality that reflect the moral distortions of ficial fraud. They claim that the most sophisticated economic criminals eventually become unable to exist at normal pressures.

## [[DM_Notes|DM Notes

Use economic crimes as more than just background elements - make them active forces that shape the political and social landscape of your campaign. Economic crime can provide adventure hooks that combine mystery, politics, moral complexity, and social commentary.

Consider how different types of economic crime create different kinds of moral questions for player characters. Tax evasion, money laundering, and market manipulation each involve different ethical issues and create different types of victims.

The sophisticated nature of economic crime allows for complex plots that develop over multiple sessions, requiring careful investigation, strategic thinking, and difficult moral decisions. These crimes often involve legitimate institutions and respected individuals, creating ambiguity about who can be trusted.
