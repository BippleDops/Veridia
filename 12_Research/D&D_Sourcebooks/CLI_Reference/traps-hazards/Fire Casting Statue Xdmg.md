--- # Fire-Casting Statue

*Generic Hazard* When a creature moves onto this trap's pressure plate for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, a nearby statue exhales a 15-foot [[Area of Effect Xphb]] of magical flame. The statue can look like anything, such as a dragon or a wizard. Each creature in the Cone must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (`2d10`) Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Detect and Disarm A [[detect-magic-xphb (spells)]] spell reveals an aura of Evocation magic around the statue. As a [[actions#Search|Search]] action, a creature within 5 feet of the statue can examine it and make a DC 10 Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) check, detecting a tiny glyph on the statue on a successful check. Once the glyph is found, a character can take a [[actions#Study|Study]] action to examine it and make a DC 15 Intelligence ([[skills#Arcana|Arcana]]) check, ascertaining that the glyph means "fire" on a successful check. As an action, a character can use a sharp tool to deface the glyph, which disarms the trap. As a [[actions#Search|Search]] action, a creature can examine the section of floor that forms the pressure plate and make a DC 15 Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) check, detecting the pressure plate on a successful check. Wedging an [[Iron Spikes Xphb]] or similar object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from triggering. ## At Higher Levels You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing the damage and the area of effect, as shown in the following table. | Levels | Fire Damage | Area of Effect |


|--------|-------------|----------------|
| 5â€“10 | 22 (`4d10`) | 30-foot Cone |
| 11â€“16 | 55 (`10d10`) | 60-foot Cone |
| 17â€“20 | 99 (`18d10`) | 120-foot Cone |
