## Special Traits
***Life Hunger.*** If a creature the Hungry can see regains hit points, the Hungry gains two benefits until the end of its next turn: it has advantage on attack rolls, and its bite deals an extra 22 ( `dice: 4d10`) necrotic damage on a hit.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The Hungry makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 ( `dice: 1d8+4`) piercing damage plus 13 ( `dice: 3d8`) necrotic damage.

***Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 ( `dice: 4d6+4`) slashing damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 16) and is restrained until the grapple ends. While grappling a creature, the Hungry can't attack with its claws.

## Description
Horrid beasts with grasping claws and yawning mouths, the Hungry do whatever is necessary to sate their appetites. These greedy devourers consume all life and energy they encounter, stuffing their maws with flesh and drinking in their victims' screams. When they finish, they lurch away while their bright eyes resume the search for something else to consume.
