## üìù Session Summary

The party began their investigation into the missing merchant vessels at the request of [[01_Campaigns/Campaign_Name/NPCs/Councillor Elara Brightwater.md]]. What started as a straightforward missing persons case quickly revealed layers of corruption, supernatural interference, and political intrigue that run deep through Shadowhaven's maritime trade.

**Key Achievement**: Advanced [[01_Campaigns/Campaign_Name/Quests/The Vanishing Merchant Vessels.md]] quest from 10% to 35% completion.

## üé¨ Key Scenes

### Scene 1: The Council's Request (45 minutes)
**Location**: [[01_Campaigns/Campaign_Name/Locations/Shadowhaven.md]] - Council Chambers

The session opened with the party being summoned to a private meeting with [[01_Campaigns/Campaign_Name/NPCs/Councillor Elara Brightwater.md]] in her personal office overlooking the harbor. The morning light streaming through the windows couldn't hide the worry lines around her eyes.

**Elara's Briefing**:
- Three merchant vessels vanished in the past month: *Windwhisper*, *Golden Current*, and *Prosperity's Dream*
- Each disappearance followed a similar pattern: routine departure, normal initial contact, then complete silence
- Official guild investigators have found nothing but conflicting witness reports
- Political tension between guilds is reaching dangerous levels

**Key Character Moments**:
- **Kira** (Moonwhisper) immediately suspected supernatural involvement, asking about lunar cycles
- **Marcus** (Sir Blackstone) focused on the military implications, especially the missing weapons shipment
- **Luna** (Shadowstep) was intrigued by the potential for uncovering corruption
- **Theo** (Spellwright) requested access to magical detection resources

**Information Gained**:
- Access to harbor records and guild facilities
- 500 gp expense account for investigation costs
- Promise of significant rewards for successful resolution
- Warning about political sensitivities - discretion essential

### Scene 2: Harbor Investigation (75 minutes)
**Location**: [[Harbor Master's Office]] and Harbor District

The party's first stop was the harbor master's office, where they met [[Harbormaster Willem Tidecaller]] - a nervous man clearly hiding something.

**Key Discoveries**:
- **Shipping Logs**: Minor discrepancies in departure times, suggesting someone altered records after the fact
- **Communication Records**: The *Golden Current*'s last message mentioned "strange lights on the horizon"
- **Financial Records**: Several dock workers received unexpected bonuses in the weeks before disappearances

**Harbormaster's Behavior**: Willem was evasive about specific questions, kept glancing toward a locked filing cabinet, and his hands shook when discussing the *Prosperity's Dream*

**Player Actions**:
- **Luna** attempted to pickpocket Willem's keys (failed, but he didn't notice)
- **Theo** detected lingering enchantment magic on the communication crystals
- **Kira** noticed unusual wear patterns on harbor equipment suggesting it had been moved recently
- **Marcus** questioned the security protocols and found several gaps in the guard rotations

**Evidence Obtained**:
- Strange compass found floating near the *Golden Current*'s last known position - needle spins wildly around a central point
- Scorched rope with magical residue (Theo identified it as conjuration magic)

### Scene 3: The Salty Anchor Tavern (60 minutes)
**Location**: [[The Salty Anchor Tavern]]

The party followed up on witness testimonies at the tavern where sailors gather to drink and share stories. They met [[Marianne Crowley]], the sharp-eyed tavern keeper, and [[Old Salt Pete]], a retired sailor with interesting stories.

**Marianne's Information**:
- Several regular customers have been acting strangely since the disappearances
- Unusual number of "foreign merchants" asking questions about shipping schedules
- Someone's been paying good money for information about specific cargo manifests

**Old Salt Pete's Tale** (Investigation Check DC 15 - Success):
- Claimed to see "ships that sailed in shadow" on the night the *Windwhisper* vanished
- Described crews that "moved like they were dancing to unheard music"
- Mentioned seeing the same black-sailed vessels three times, always just before dawn

**Tavern Atmosphere**:
- Conversations stopped when the party entered, resumed as whispers
- Several patrons left immediately upon seeing them
- Marianne served drinks with subtle hand signals to certain customers

**Player Roleplay Highlights**:
- **Marcus** bought rounds for the house to loosen tongues (successful Persuasion)
- **Luna** eavesdropped on private conversations using her criminal contacts background
- **Kira** used her natural empathy to comfort sailors' families affected by the disappearances
- **Theo** analyzed the magical residue publicly, causing quite a stir

### Scene 4: The Docks at Sunset (40 minutes)
**Location**: Shadowhaven Harbor - Pier 7

Following up on Old Salt Pete's information, the party investigated the specific pier where the *Golden Current* was moored before its disappearance.

**Discovery - Strange Barnacles**:
- Unusual barnacles growing on the pier supports
- Species unknown to local marine life (Nature Check DC 18 - Kira succeeded)
- They pulse with faint, otherworldly light at sunset
- When touched, they emit a sound like distant singing

**Investigation Results**:
- **Theo's Arcana Check**: The barnacles radiate faint enchantment magic
- **Luna's Perception**: Fresh scrape marks on the pier, as if something large was recently tied up here
- **Marcus's Investigation**: Found hidden beneath the pier - a sailor's personal effects including a letter
- **Kira's Survival**: Tracked unusual footprints - not quite human, definitely not boots

**The Sailor's Letter**: 
A personal note from crew member of the *Golden Current* to his family, never sent:
*"Ma, something's not right about this voyage. Captain Elena's been checking her charts obsessively, and the new cargo makes the ship feel... wrong. If you don't hear from me within a month, check the old hiding spot behind the bakery. I've left something there that might explain what happened to us."*

### Scene 5: The Mysterious Contact (Combat - 20 minutes)
**Location**: Harbor District - Behind the Warehouse

As the party prepared to investigate the letter's clue, they were ambushed by three hired thugs attempting to steal their evidence and silence their investigation.

**Combat Encounter**: 3 Thugs (CR 1/2 each)
- **Initiative Order**: Luna (18), Marcus (15), Thug Leader (12), Kira (11), Thugs 2&3 (9), Theo (7)

**Combat Highlights**:
- **Luna** opened with sneak attack using her shortsword (critical hit, 18 damage)
- **Marcus** used Action Surge to take down the leader with two attacks
- **Kira** provided cover with her longbow, landing two solid hits
- **Theo** cast *Sleep* spell to incapacitate the last thug for questioning

**Information from Captured Thug** (Intimidation Check DC 12 - Success):
- Hired by "a fancy gentleman in a dark coat"
- Paid to watch the docks and report on anyone asking too many questions
- Told to "discourage" investigation but not to kill unless necessary
- Meeting location: abandoned warehouse in the Merchant Quarter tomorrow night

**Loot**: 45 gp total, crude weapons, a note with meeting instructions (in code that Luna recognized from her criminal background)
