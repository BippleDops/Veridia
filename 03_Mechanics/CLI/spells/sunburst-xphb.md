# Sunburst
*8th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of sunstone)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot-radius [Sphere](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in the [Sphere](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `12d6` Radiant damage and has the [Blinded](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Blinded) condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only.

A creature [Blinded](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Blinded) by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

This spell dispels [Darkness](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) in its area that was created by any spell.

**Classes**: [Druid](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Cleric](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Wizard (Evoker)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-evoker-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Wizard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
