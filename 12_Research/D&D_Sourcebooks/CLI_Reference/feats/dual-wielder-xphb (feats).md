--- # Dual Wielder

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 203* **Prerequisite**: 4th; Strength 13 or higher or 4th; Dexterity 13 or higher You gain the following benefits. **Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Strength or Dexterity by 1, to a maximum of 20. **Enhanced Dual Wielding.** When you take the [[actions#Attack|Attack]] action on your turn and attack with a weapon that has the Light property, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn with a different weapon, which must be a Melee weapon that lacks the Two-Handed property. You don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. **Quick Draw.** You can draw or stow two weapons that lack the Two-Handed property when you would normally be able to draw or stow only one. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Dual wielder xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
