*This enormous humanoid stands well over 9 feet tall. Its flesh is a very dark blue-green and glistens as if coated with oil. Its head is oval and pointed, and its eyes show as dull, ivory-colored pits without visible pupils. Its mouth is almost too wide for its face and is crowded with two rows of fanglike teeth and a long, snaky tongue that flicks in and out past its thin, scaly lips. The monster’s powerful arms and legs end in wicked claws that sport broken, jagged, yet incredibly sharp and tough fingernails.*

## Special Traits
**Aura of Evil:** A grimm constantly exudes a miasma of evil around itself. Any creature that begins its turn within 5 feet of a grimm takes `dice: 2d6` radiant damage. Creatures of evil alignment are immune to this effect.

**Diehard:** A grimm does not die when it reaches 0 hit points. Instead, the creature continues fighting, but it must make a Constitution saving throw every time it takes damage while at 0 hit points. The DC of the saving throw equals the damage from the attack. The first time the grimm fails this saving throw, it gains tactical disadvantage on all its attack rolls and ability checks, but it keeps fighting. When it fails this saving throw for a second time, it dies instantly.

**Devour:** If both of a grimm's claw attacks and its bite attack hit the same target in a single turn, the grimm gains temporary hit points equal to the piercing damage done by its bite. Ethereal Jaunt (recharge 5, 6). A grimm can shift between the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane as a bonus action when it moves. It can remain on the Ethereal Plane only until ethereal jaunt recharges; it must return to the Material Plane on the first turn it can (but not necessarily as the first thing it does that turn; the grimm could move in the Ethereal Plane before returning to the Material Plane). While in the Ethereal Plane, the grimm can't be seen or harmed by anyone on the Material Plane except by magical effects that cross the planar boundary. It can see and hear what is around it (within 60 feet) on the Material Plane, but it can't harm anything in the Material Plane. While Ethereal, the grimm can move in any direction, even up or down and through solid objects, but it treats all space as difficult terrain.

**Ethereal Jaunt (recharge 5, 6):** A grimm can shift between the Ethereal Plane and the Material Plane as a bonus action when it moves. It can remain on the Ethereal Plane only until ethereal jaunt recharges; it must return to the Material Plane on the first turn it can (but not necessarily as the first thing it does that turn; the grimm could move in the Ethereal Plane before returning to the Material Plane). While in the Ethereal Plane, the grimm can’t be seen or harmed by anyone on the Material Plane except by magical effects that cross the planar boundary. It can see and hear what is around it (within 60 feet) on the Material Plane, but it can’t harm anything in the Material Plane. While Ethereal, the grimm can move in any direction, even up or down and through solid objects, but it treats all space as difficult terrain.

**Spell-like Abilities:** A grimm can use the following spell-like abilities, using Charisma as its casting ability (DC 14, attack +6). The grimm doesn’t need material components to use these abilities.

- At Will: *blur*

- 3/day: *call lightning, darkness, detect fey (as detect evil and good but detects fey only)*

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A grimm attacks twice with its claws, then bites once.

**Claw:** *Melee Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (`dice: 1d10+5`) slashing damage. If both claw attacks hit the same target, the grimm gains tactical advantage on its bite attack if it makes that attack immediately against the same target.

**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 21 (`dice: 3d10+5`) piercing damage. Also see devour, above.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Mountains

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
A grimm is one of the most evil of all fey. Conceived and created by members of the Unseelie Court, the monster’s only purpose seems to be the destruction of life and that which is beautiful. Legends among the fairy folk say powerful members of the Unseelie Court created this fell beast (legends say a circle of powerful quickling sorcerers are responsible) to avenge the death of their kin who were slain when the Seelie and Unseelie Courts did battle.

Grimms dwell in the deepest and darkest mountains, making their lairs in deep recesses or hard to access caves and caverns, venturing forth only to kill and to eat. They eat only meat—the fresher the better, and the flesh of good-aligned fey creatures is their top choice. Any creature that crosses their path, however, is fair game. These creatures are highly territorial and do not associate with other creatures, even their own kind, for long without some force such as a powerful Unseelie noble compelling them to.

A grimm stands 9 feet tall and is stout and powerfully built. Its body ripples with muscles and is always covered in a glossy sheen.

In combat, grimm’s focus their attacks on single opponents, hoping to gain temporary hit points by devouring part of their foe. If the tide of battle turns against it, a grimm will try to flee through the Ethereal Plane, but this is an unreliable gambit.
