This sweet-tasting liquid causes the character drinking it to become [[Charmed|charmed]] with the first creature she sees after consuming the draft (as [[Charm Person|charm person]]â€”the drinker must be a humanoid of Medium or smaller size, Will DC 14 negates). The [[Charmed|charm]] effects wear off in `dice: 1d3` hours.
