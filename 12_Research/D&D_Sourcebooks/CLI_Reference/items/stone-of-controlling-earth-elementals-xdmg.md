# Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/stone-of-controlling-earth-elementals.webp#right)

While touching this 5-pound stone to the ground, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to summon an [[earth-elemental-xmm|Earth Elemental]]. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your [[initiative-xphb|Initiative]] count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]]. The stone can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
