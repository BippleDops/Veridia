## Adventure Overview

**The Void Breach** is a 6-session horror investigation adventure designed for characters of levels 7-9. The adventure focuses on psychological horror, reality corruption, and the slow revelation of cosmic truth. Characters will investigate a series of increasingly disturbing incidents in a remote coastal town, ultimately discovering a tear in the fabric of reality itself that threatens to consume all existence.

This module emphasizes **investigation over combat**, **atmosphere over action**, and **psychological consequences over physical danger**. Characters will face challenges that cannot be solved with sword and spell alone, requiring lateral thinking, moral choices with terrible costs, and the courage to confront truths that human minds were never meant to comprehend.

### Aquabyssos Setting Integration
This adventure works best when placed in the broader context of the [[Aquabyssos]] setting, where reality is already under strain from dimensional convergence and the influence of cosmic entities like the [[Deep Mother]]. The void breach represents a different but related threatâ€”not oceanic corruption but the hunger of the space between spaces.

**Recommended Placement:**
- After characters have experienced at least one major Deep Mother encounter
- During a period of apparent calm in the broader cosmic conflict
- As a side investigation that reveals new layers of cosmic threat
- When party sanity levels are relatively stable (this will change quickly)

## Managing Horror Tone

Running effective horror requires careful attention to atmosphere, pacing, and player comfort. This section provides tools and guidance for maintaining the right tone throughout the adventure.

### Establishing Atmosphere

**Pre-Game Preparation:**
- Discuss horror boundaries and comfort levels with all players
- Establish safety tools (X-Card, Lines and Veils, Open Door policy)
- Set expectations that this adventure focuses on psychological rather than physical threats
- Explain that character death is less likely than character transformation/corruption

**Environmental Storytelling:**
- Describe familiar things that are subtly wrong
- Use all five senses in your descriptions
- Focus on implications rather than explicit descriptions
- Build tension through anticipation rather than shock

**Pacing Techniques:**
- Alternate between investigation/exploration and horror encounters
- Use quiet character moments to build investment before horror strikes
- Allow players processing time after particularly intense scenes
- Know when to pull back and when to escalate

### Safety and Boundaries

**Content Warnings:**
This adventure contains themes and imagery involving:
- Body horror and involuntary transformation
- Madness and loss of identity
- Cosmic insignificance and existential dread
- Community breakdown and betrayal
- Reality distortion and unreliable perception

**Safety Tools:**
- **X-Card**: Any player can pause the game if content becomes uncomfortable
- **Lines and Veils**: Establish what content is completely off-limits vs. handled off-screen
- **Open Door**: Players can leave without explanation if needed
- **Check-Ins**: Regular brief pauses to ensure everyone is comfortable
- **Aftercare**: Debrief sessions after intense horror scenes

**Red Lines (Avoid Entirely):**
- Graphic depictions of real-world trauma
- Sexual violence or assault
- Detailed child endangerment
- Self-harm as a solution to problems
- Permanent character destruction without player consent

### Sanity System Implementation

This adventure uses the [[Sanity_Horror_Framework|Sanity Horror Framework]] with the following modifications and additions:

#### Void Corruption Rules

**Void Exposure Tracking:**
Characters gain **Void Exposure Points** when:
- Witnessing void-touched entities (1 point)
- Entering reality-distorted areas (2 points per hour)
- Using void-corrupted items (1 point per use)
- Performing void-related rituals (3-5 points)
- Making contact with the breach itself (10 points)

**Void Corruption Effects:**

| Exposure Points | Effects |
|-----------------|---------|
| 0-5 | No noticeable effects |
| 6-10 | Occasional spatial disorientation |
| 11-15 | Difficulty distinguishing reality from hallucination |
| 16-20 | Spontaneous geometric nightmares |
| 21-25 | Reality begins to seem negotiable |
| 26+ | Void consciousness begins to override human awareness |

#### Breaking Points Specific to Void Horror

**Void-Specific Breaking Points:**
- Seeing loved ones transformed beyond recognition
- Realizing one's own memories may be false
- Witnessing the deletion of a person from existence
- Understanding that reality is infinitely fragile
- Making contact with void consciousness

#### Sanity Restoration in Void Context

**Standard restoration methods are less effective:**
- Natural recovery: Half normal rate in void-affected areas
- Medical treatment: May worsen condition if practitioner is void-touched
- Magical healing: Risk of void contamination
- Memory therapy: Dangerous when memories themselves are corrupted

**Void-Specific Recovery Methods:**
- **Reality Anchoring**: Focus on undeniably real sensations (pain, pleasure, physical contact)
- **Collective Memory**: Group recitation of shared experiences
- **Creative Expression**: Art, music, or writing that asserts human meaning
- **Ritual Cleansing**: Specific rites that reinforce reality boundaries
- **Void Resistance Training**: Learning to compartmentalize void experiences

## Adventure Hooks

Choose or modify these hooks based on your campaign's current situation:

### Hook 1: The Disturbing Letter
**Best For:** Parties with ties to coastal communities or shipping interests

A merchant contact sends an urgent letter describing increasingly strange incidents in the fishing village of Grimhaven. Ships return with crews who don't remember the voyage. Children draw pictures of places that don't exist. The local priest has barricaded himself in the temple and won't stop praying. The merchant offers substantial payment for investigating what's causing the disturbances.

**Investigation Thread:** Character background connections draw them to help
**Horror Element:** Creeping normalcy violation in a familiar setting

### Hook 2: The Missing Scholar
**Best For:** Parties with academic or magical connections

Dr. Elara Voidwright, a respected researcher of dimensional phenomena, sent increasingly frantic letters about a "breakthrough in understanding reality's substrate" before going completely silent three weeks ago. Her university colleagues hire the party to investigate her last known location: the remote town of Grimhaven, where she was studying "unusual spatial anomalies."

**Investigation Thread:** Following academic trail and research notes
**Horror Element:** Knowledge-seeker's hubris leading to cosmic contact

### Hook 3: The Prophetic Dream
**Best For:** Parties already dealing with cosmic entities or prophecies

One or more characters begin experiencing shared nightmares of a fishing village consumed by "hungry darkness." The dreams are too vivid and consistent to be natural, suggesting supernatural or prophetic origin. The visions show specific landmarks that allow the party to identify the real location: Grimhaven.

**Investigation Thread:** Following prophetic visions and dream logic
**Horror Element:** Being drawn by forces beyond understanding

### Hook 4: The Distress Signal
**Best For:** Parties with heroic tendencies

A magical message arrives requesting immediate help from Grimhaven's mayor. The message is partially corrupted, mentioning "reality failing" and "people disappearing in plain sight." By the time the party arrives, they find that no one in town remembers sending the message, and there's no record of a mayor by that name.

**Investigation Thread:** Investigating impossible evidence
**Horror Element:** Unreliable reality from the start

### Hook 5: The Government Contract
**Best For:** Parties with official connections or those motivated by payment

Government agents approach the party with a lucrative but classified contract. Several coastal towns have reported similar "anomalous incidents" in recent months, but Grimhaven represents the most severe case. The agents provide little information beyond promising excellent compensation for a full report on the situation.

**Investigation Thread:** Official investigation with limited information
**Horror Element:** Authority figures may be compromised

### Session Breakdown
1. **Session 1 - Strange Tidings**: Arrival and initial investigation
2. **Session 2 - The Infected Town**: Discovering the extent of corruption
3. **Session 3 - Into the Depths**: Following the source underground
4. **Session 4 - Reality Unraveling**: Navigating impossible spaces
5. **Session 5 - The Breach Point**: Confronting the source
6. **Session 6 - Sealing the Void**: Final choices and consequences

### Parallel Tracks
The adventure operates on multiple simultaneous tracks:

**Investigation Track:** Gathering clues about the void breach's nature and origin
**Corruption Track:** The town's gradual transformation and the party's exposure
**Relationship Track:** Building connections with NPCs who may need to be saved or lost
**Sanity Track:** Managing psychological deterioration while staying functional
**Solution Track:** Discovering possible ways to address the breach

### Flexibility and Adaptation
This adventure is designed to be **investigation-driven** rather than **railroad-driven**. The specific events and their order can be adjusted based on:
- Player actions and interests
- Party composition and capabilities
- Horror tolerance and engagement levels
- Time constraints and session length

**Key Principle:** The void breach continues to grow and corrupt regardless of party actions, but the specific manifestations should respond to what the players find most engaging or concerning.

### Investigation System
This adventure uses a **Three-Clue Rule** approach: for every key revelation, provide at least three different ways for characters to discover it. This ensures that investigation maintains momentum even if players miss obvious clues.

**Clue Types:**
- **Physical Evidence**: Objects, marks, or traces left by void corruption
- **Witness Testimony**: What NPCs have seen, though their reliability may be questionable
- **Environmental Clues**: Changes to the landscape, architecture, or natural phenomena
- **Documentary Evidence**: Letters, journals, official records, or academic notes
- **Behavioral Patterns**: How people and animals are acting differently

### Corruption Progression
The void breach's influence grows stronger throughout the adventure:

**Day 1-2**: Subtle wrongness and minor reality glitches
**Day 3-4**: Obvious supernatural events and NPC behavioral changes
**Day 5-6**: Major reality distortions and visible transformations
**Day 7+**: Widespread corruption and impossible phenomena

### Multiple Solutions
The adventure provides several potential approaches to resolving the void breach:

**The Seal Approach**: Close the breach through ritual and sacrifice
**The Redirect Approach**: Channel the void energy elsewhere
**The Integration Approach**: Find a way for the town to coexist with void corruption
**The Sacrifice Approach**: Someone enters the void to close it from within
**The Transformation Approach**: Embrace the change and guide its direction

Each approach requires different costs and has different consequences for the surviving NPCs and the broader world.

## Conclusion

The Void Breach represents horror not through overwhelming force, but through the gradual erosion of everything characters believe to be real and permanent. Success is measured not in monsters defeated but in sanity preserved, people saved, and meaning maintained in the face of cosmic indifference.

Remember that the greatest horror comes not from the unknown, but from the moment when the unknown becomes knownâ€”and that knowledge reveals how small and fragile our understanding of reality truly is.

*"In the end, we learned that reality is not a foundation but a thin film stretched over an infinite abyss. We had always walked on water; we simply never looked down."*

**Next:** Begin with [[Session_1_Strange_Tidings|Session 1 Strange Tidings]] to start the investigation.

## Player-Facing Summary

Introduction is a void-touched element of the setting, known for impossible angles and star-silent echoes. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Introduction as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Introduction.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
