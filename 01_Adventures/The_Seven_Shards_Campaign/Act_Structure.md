# The Seven Shards Campaign

## Structure
- Levels: 1–20
- Arcs: Seven shard arcs + prologue and epilogue
- Sessions: 35+ planned, modular

## Arcs
1) Prologue: Rumors of Resonance
2) Verdant Shard: Seeds and Sanctions
3) Crimson Shard: Blood and Bargains
4) Azure Shard: Storm and Signal
5) Umbral Shard: Shadows and Oaths
6) Gilded Shard: Wealth and Wards
7) Tidal Shard: Memory and Mercy
8) Crown Shard: Sovereignty and Song
9) Epilogue: The Second Rising

## Session Outlines
- Each arc includes 4–6 sessions with flex scenes: investigation, travel, social, and set-piece.

## Multiple Endings
- Union of Realms
- Partition with Treaties
- Shattered Sovereignty

## Pregenerated Characters
- 5 pregens with realm ties and shard affinities. See [[01_Adventures/The_Seven_Shards_Campaign/Pregenerated_Characters.md|Pregens]].

## Battle Maps
- Location list and map briefs in [[01_Adventures/The_Seven_Shards_Campaign/Battle_Maps.md|Battle Maps]].

## Contingencies
- If the party bypasses a guardian: trigger a local anomaly and offer parley clocks.
- If a shard is destroyed: shift the Narrative Web to alternative routes and fallout scenes.
