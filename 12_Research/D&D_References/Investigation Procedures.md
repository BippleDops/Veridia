# Investigation Procedures

*"Truth flows like the deep currents - follow the proper channels, and even the darkest secrets surface." - Spymaster Crow*

## Overview
Investigation procedures in Aquabyssos follow a complex web of formal protocols, shadow networks, and ancient traditions adapted to underwater society. The multi-layered nature of the city creates unique challenges for gathering information, requiring specialized techniques for different depth levels and social strata. These procedures have evolved to account for the three-dimensional nature of underwater cities, the presence of multiple intelligent species, and the constant threat of pressure-related complications.

The formal investigation system operates through the Pearl Guard's Detective Division, while informal networks span from the Shadow Warren's intelligence operations to merchant guild information brokers. Each system has developed its own methods for handling evidence preservation in aquatic environments, witness protection across vast vertical territories, and the unique challenges of pursuing leads through both inhabited districts and the dangerous depths beyond city limits.

## Historical Context
### Origins
The earliest investigation procedures in Aquabyssos emerged from ancient Merfolk traditions of truth-seeking through echolocation-based interrogation techniques. These methods relied on the ability to detect physiological changes in subjects through sound waves, creating a natural form of truth detection that predated magical means. As the city grew to accommodate multiple species, these techniques were adapted and formalized into protocols that could work across different physiologies.

The integration of Surface dwellers brought new concepts of evidence collection and witness testimony, while the unique challenges of underwater crime scenes required innovative preservation methods. Early investigators developed specialized containers using magical preservation spells and pressure-resistant materials to maintain evidence integrity across different depth zones.

### Development
During the Great Unification period, investigation procedures became standardized across all districts of Aquabyssos. The Pearl Guard established the Detective Division, creating formal ranks and procedures that combined the best practices from all constituent species. This period saw the development of the evidence preservation protocols still used today, including the use of crystal matrices to store sensory memories and pressure-sealed evidence chambers.

The Shadow Warren's influence during this time led to the parallel development of covert investigation techniques, creating a shadow system that operates alongside official procedures. These methods focus on information gathering through social networks, economic pressure, and the exploitation of the city's complex political relationships.

### Current Era
Modern investigation procedures in Aquabyssos represent a sophisticated blend of traditional techniques, magical enhancement, and adaptation to contemporary threats. The rise of the Silverscale Conspiracy and increasing Surface tensions have driven innovations in counter-intelligence and deep-cover operations. Current procedures must account for threats ranging from political assassination to reality-altering magical phenomena.

The introduction of crystal corruption as a investigative complication has led to specialized protocols for handling contaminated evidence and witnesses. Investigation teams now require regular screening for corruption exposure, and specialized containment procedures for corruption-related crimes.

## Cultural Significance
### In Aquabyssos
Investigation procedures reflect the city's values of community protection and collective responsibility. The concept of "current-truth" - information that flows naturally through social networks - is considered as valuable as formal evidence. Citizens are expected to cooperate with investigations as part of their civic duty, though the multi-layered society creates complex loyalties that investigators must navigate carefully.

The vertical nature of the city has created distinct investigation cultures at different depth levels. Upper district investigations tend to be more formal and politically sensitive, while deeper investigations may rely more heavily on traditional methods and community knowledge.

### In Aethermoor
Surface dwellers initially found Aquabyssos investigation procedures overly complex and intrusive, particularly the use of magical truth detection and the expectation of community involvement. However, as relations have improved, many Surface investigators have adopted underwater evidence preservation techniques for their own challenging environments.

The exchange of investigation techniques has been one of the most successful areas of inter-world cooperation, with joint training programs producing investigators capable of working in both environments.

## Mechanical Implementation
### Core Mechanics
- Investigation checks gain advantage when following proper procedures
- Pressure-adapted evidence preservation prevents degradation across depth zones
- Truth detection protocols provide insight bonuses when culturally appropriate
- Network investigation allows information gathering across multiple social layers

### Requirements
- Formal investigations require Pearl Guard authorization or equivalent jurisdiction
- Pressure adaptation equipment for multi-depth investigations
- Cultural liaison for investigations involving multiple species
- Magical detection prevention for corruption-related cases

### Effects
- Proper procedure following grants +2 bonus to Investigation checks
- Evidence preserved correctly maintains integrity for magical analysis
- Network investigations can reveal information unavailable through formal channels
- Corruption screening prevents investigator contamination

## Notable Events
### The Tidecrest Incident
A breakthrough case where proper procedure allowed investigators to solve a murder that occurred across three different depth zones, establishing precedent for complex multi-environment crimes.

### Shadow Warren Infiltration
The discovery that investigation procedures had been compromised by Shadow Warren operatives led to a complete overhaul of security protocols and the development of counter-intelligence measures.

## Key Figures
- **Detective Captain Marlowe Tidecrest**: Pioneer of multi-depth investigation techniques
- **Spymaster Crow**: Developer of shadow investigation networks
- **Archivist Vera Glowmind**: Creator of magical evidence preservation systems
- **Commander Drake Pressureborn**: Oversight of corruption-related investigation protocols

## Current Developments
The recent increase in crystal corruption cases has prompted development of specialized investigation teams with enhanced protective equipment. New procedures are being developed for investigating reality-altering crimes where traditional evidence may be unreliable or dangerous to examine.

The growing cooperation with Surface authorities has led to joint investigation protocols for crimes that span both worlds, requiring new diplomatic and procedural frameworks.
