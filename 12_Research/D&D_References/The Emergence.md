## Overview
The Emergence refers to a prophesied event when hidden or dormant aspects of underwater civilization will "emerge" into prominence. Different groups interpret this prophecy various ways, from literal creatures rising from deep trenches to metaphorical social transformations.

## Prophetic Interpretations
**Literal Emergence:** Ancient creatures or civilizations rising from ocean depths
**Social Emergence:** Marginalized groups gaining political power and recognition
**Magical Emergence:** Dormant magical energies awakening in the population
**Technological Emergence:** Revolutionary innovations transforming society
**Spiritual Emergence:** Mass enlightenment or religious awakening

## Believers and Skeptics
**The Emergence Cult:** Fanatic believers preparing for transformation
**Academic Scholars:** Studying historical precedents and evidence
**Government Observers:** Monitoring for potential social disruption
**Religious Orders:** Incorporating prophecy into theological frameworks
**Skeptical Scientists:** Dismissing as coincidence and wishful thinking

## Preparation Activities
**Resource Hoarding:** Groups stockpiling supplies for uncertain future
**Skill Development:** Training in abilities deemed important post-Emergence
**Alliance Building:** Forming coalitions to weather expected changes
