# Kiss of Torment (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
You must touch a creatureâ€™s bare flesh, either literally kissing the creature or brushing it with your fingertips. That creature may make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. On a failure, the creature takes 4d6 psychic damage and is in so much pain that it is incapacitated for the duration. It may make a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending that effect on a success. However, each round that the creature remains incapacitated, it takes an addi-tional 2d6 psychic damage.
