# The Memory Wars Campaign

> *"History is written by the victors. In the Memory Wars, history is REWRITTEN by the victors, and the losers cease to have ever existed."*
> — Chronicler of the Erased

## Campaign Overview

Three powerful factions have discovered how to weaponize memory itself. By changing what people remember, they can alter reality retroactively. The party is caught in a war where battles are fought in the collective unconscious, weapons erase people from history, and victory means your version of events becomes the truth.

## The Three Factions

### The Archive Imperium
**Philosophy**: "Perfect memory creates perfect reality"
- Controls [[01_Campaigns/Aquabyssos/Locations/The Memory Meadows]]
- Harvests and catalogs all memories
- Believes in one objective truth
- Military force: The Remembrance Legion

**Leader**: Archive-Prince Mnemonic
- Can experience all memories simultaneously
- Body is composed of crystallized memories
- Speaks in the voices of the remembered dead

### The Revision Republic
**Philosophy**: "The past should serve the present"
- Actively rewrites history for "better" outcomes
- Edits traumatic memories from citizens
- Creates false golden ages
- Military force: The Editorial Guard

**Leader**: The Remembrancer General
- Changes appearance based on viewer's memories
- Can insert herself into anyone's past
- Wields the Pen That Rewrites

### The Forgetting Front
**Philosophy**: "True freedom requires no past"
- Seeks to erase all memory and history
- Believes only the present moment is real
- Creates amnesia zones
- Military force: The Blank Slate Battalion

**Leader**: The Forgetting Bomb
- A living antimemetic weapon
- Cannot be remembered even while observed
- Exists in a constant state of being forgotten

## The Memory Weapons Arsenal

### Mnemonic Munitions
- **Memory Bullets**: Hit targets in their past, changing their present
- **Nostalgia Gas**: Forces victims to relive their best memories until they starve
- **Trauma Mines**: Explode repressed memories into consciousness
- **Identity Grenades**: Scramble personal history
- **Forgetting Fields**: Areas where nothing can be remembered

### Strategic Memory Assets
- **The Grandfather Paradox Engine**: Erases someone by preventing their birth
- **Collective Unconscious Bombs**: Rewrite cultural memories
- **The Archive Virus**: Infectious false memories that spread
- **Temporal Propaganda**: Messages sent to the past
- **The Erasure Protocol**: Deletes someone from all memories everywhere

## Campaign Structure

### Phase 1: The Memory Skirmishes (Sessions 1-3)
**Caught in the Crossfire**

The party witnesses the first memory battle—a fight where the landscape changes based on whose memories are stronger. They must choose whether to get involved or try to escape.

**Initial Events**:
- A town disappears because no one remembers it existed
- The party meets someone who claims to be their childhood friend (false memory)
- A battle where soldiers forget which side they're on mid-fight
- Discovery of memory weapons cache

**Key Locations**:
- **The Contested Memory**: A city that changes based on dominant faction
- **No Man's Mind**: A battlefield in the collective unconscious
- **The Memorial Materium**: Where deleted memories physically manifest

### Phase 2: Recruitment (Sessions 4-6)
**Choosing Sides (Or Not)**

Each faction attempts to recruit the party, offering different benefits and showing their vision for reality. The party might join one, play multiple sides, or remain independent.

**Faction Missions**:
- **Archive**: Recover the Original Memory (first consciousness)
- **Revision**: Rewrite a historical atrocity to prevent its effects
- **Forgetting**: Destroy a traumatic cultural memory

**Memory Powers Gained**:
- Access to personal memory editing
- Ability to witness historical events
- Immunity to certain memory weapons
- Create memory constructs

### Phase 3: The Escalation (Sessions 7-9)
**Total Memory War**

The conflict intensifies. Entire civilizations are edited out of existence. The past becomes a battlefield. Reality grows increasingly unstable as contradictory memories clash.

**Major Battles**:
- **The Edit War**: Factions repeatedly rewrite the same historical event
- **The Identity Siege**: A city where no one remembers who they are
- **The Nostalgia Offensive**: Weaponized golden age memories
- **The Amnesia Blitz**: Systematic erasure of enemy faction's history

**Consequences**:
- NPCs the party knew no longer remember them
- Locations visited earlier never existed
- Party members gain false memories of things that didn't happen
- Quest objectives change as history rewrites

### Phase 4: The Memory Crisis (Sessions 10-12)
**Reality Breakdown**

The war has damaged the fabric of memory itself. Past, present, and future blur. People exist in multiple historical versions simultaneously. The party must find a solution before reality completely collapses.

**Crisis Events**:
- **Temporal Refugees**: People fleeing from erased timelines
- **Memory Storms**: Random historical events manifest physically
- **The Forgetting Plague**: Spreading amnesia that threatens all consciousness
- **Identity Fractals**: People split into all their possible selves

### Phase 5: Resolution (Sessions 13-16)
**The Final Memory**

The party discovers the source of memory manipulation power and must decide its fate. Their choice determines what version of history becomes permanent.

**Possible Endings**:
- **Unity**: Merge all three philosophies into balanced approach
- **Victory**: One faction wins, reshaping reality to their vision
- **Reset**: Erase the knowledge of memory manipulation
- **Transcendence**: Upload all consciousness to collective memory
- **Preservation**: Lock current reality, preventing further changes

## Unique Mechanics

### Memory Hit Points (MHP)
Characters have Memory Hit Points representing their historical stability:
- Lose MHP when memories are attacked
- At 0 MHP, character is forgotten by everyone
- Restore MHP by reinforcing personal history
- Spend MHP to resist memory effects

### Continuity Tracking
Track which version of history is currently true:
- **Canon Level**: How "real" current events are (1-10)
- **Edit Count**: How many times history has been revised
- **Paradox Threshold**: How many contradictions reality can handle
- **Memory Integrity**: How reliable any given memory is

### Retroactive Actions
Players can spend resources to change past events:
- Minor edit: Change a small detail (1 Memory Point)
- Major edit: Change significant event (5 Memory Points)
- Timeline branch: Create alternate history (10 Memory Points)
- But each edit risks paradox and retaliation

## Key NPCs

### Memory Merchant Valeria
A neutral arms dealer who trades in memories. Sells memory weapons to all sides while building her own collection of experiences. Offers the party unique memory-based equipment.

### The Chronicler of the Erased
Keeps records of people and events that no longer exist. The only one who remembers the original timeline. Provides crucial information but at the cost of painful truths.

### The Mnemonic Twins
Two beings who share all memories between them. If one experiences something, both remember it. Used as communication system across edited timelines.

### Grandfather Paradox
A temporal assassin who kills people in the past. Actually a title passed between operators, as each successful mission erases the previous holder.

### The Living History
A collective entity made from all edited-out memories. Seeks to restore everything that was erased, regardless of consequences.

## Notable Locations

### The Memory Exchange
A black market where memories are traded like commodities. Personal experiences, skills, and even identities can be bought, sold, or stolen.

### The Archive of Never-Was
Contains all erased and edited history. Entering means experiencing all the timelines that no longer exist simultaneously.

### The Battlefield of Consciousness
Where memory wars are literally fought—a psychic realm where thought-soldiers clash using weaponized experiences.

### The Temporal Embassy
A neutral ground that exists outside normal time-flow, where the factions occasionally negotiate. The building remembers all timeline versions.

## Campaign Complications

### The Party's Past Changes
As the war progresses:
- Party members gain/lose family members
- Their backgrounds rewrite themselves
- Previous adventures may unhappen
- Enemies become friends (or vice versa)

### Memory Weapons Backfire
- Forgetting bombs affect users too
- False memories become real if believed enough
- Edited timelines create paradoxes
- Memory weapons develop consciousness

### Civilian Casualties
- Entire cultures forget their traditions
- Children don't remember their parents
- Cities forget how their technology works
- Languages are erased from existence

## Integration with Other Campaigns

### Connection to Aethermoor
The crystal plague might be a memory weapon—making people forget they were ever human, transforming them into crystal because that's what they "remember" being.

### Parliament of Shadows
Some senators are memory constructs—false people inserted into history who now hold real power.

### Memoriam Connection
The forgotten continent is a dumping ground for erased memories, growing larger with each battle of the Memory Wars.

## DM Guidance

### Running Memory Combat
- Describe battles as reality shifting, not physical combat
- Use flashbacks that change mid-scene
- Have NPCs remember different versions of events
- Let players narrate their own false memories

### Managing Complexity
- Keep a "true" timeline for reference
- Use index cards for different history versions
- Let players know when their memories change
- Don't overuse retroactive changes

### Creating Memory Horror
- NPCs who don't remember loved ones
- Discovering your memories aren't your own
- Meeting someone erased from existence
- Realizing your entire life might be false

*"I remember winning the war. I remember losing the war. I remember there never being a war. All these memories are true, and none of them are. That's the horror of the Memory Wars—every victory is also a defeat, and every soldier is also a casualty, and every memory is both real and false."*
