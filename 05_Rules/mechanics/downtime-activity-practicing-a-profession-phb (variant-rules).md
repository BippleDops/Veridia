--- # Downtime Activity: Practicing a Profession

*Source: Player's Handbook p. 187* You can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day (see chapter 5 for more information on lifestyle expenses). This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession. If you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves' guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead. If you have proficiency in the [[skills#Performance|Performance]] skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Downtime activity practicing a profession phb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
