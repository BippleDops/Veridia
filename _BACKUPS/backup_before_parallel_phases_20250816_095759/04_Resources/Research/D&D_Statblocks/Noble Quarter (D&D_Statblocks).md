> The Noble Quarter's coral plateau is actually a massive living organism that has developed sentience over centuries of magical enhancement. This ancient entity, known only to the eldest members of the founding families, occasionally influences events to maintain the balance of power. It can subtly alter building layouts, create or seal passages, and even influence the emotional states of residents. The creature feeds on the complex social emotions generated by noble intrigue - ambition, jealousy, satisfaction, fear - and has developed an addiction to the dramatic political conflicts. It will sometimes manipulate events to create more interesting power struggles, viewing the noble families as pieces in an elaborate game of its own devising. --- **Related Locations**: - [[Port Meridian - [Abyssos Prime]] - [[Harbor District - [Royal Palace]] - [[Pressure Terminal **Related NPCs**: - [Duchess Cordelia Pearlheart]] - [[The Seven Founding Houses - [Noble Council]] - [[House Guard Captains **Related Items and Concepts**: - [Noble Titles and Ranks]] - [[The Noble Compact - [Living Coral Architecture]] - [[Political Alliances]] ## Player-Facing Summary Noble Quarter is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
