# Healer
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 201*  

You gain the following benefits.

**Battle Medic.** If you have a Healer's Kit, you can expend one use of it and tend to a creature within 5 feet of yourself as a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action. That creature can expend one of its Hit Point Dice, and you then roll that die. The creature regains a number of Hit Points equal to the roll plus your Proficiency Bonus.

**Healing Rerolls.** Whenever you roll a die to determine the number of Hit Points you restore with a spell or with this feat's Battle Medic benefit, you can reroll the die if it rolls a 1, and you must use the new roll.
