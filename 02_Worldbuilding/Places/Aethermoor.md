# Aethermoor
*The Shattered Crown Continent*

## Overview
Aethermoor is a continent forever changed by the Great Crystallization, an event 500 years ago when massive spires of crystallized magic erupted from the earth. These Aether Crystals grant incredible magical power but come with a terrible price - prolonged exposure causes crystalline corruption, slowly transforming living beings into crystal themselves.

## Geography

- **[[Lumengarde]]** - Central kingdom, center of crystal technology

- **[[The Azure Coast]]** - Western trading ports and naval power
- **[[The Whispering Expanse]]** - Mysterious desert where crystals sing
- **[[The Shadowmere]]** - Corrupted swamplands in the southeast

## History

### The Three Epochs

#### The Age of the Crown (Before Great Crystallization)
When the God-King Aetheron ruled with the Crown of Stars, maintaining perfect order through divine mandate.

#### The Shattering (500 years ago)
[[The Great Crystallization]] - Aetheron was betrayed by his seven advisors. The Crown of Stars shattered, its fragments piercing the earth and emerging as Aether Crystals. This event is detailed in [[The Shattering of the Crown]].

#### The Crystal Age (Present)
Five centuries of adaptation to crystal magic. The rise of the [[Crystal Wardens]], the [[Purist Coalition]], and other factions vying for control.
