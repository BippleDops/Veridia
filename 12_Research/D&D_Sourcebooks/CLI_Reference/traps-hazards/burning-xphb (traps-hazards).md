# Burning
*Generic Hazard*  

A burning creature or object takes `d4` Fire damage at the start of each of its turns. As an action, you can extinguish fire on yourself by giving yourself the [[conditions#prone|Prone]] condition and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
