## Special Traits
***Spellcasting.*** The kuo-toa is a 2nd-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks). The kuo-toa has the following cleric spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): *sacred flame, thaumaturgy*
1st level (3 slots): *bane, shield of faith*

***Amphibious.*** The kuo-toa can breathe air and water.

***Otherworldly Perception.*** The kuo-toa can sense the presence of any creature within 30 feet of it that is invisible or on the Ethereal Plane. It can pinpoint such a creature that is moving.

***Slippery.*** The kuo-toa has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the kuo-toa has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The kuo-toa makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its pincer staff.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (`dice: 1d4+2`) piercing damage.
