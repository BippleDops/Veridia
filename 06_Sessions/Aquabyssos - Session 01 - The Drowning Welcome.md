The party arrives in Aquabyssos via [[Pressure Tube, experiencing molecular liquification and reconstitution. Upon arrival at the [Inverse Palace]], they witness [[Senator Hadrian dissolve into living shadow during a Parliament session. Their own shadows begin showing signs of independence as they settle into their inverted quarters. ### [Opening Scene]]

**Location:** [[[Abyssos Prime]]
**Time:** Midday (though sunlight doesn't reach here)
**Description:** The party materializes from liquid form in the [[Pressure Terminal's reconstitution chambers. One member's shadow reforms a second late, moving independently for just a moment. Terminal guards check "molecular integrity" while making notes about shadow irregularities. Graffiti in Aquabyssos script on the walls reads: "[The Harvest]] Comes." > **[[Read Aloud:** "Your consciousness snaps back like a rubber band as your body reconstitutes from liquid. The sensation is wrong—like being poured into a mold that doesn't quite fit. As you solidify, you notice your shadow on the curved glass wall. For just a moment, it waves while your hand remains still." #### Event 1: [The Emperor]]'s Court

**Location:** [[Throne of Bubbles
**NPCs:** [[[The Scattered]] Emperor]], [[[[Marina Red [Tide Coralheart]] - Aquabyssos (D&D_References)]]
**[[Pressure Check:** **DC 12** CON save or gain 1 exhaustion
**Outcome:** - Emperor speaks through electric eel collective
- Each eel contains personality fragment
- Warning about shadows: "Trust nothing that casts shadows"
- Marina introduced as adapted guide
- Bubbles containing last breaths reveal shadow murders **Emperor's [Fragmented Dialogue]]:**
- Eel 1: "We—"
- Eel 2: "—welcome—"
- Eel 3: "—you but—"
- Eel 4: "—trust nothing—"
- Eel 5: "—that casts—"
- Eel 6: "—shadows." #### Event 2: [[The Dissolution

**Location:** [[Parliament of Echoes - [Public Gallery]]]]
**NPCs:** [[[Senator Glaucus]], dissolving [[Senator Hadrian
**[Witness Horror]]:** **DC 13** WIS save or frightened for 1 minute
**Outcome:**
- [[Senator Hadrian screams and melts into living shadow
- Shadow attacks other senators before escaping
- [Senator Glaucus]] laughs inappropriately
- Other senators seem unsurprised by timing
- Party's shadows twitch during event **[[Investigation Clues:**
- Shadow left behind senator's skin like shed clothes
- Glaucus's shadow makes different gestures than him
- Three senators carefully avoid looking at shadows
- Guards at [Shadow Checkpoint]] were absent #### Event 3: [[Quarters Assignment

**Location:** [[[Inverted Ballroom]] Wing]]
**Investigation DC:** 15 to find previous ambassador's journal
**[[Shadow Check:** **DC 10** WIS to notice shadow irregularities
**Outcome:**
- Rooms have inverted gravity (walk on ceiling)
- Previous ambassador's journal: "I am no longer casting it"
- Mirrors show shadows performing different actions
- Evidence someone entered rooms before arrival
- Waterfalls flow upward into ceiling pools ### [Closing Scene]]

**Location:** [[[[Inverted Ballroom Wing - [Party Quarters]]]]
**Time:** Night cycle (artificial darkness)
**Cliffhanger:** Party members wake to find their shadows standing at the foot of their beds, perfectly still, watching them. One shadow holds a knife. Marina bursts in: "Don't move. Don't even breathe. If you acknowledge them, they become real." Through the window, dozens of shadows dance in the [[Inverted Ballroom without their owners. ### [Environmental Challenges]]
