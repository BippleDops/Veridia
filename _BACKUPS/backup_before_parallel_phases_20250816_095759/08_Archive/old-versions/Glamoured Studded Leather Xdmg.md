*Light armor ([[studded-leather-armor-xphb (items)), rare* - **Armor Class**: 12 + Dex modifier
- **Weight**: 13.0 lbs. While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to [armor-class-xphb (variant-rules)]]. You can also take a [[Action Xphb to cause the armor to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of armor. You decide what it looks likeâ€”including color, style, and accessoriesâ€”but the armor retains its normal bulk and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or doff the armor. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 264.
