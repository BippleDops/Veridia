## Description
With this handy contraption, bards can soar through the air with the birds. By having a hefty bard (or two) leap from a height onto the short end of the lever, a bard standing upon the long end can be propelled to great heights or distances. The fulcrum is lightweight and thus easily carried, and can be used with the provided lever or another sturdy board.

## Additional Details
requires 1 day of practice; doubles height or length attained through Jumping proficiency (with running start) up to 3 times PC’s height vertically or 12 times PC’s height horizontally
