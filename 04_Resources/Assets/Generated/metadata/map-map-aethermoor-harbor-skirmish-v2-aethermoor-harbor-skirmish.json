  "revised_prompt": "Render a tactical map of a fantastical harbor named Aethermoor, presented from a top-down perspective in a style reminiscent of a rich, painterly medieval fantasy. The 15x15 grid should be 140 px per square, totaling a map size of 2100x2100 px, and should clearly portray different terrain types - passable, impassable, and places with difficult terrain. Please incorporate signs of weathering such as collapses, rips, and currents with clarity. Ensure the map provides multiple routes and strategic options, including features like ramps, stairs, ledges, and contour lines. Embellish walls and obstacles with bold lines, while using fine lines to represent textures. The grid should be high-contrast yet crisply rendered. The palette should incorporate shades of navy, gold, and cloud-white, complemented by warm sun highlights. It's a fantastical world that draws inspiration from grounded medieval materials, featuring culturally coherent gear and devoid of any modern tech or sci-fi UIs. The aesthetic should lean towards a blend of wind-swept forms and airship motifs, evoking a sense of skyward romantic realism. Lastly, this map should be ready for Virtual Tabletop (VTT) use - void of embedded text labels, stylized fonts, and garbled symbols, reserving clean margins and text-safe areas for overlays. Instead, icons and clear linework should be used to denote features, with a focus on avoiding random letter strings and modern signage.",
