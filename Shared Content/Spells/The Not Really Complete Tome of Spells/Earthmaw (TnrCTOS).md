## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a tooth from a carni-vore)

## Effects
A 10-foot wide maw on a short, serpentine neck springs out of the ground at attacks one creature within 10 feet of it. It uses your spell attack modifier to attack. On a hit, it does 6d6 piercing damage and swallows the creature, if it Large-sized or smaller. Then it sinks back into the ground and vanishes, leaving the creature it swallowed trapped in the ground.

While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained and takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage each round until the spell ends or it is freed from the outside. The creature also has no air and must hold its breath.
