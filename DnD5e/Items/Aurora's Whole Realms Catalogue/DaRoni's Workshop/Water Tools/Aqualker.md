## Description
Believe it or not, there are spiders who can walk on the water. I saw this and thought how to make me walk on the water like does a spider. So I made my Aqualker, with these cone-shaped pads for the feet and rods for the hands with pads at the bottom. Lets you not sink. Works better for light people. You better not use it in rivers or oceans. 8 gp
