## Description
Never out of style. Whether adventuring in dank dungeons or attending a fine Waterdhavian affair, a good pair of hose is indispensable. Our comfortable collection ranges from durable wool and comfortable linen (for those who require sturdy leg-wear) to silk and velvet (at double the price).
