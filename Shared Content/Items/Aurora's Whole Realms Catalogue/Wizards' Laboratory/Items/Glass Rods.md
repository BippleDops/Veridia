## Description
Though some mages still insist upon using wooden stirring rods (which sometimes flake into solutions and always absorb liquids they contact), glass stirring rods have become essential to accurate admixing. We offer small rods (3 sp) for stirring vial-sized mixtures, medium-length rods (4 sp) for stirring even large [[Beakers|beakers]], and large, thick rods (8 sp) for stirring containers up to cauldron-size.

## Additional Details
6 small, 6 medium, and 2 large rods are needed for a complete laboratory
