Understanding these invisible battles is essential for navigating the complex web of commerce, politics, and power that determines the fate of both realms. ## Lore Details Ancient scholars speak of the First Ledger, a mythical accounting book that records every transaction, debt, and economic obligation across all realities. Some believe that those who master economic warfare have learned to read portions of this cosmic ledger, gaining insight into the hidden connections that bind all economic activity. Deep-sea explorers report discovering ruins of ancient civilizations that apparently destroyed themselves through economic warfare so sophisticated it transcended traditional concepts of victory and defeat. These ruins suggest that economic warfare may be a fundamental force of existence, as inevitable and powerful as gravity or magic itself. ## DM Notes Economic warfare provides a framework for sophisticated political intrigue that goes beyond simple combat encounters. Use it to create complex scenarios where player actions have far-reaching consequences, where moral choices aren't clear-cut, and where the true scope of conflicts extends far beyond what's immediately visible. Consider how economic warfare affects the daily lives of ordinary people, creating opportunities for characters to see the human cost of abstract ficial conflicts. This can drive character development and provide motivation for characters to become involved in larger political and economic struggles. The invisible nature of economic warfare allows for subtle, long-term campaign development where the consequences of early adventures continue to influence later events in unexpected ways. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - An heirloom has gone missing and war looms
