# Death Tyrant

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing a death tyrant's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Negative Energy Suffusion.** Whenever a creature within 1 mile of the lair regains [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] from a spell, it subtracts `d10` from the number of [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] regained.  
- **Scopophobia.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair feel as if they're being watched. Any creature (excluding the death tyrant and its allies) that finishes a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb|Short Rest]] while within 1 mile of the lair must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain no benefit from that rest.  

If the death tyrant dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
