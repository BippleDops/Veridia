--- # Gentle Repose

*2nd-level, Necromancy (ritual)* - **Casting time:** 1 Action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (2 Copper Pieces, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 10 days You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected from decay and can't become Undead. The spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this spell don't count against the time limit of spells such as [[raise-dead-xphb (spells). **Classes**: [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 278.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of gentle repose xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around gentle repose xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
