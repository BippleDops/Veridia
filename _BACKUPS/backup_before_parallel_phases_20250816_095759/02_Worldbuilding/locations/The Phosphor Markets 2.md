# The Phosphor Markets - The Glowing Bazaar

## Overview
The Phosphor Markets are a massive floating collection of bioluminescent platforms, ships, and structures that drift through the Gloom Gardens, never staying in one location for more than a week. This mobile marketplace is the economic heart of Aquabyssos World Overview, where all factions trade despite political tensions. The market's neutrality is enforced by the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Merchant's Covenant, a powerful trading guild that predates the drowning.

## Market Sections

### The Central Exchange
Massive platform made from a hollowed-out whale corpse, preserved and reinforced with magic. [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Market Master Cornelius Driftwood]] oversees all major trades from his office in what was once the creature's heart.

Living market stalls made from cultivated bioluminescent coral and kelp. [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Merchant Delilah Currentrunner coordinates vendors selling biological goods from [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Lumengarde]].

## DM Guidance & Tips

### Running Market Encounters
**Atmosphere Creation**:
- Emphasize the constant motion and pressure changes
- Use sensory details: bioluminescent lighting, pressure in ears, water currents
- Create a sense of organized chaos with multiple activities happening simultaneously
- Highlight the diversity of creatures and cultures interacting peacefully

### Social Encounters
**Negotiation Guidelines**:
- All major trades require at least three parties: buyer, seller, and witness
- Cultural differences affect trading styles (direct vs. ritualistic)
- Reputation matters more than immediate payment in many cases
- Information is often as valuable as physical goods

### Combat Considerations
**Environmental Factors**:
- Three-dimensional movement through water affects positioning
- Pressure weapons are more dangerous in confined spaces
- Bioluminescent creatures can be blinded by bright light sources
- Sound travels differently underwater, affecting communication spells

### Economic Integration
**Campaign Economy**:
- Use the markets to introduce rare items and plot-relevant materials
- Fluctuating prices can drive adventure motivation
- Market connections provide information network for players
- Economic warfare can create non-violent conflict scenarios

### Scaling for Different Levels
**Low Level (1-5)**: Focus on simple trading, minor disputes, and cultural learning
**Mid Level (6-10)**: Involve complex negotiations, market manipulation, and factional politics
**High Level (11-15)**: Deal with market-wide crises, international trade wars, and economic espionage
**Epic Level (16-20)**: Handle reality-bending economics, divine intervention, and multidimensional commerce

## Environmental Hazards & Challenges

### Pressure Fluctuations
The market's constant movement creates dangerous pressure variations:
- **Sudden Drops**: **DC 15** Constitution save or take `dice: 1d6` bludgeoning damage from rapid decompression
- **Pressure Spikes**: Equipment malfunction on natural 1s during high-pressure zones
- **Adaptation Required**: Non-aquatic creatures need magical assistance or suffer exhaustion

### Depth Hazards
**The Deep Dive**: Lower market levels experience crushing pressure:
- 1000-1500 feet: **DC 12** Constitution saves every hour
- 1500-2000 feet: **DC 16** Constitution saves every 30 minutes
- 2000+ feet: **DC 20** Constitution saves every 10 minutes

### Temporal Market Phenomena
**The Time Tides**: Certain market sections exist in accelerated or slowed time:
- **Fast Zones**: Auctions happen at 3x normal speed
- **Slow Zones**: Perfect for delicate negotiations
