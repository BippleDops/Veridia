# Light
*cantrip, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, M (a firefly or phosphorescent moss)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch one Large or smaller object that isn't being worn or carried by someone else. Until the spell ends, the object sheds [[bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]] in a 20-foot radius and [[dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like.

Covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again.

## Player-Facing Summary

Light xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of light xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around light xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties light xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at light xphb to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to light xphb active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
