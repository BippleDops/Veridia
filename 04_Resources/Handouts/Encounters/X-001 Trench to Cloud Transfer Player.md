# Trench-to-Cloud Transfer

Water peels away as sky rushes in. Your sub grows light and quick as the storm takes it by the wings.

What you notice
- Ballast singing
- Wind where there was pressure

What you can try
- Hold steady while systems switch
- Watch the gauges
- Brace for a jolt

Possible outcomes
- A clean leap into the sky
- A rough jolt and a wide turn
- A spin that needs quick hands
