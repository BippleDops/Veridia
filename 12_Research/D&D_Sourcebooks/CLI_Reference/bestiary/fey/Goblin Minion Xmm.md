*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 142. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* Goblin minions enjoy participating in the disruptive schemes of clever leaders but are quick to flee when confronted by their comeuppance. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Goblins *Wild Tricksters and Troublemakers* - **Habitat.** Forest, Grassland, Hill, Planar (Acheron), Planar (Feywild), Underdark - **Treasure.** Implements, Individual Goblins are Feywild embodiments of recklessness and ruin. They delight in wreckageâ€”the louder, the more energetic, and the more convoluted, the better. Goblin raids are often as much opportunities to enjoy setting fires and tormenting livestock as they are parts of more disruptive plots. Goblins obey those who accomplish the wildest plans. Such leaders might be goblin raid masterminds, bombastic magic-users, or those capable of making the loudest noises. Hobgoblins and forceful humanoids might also command ornery groups of goblins, directing their destructiveness toward banditry, sabotage, or war. The deity Maglubiyet claims to be the god of goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears, and on the Infinite Battlefield of Acheron, the deity commands innumerable goblinoid legions. In ages long past, Maglubiyet witnessed the destructive propensity of goblinoids and relocated a population of them from the Feywild to his realm on the Outer Planes. Since then, hordes of these more martial-minded goblins have flourished, with some finding their ways to Material Plane worlds. These vicious invaders seek to sow ruin in preparation for their god's conquest. > [!quote] A quote from Approximate translation from Goblin to Common: "Hey, rube!" > > Bree-yark!```statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of goblin minion xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around goblin minion xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[goblin-minion-xmm (fey)]]
