# Hurl Rock (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a tiny pebble)

**Duration**: 1 round


## Effects
You telekinetically hurl a loose rock that is within 10 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, it inflicts bludgeoning damage depending on the rockâ€™s size:

<div>

| **Diameter** | **Damage** |
|---|---|
| Up to 1 foot | 2d4 |
| 1-2 feet | 2d6 |
| 2-3 feet | 2d8 |
| 3-4 feet | 2d10 |
| 4-5 feet | 3d8 |
| 5-6 feet | 4d10 |

</div>

If the rock strikes something hard, there is a 50% chance it will shatter into shrapnel. All creatures within 10 feet of the impact must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.
