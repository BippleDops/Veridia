# Fade Away
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 74*  

**Prerequisite**: [Gnome](/03_Mechanics/CLI/races/gnome-xphb.md)

Your people are clever, with a knack for illusion magic. You have learned a magical trick for fading away when you suffer harm. You gain the following benefits:

- Increase your Dexterity or Intelligence by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
- Immediately after you take damage, you can use a reaction to magically become [invisible](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Invisible) until the end of your next turn or until you attack, deal damage, or force someone to make a saving throw. Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
