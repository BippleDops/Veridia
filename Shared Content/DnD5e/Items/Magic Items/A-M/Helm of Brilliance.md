## Description
This dazzling helm is set with `dice: 1d10` (1d10) diamonds, `dice: 2d10` (2d10) rubies, `dice: 3d10` (3d10) fire opals, and `dice: 4d10` (4d10) opals. Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.

You gain the following benefits while wearing it:

- You can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 18), using one of the helmâ€™s gems of the specified type as a component: **[[Daylight|daylight]]** (opal), **[[Fireball|fireball]]** (fire opal), **[[Prismatic Spray|prismatic spray]]** (diamond), or **[[Wall of Fire|wall of fire]]** (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.

- As long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits [[9 - The Environment|dim light]] in a 30-foot radius when at least one [[14 - Monsters|undead]] is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes `dice: 1d6` (1d6) [[17 - Damage and Healing|radiant]] damage.

- As long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have [[17 - Damage and Healing|resistance]] to [[17 - Damage and Healing|fire]] damage.

- As long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit [[9 - The Environment|bright light]] in a 10-foot radius and [[9 - The Environment|dim light]] for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra `dice: 1d6` (1d6) [[17 - Damage and Healing|fire]] damage. The flames last until you use a [[12 - The Order of Combat|bonus action]] to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.

Roll a `dice: 1d20` (d20) if you are wearing the helm and take [[17 - Damage and Healing|fire]] damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of [[9 - The Environment|light]] from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 17 [[Dexterity|Dexterity]] saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking [[17 - Damage and Healing|radiant]] damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.
