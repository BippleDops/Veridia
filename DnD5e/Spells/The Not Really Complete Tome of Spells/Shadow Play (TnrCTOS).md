# Shadow Play (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *divination*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a candle)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 3 hours


## Effects
You place a lit candle in the middle of a room that is no larger than 30 feet by 30 feet, and cast this spell. The shadows projected by the candle transform into the shadows of the room’s previous occupants, which them silently act out the events of those creatures. This spell does not replay the actions of undead, constructs, celestials, or fiends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a 6th-level or higher spell slot, the shadows will speak in whispering tones, repeating the words that the room’s previous occupants said.
