## Description
I once saw a king try to get into his castle past a village crowd. They set on him with only tools: scythes, hayforks, flails, cudgels. He wore full plate mail and his horse had full barding. Both died in thirty feet of [[Entering|entering]] the crowd. They cut of his head and put it on the pub sign. I wondered if somebody could be safe going through the crowd.

So I made this armored wagon. You sit under it and turn the cranks on the sides to make the wheels roll. It goes fast on roads or smooth land. Sheds rain. Should still have lots of armored knights with you. Dont let them turn it over. 250 gp.

## Additional Details
Provides AC 0 when upright; moves as top speed of 24; wt 400 lb; requires 25 points of Str to turn over
