--- # Pole of Collapsing

*Wondrous item, common* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/pole-of-collapsing.webp#right) This item functions as a Pole. While holding it, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to collapse it into a 1-foot-long rod for ease of storage (the pole's weight doesn't change) or cause the 1-foot-long rod to revert to a Pole. The rod elongates only as far as the surrounding space allows. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 286* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Pole of collapsing xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
