# Braziers
## Overview
**Price**: 5 gp.

**Weight**: -

A [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Priests' Alcove/Brazier|brazier]] illuminates an area 30 feet in diameter for one hour per bowlful of coals or wood. Higher fires can be built which light a 40 foot area for a briefer time by overloading the bowl, but coals have a 20% chance of falling from the bowl onto the floor per 10 minutes and possibly causing a fire.

These sturdy bronze braziers are composed of two pieces: a tripod of three legs held together by a large [[Ring|ring]], and a bronze bowl. Into the bowl is placed wood or charcoal, which creates the illumination (5 gp).
