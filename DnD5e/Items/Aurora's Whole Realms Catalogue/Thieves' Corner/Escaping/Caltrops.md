## Description
When fleeing from the scene of a crime, one need not rely on skill alone to escape harm’s way. By tossing spikey caltrops onto a rough path or [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Thieves' Corner/Escaping/Marbles|marbles]] on a smooth floor one can markedly slow a pursuit. Aniseed can throw dogs off a thief’s scent, and a field of snap-traps can deter pursuers of any type. When fleeing with a bag of gold beneath one arm, have a bag of spoilers beneath the other and you’ll surely get away.

## Additional Details
Pursuers move at 1/3 speed or save vs. paralyzation; successful save halts movement and does `dice: 1d4` damage
