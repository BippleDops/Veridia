# Trap #35 - "Common Guys Get A Grip!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> Once the party has exhausted all the options of this room without finding the elusive treasure, they will begin to search the walls for doors. On the wall opposite [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] beneath the stucco, as usual, there can be found two doors. The doors are located just beyond the ends of the coffin at either end of the platform.
> 
> Both doors are of the three finger hole type, and once opened present the delver with the same vista. The doors open into the room of the terracotta soldiers, and reveal a 10 foot by 10 foot shaft leading down. There is aladderineach shaft, but it is on the wall opposite the door in each case.
> 
> Let us begin with the door on the right. Clearly to goon will call for a leap of faith. Sure there are ways to laboriously inch a party's way around the walls over to the ladder. Pitons and climbing ropes, and such craven devices come to mind. A more likely delver I.Q. level solution will be to tie a rope to a party member and have him jump over,and grabhold of the ladder. To the party's surprise this will work. It will also set off the trap.
> 
> In a reservoir at the top of the ladder is a tank of thin, and extremely slippery, oil. When the first party member's weight is put upon the ladder it will slip down a fraction of an inch, allowing the oil to run down the sides of the ladder. Very little of the oil will get on the crossties, but close observation will reveal the crossties are set in parellel grooves on the sides of the ladder. The oil will coat the sides very, quickly. Other than glistening in the torch light the oil will seem to have no affect.
> 
> At some point the party will have to continue on down. If they give up on the ladder all together they will need 90 feet of rope to reach the bottom of the shaft. If they trust rhe ladder, they will find, if their initial tester is willing to climb up and down a little, rhat the ladder is perfectly safe and solid for at least the the first 25 feet down, and back up. Hopefully at this point, oily sides notwithstanding, the delvers are likely to give the ladder a try. 
> 
> At a point 55 feet down there is a series of 10 rungs, any one of which will cause the trap to activate. Once weight is brought to bear on one of these rungs a release in the upright sides of rhe ladder is tripped, and all the cross ties are released. As rhey have been thoroughly lubricated, they will slide down the grooves until they reach the bottom of the shaft, 45 to 90 feet below. Efforts to grab hold of the sides of the ladder are largely futile. First because of the lubricant oil, and second because of the falling cross ties. Any grip will necessarily req uire all or part of the delvers han'd to cover the groove. Thump, the first cross tie hits, thump, rhe second, the third, and so foUrth, the chinese water torture has nothing on rhis. Eventually the repeated impacts, or the weight of the mounting crossties (not to mention other members of the party foolish enough to be on the ladder above) will knock even the toughest delver off.
> 
> Eventually the tomb robbers will end up in a heap along with 80 metal crossties at the bottom of the shaft. The shaft and the ladder end 10 feet before the actual floor as the tunnel continues off in that direction.
> 
> This is a three skull trap, fairly lethal. It escapes four skulls by the fact that most delvers will tie themselves off to the top somehow, and thus escape the death plummet. 
> 
> If the party elects to continue on down the tunnel thus discovered return to the portion of the tomb labeled "[[2 - Right Face|RIGHT FACE]]!" and run the traps in reverse order! This corridor will dead end next to the door out of which [[Trap #14 - ''Things Get All Screwed Up._|Trap #14]] "[[Trap #14 - ''Things Get All Screwed Up._|Things Get All Screwed Up]]." emerges.
