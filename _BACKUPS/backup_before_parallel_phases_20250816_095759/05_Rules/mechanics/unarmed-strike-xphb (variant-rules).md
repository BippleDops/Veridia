--- # Unarmed Strike

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 377. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* Instead of using a weapon to make a melee attack, you can use a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow. In game terms, this is an Unarmed Strikeâ€”a melee attack that involves you using your body to damage, grapple, or shove a target within 5 feet of you. Whenever you use your Unarmed Strike, choose one of the following options for its effect. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Damage You make an attack roll against the target. Your bonus to the roll equals your Strength modifier plus your [[Proficiency Xphb. On a hit, the target takes Bludgeoning damage equal to 1 plus your Strength modifier. ## Grapple The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity [Death Saving Throw Xphb]] (it chooses which), or it has the [[conditions#Grappled|Grappled condition. The DC for the [Death Saving Throw Xphb]] and any escape attempts equals 8 plus your Strength modifier and [[Proficiency Xphb. This grapple is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you and if you have a hand free to grab it. ## Shove The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity [Death Saving Throw Xphb]] (it chooses which), or you either push it 5 feet away or cause it to have the [[conditions#prone|Prone condition. The DC for the [Death Saving Throw Xphb]] equals 8 plus your Strength modifier and [[Proficiency Xphb]]. This shove is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you. ## Player-Facing Summary Unarmed strike xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of unarmed strike xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around unarmed strike xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - The authorities needs help delivering before the new moon
