# Arcane Vigor
*2nd-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You tap into your life force to heal yourself. Roll one or two of your unexpended [[hit-point-dice-xphb|Hit Point Dice]], and regain a number of [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] equal to the roll's total plus your spellcasting ability modifier. Those dice are then expended.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The number of unexpended Hit Dice you can roll increases by one for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes**: [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Fighter (Eldritch Knight)]]; [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-abjurer-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Wizard (Abjurer)]]; [[list-spells-classes-sorcerer|Sorcerer]]; [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]; [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Rogue (Arcane Trickster)]]; [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Bard (College of Lore)]]; [[list-spells-classes-wizard|Wizard]]
