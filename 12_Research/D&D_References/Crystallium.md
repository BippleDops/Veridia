## Overview

Crystallium stands as [[Aquabyssos]]'s premier scientific research facility, a gleaming complex of crystal-glass laboratories and pressure chambers built 8,000 feet beneath the surface. Here, [[Master Crystallographer Aurora Prismheart]] leads the [[Crystal Academy Council]] in unlocking the secrets of crystal formation, pressure magic, and the mysterious interaction between [[Aethermoor|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s shattered [[Crown of Stars]] and the deep ocean environment.

The facility serves as both research institute and strategic resource, developing new technologies for [[Aquabyssos]] while maintaining extensive trade relationships with the surface world. Its discoveries have revolutionized underwater construction, deep-pressure medicine, and the understanding of how magic adapts to extreme environments.

*"At Crystallium, we don't just study the depths - we master them, one crystal at a time."*

## Player-Facing Summary

Crystallium is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Crystallium as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Crystallium.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
