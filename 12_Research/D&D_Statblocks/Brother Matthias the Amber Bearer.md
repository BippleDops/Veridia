# Brother Matthias the Amber Bearer
*Unwitting Guardian of the Amber Shard, The Righteous Crusader*

## Overview
Brother Matthias is one of the most zealous and effective members of the [[Purist Coalition|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/Purist Coalition]], known for his unwavering faith and supernatural resilience in battle against crystal corruption. What neither he nor his leader [[High Inquisitor Maltheos|02 Worldbuilding/People/High Inquisitor Maltheos]] realizes is that his legendary endurance and unbreakable will come from the [[The Seven Shards|Amber Shard]] embedded in his chest—a cruel irony that would destroy his worldview if discovered.

## Description

- **The Hidden Mark**: Amber-colored scar over his heart, glows faintly when using Shard powers
- **Bearing**: Radiates confidence and unshakeable conviction

- **Presence**: Commands respect and loyalty from Coalition members

## Background
### The Faithful Soldier

- Lost entire family to crystal plague when he was 16
- Joined early Purist Coalition, rose through ranks through dedication
- Became Maltheos's most trusted lieutenant and enforcer
- Renowned for surviving impossible odds and never breaking under pressure

### The Unknowing Blessing
- Received the "amber blessing" 15 years ago during failed Coalition raid
- Thought dying from crystal shard wound to the chest
- "Miraculous recovery" attributed to divine intervention and pure faith
- Actually, Amber Shard fragment entered his body and bonded with him
- Believes his enhanced abilities come from righteous conviction

## Shard-Enhanced Abilities
### Physical Powers
- **Unbreakable Will**: Immune to fear, charm, and mind control effects
- **Divine Endurance**: Can fight for hours without tiring
- **Damage Resistance**: Shrugs off wounds that would fell normal men
- **Corruption Immunity**: Cannot be affected by crystal corruption
- **Inspiring Presence**: Rallies allies and demoralizes enemies

### Hidden Shard Manifestations
- **Truth Compulsion**: People find it difficult to lie in his presence
- **Righteous Fury**: Battle rage that enhances strength dramatically
- **Purifying Touch**: Can cleanse minor corruptions through physical contact
- **Conviction Field**: Area around him resists illusions and deceptions
- **Shard Sense**: Unconsciously drawn to other Shard locations

## Role in the Purist Coalition
### The Perfect Weapon
- Maltheos's primary enforcer for dangerous missions
- Leads Coalition strike teams against crystal facilities
- Inspirational figure for younger Coalition members
- Living proof that "pure faith" can overcome any corruption
- Symbol of Coalition righteousness and divine favor

### Military Operations
- Commands the "Pure Strike" elite assault unit
- Specializes in destroying crystal refineries and research facilities
- Has personally "purified" dozens of corruption victims
- Plans and executes Coalition's most dangerous operations
- Trains new recruits in "faith-based combat techniques"

## The Great Deception
### Ironic Truth
- Most zealous anti-crystal crusader is powered by a Shard
- His "divine miracles" come from the very corruption he fights
- Coalition's greatest weapon contradicts their core beliefs
- His existence proves Shards aren't inherently corrupting
- Discovery would shatter Coalition ideology and his personal faith

### Signs Others Might Notice
- Amber glow sometimes visible through shirt during intense moments
- Unnaturally quick recovery from serious wounds
- Animals and nature spirits are drawn to him (Shard resonance)
- Crystal corruption dies away in his immediate presence
- Dreams of golden light and divine authority

## Current Situation
### Growing Power
- Shard abilities becoming stronger and more obvious
- Other Coalition members beginning to ask questions
- Unconsciously drawn toward other Shard locations
- Experiencing prophetic dreams about "divine reunification"
- Internal conflict between duty and inexplicable urges

### The Investigation
- **[[Scholar Vivienne the Chronicler]]**: Suspects his true nature
- **[[The Crimson Sage|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]]**: May recognize Shard resonance
- **[[Keeper of the Shattered Crown, Marcus Crystalvein]]**: Senses kinship
- **Coalition Doctors**: Notice his impossible healing rate
- **Enemy Survivors**: Report his "unnatural" resilience

## Relationships
### Coalition Bonds
- **[[High Inquisitor Maltheos|02 Worldbuilding/People/High Inquisitor Maltheos]]**: Beloved mentor and father figure
- **[[Brother Marcus Steelbane]]**: Fellow Coalition member, growing suspicious
- **Pure Strike Team**: Utterly devoted followers
- **Coalition Rank and File**: View him as living saint
- **Coalition Enemies**: Fear his "divine protection"

### External Relations
- **[[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde|02 Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]**: Personal enemy (has tried to kill her)
- **Crystal Researchers**: Prime target for assassination
- **[[Silverscale Consortium|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/Silverscale Consortium]]**: Would pay fortune for his "secret"
- **Other Shard Bearers**: Unconscious attraction to them

## Adventure Hooks
1. **The Righteous Doubt**: Help him discover his true nature without destroying him
2. **The Coalition Crisis**: Manage fallout when his secret is revealed
3. **The Pure Strike**: Join or stop his mission against crystal facility
4. **The Amber Truth**: Investigate source of his miraculous abilities
5. **The Faithful Enemy**: Face him as antagonist who genuinely believes he's righteous

## Moral Complexity
### The Faith Dilemma
- Genuinely believes in Coalition cause and fights evil
- His methods are extreme but his goals are noble
- Discovery of truth would destroy everything he believes
- Coalition needs him but ideology condemns him
- Represents question: do motives matter more than methods?

### The Irony Crisis
- Most effective anti-Shard crusader is Shard bearer
- His "purity" comes from the very corruption he opposes
- Coalition's living symbol contradicts their core beliefs
- Truth would help or destroy the organization
- His power could be used for good if he accepted it

## Potential Character Development
### If Truth Revealed
- **Denial**: Refuse to believe evidence
- **Crisis**: Complete breakdown of faith and identity
- **Acceptance**: Embrace new understanding of Shards
- **Corruption**: Let revelation twist him toward evil
- **Integration**: Find balance between faith and power

### Story Paths
- Becomes ally once he accepts truth
- Turns into tragic villain consumed by betrayal
- Leads Coalition reform toward more moderate stance
- Sacrifices himself to save others from his "corruption"
- Becomes bridge between Coalition and Shard bearers

## Connected Elements
- Central to [[The Seven Shards|Amber Shard]] storylines
- Key figure in [[Purist Coalition|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/Purist Coalition]] internal conflicts
- Represents themes of faith, deception, and moral complexity
- Links Shard mythology to religious extremism storylines

**Amber Burst (3/Day).** Matthias's shard flares with golden light. All creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. Enemies take 27 (6d8) radiant damage on a failure (half on success), while allies regain 27 hit points. Corrupted creatures and objects in the area are automatically purified.

**Divine Judgment (1/Day).** Matthias calls upon what he believes is divine justice. Target creature within 60 feet must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw.

If the target dies while marked, they cannot be resurrected by any means short of divine intervention.

**Purifying Touch (Recharge 5-6).** Matthias touches a creature, object, or area within 5 feet. Instantly removes all curses, diseases, poisons, and magical corruption. Against corrupted creatures, this deals 36 (8d8) radiant damage (Constitution save DC 19 for half).

## Prophecies & Divine "Visions"

### The Amber Prophecy (Misinterpreted)

*"A child of gold shall speak words that either heal or damn all creation. The bearer of earth's strength must choose - protect the innocent or preserve the cause."*

**Matthias's Interpretation**: Test of faith involving protecting worthy children  
**True Meaning**: His future choice regarding [[Gareth Goldenheart, The Chosen Vessel]]

### Current Divine "Guidance"
Matthias receives what he believes are divine visions:
