I need you to create a rich, interconnected homebrew D&D world in my Obsidian TTRPG vault. Here are the requirements and context:

## Vault Context
- **Location:** `/Users/jongosussmango/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/ObsidianTTRPGVault Experimental`
- **System:** Using Obsidian Bases v1.9.7 with full linking capabilities
- **Structure:** Already has templates and base files configured for NPCs, Locations, Quests, Sessions, etc.

## World Creation Requirements

### Core Concept
Create a unique, original D&D continent/world with:
1. A compelling central premise or unique feature that sets it apart
2. Rich history with at least 3 major historical events that shaped the current world
3. Multiple interconnected regions (at least 5-7 distinct areas)
4. Complex political landscape with competing factions
5. Blend of traditional D&D elements with unique twists

### Content to Create

#### Locations (10-15 notes)
- 1 main continent/world overview note
- 3-4 major cities with distinct cultures
- 2-3 wilderness regions with unique features
- 2-3 dungeons/adventure sites
- 1-2 mystical/planar locations
- Each with shops, services, NPCs, and plot hooks

#### NPCs (15-20 notes)
- 3-4 major political leaders
- 3-4 faction leaders
- 4-5 important merchants/service providers
- 2-3 antagonists/villains
- 3-4 mysterious/quest-giving NPCs
- Each with relationships to other NPCs, quests, and locations

#### Factions (5-7 notes)
- Government/ruling body
- Religious organizations
- Merchant guilds
- Secret societies
- Opposition/rebel groups
- Each with goals, members, and conflicts

#### Quests (10-12 notes)
- 3-4 main story arc quests with prerequisites
- 4-5 side quests linking NPCs and locations
- 2-3 faction-specific quest chains
- Each with NPCs, locations, rewards, and consequences

#### Lore & History (5-7 notes)
- Creation myth/origin story
- Major historical events
- Important artifacts/magic items
- Unique magic system or phenomena
- Cultural traditions and holidays

### Technical Requirements

1. **Use Proper Linking:**
   - All references between notes should use `[[Note Name]]` format
   - Ensure bidirectional relationships (if A links to B, B should link to A where appropriate)
   - Use the exact note names for reliable linking

2. **Follow Template Structure:**
   - Use appropriate tags for each note type
   - Include all required frontmatter properties
   - Set image paths to `Î©_Assets/` structure

3. **Create Interconnections:**
   - Each NPC should have 3-5 relationships
   - Each location should reference 3-5 NPCs
   - Quests should involve multiple NPCs and locations
   - Factions should have member NPCs and controlled locations

4. **Depth & Richness:**
   - Include secrets and DM notes in each entry
   - Create plot hooks and adventure seeds
   - Add random encounter tables where appropriate
   - Include current events and ongoing conflicts

5. **Consistency:**
   - Maintain consistent tone and naming conventions
   - Ensure historical events are referenced across multiple notes
   - Keep power levels and danger ratings logical
   - Make the economy and trade routes make sense

### World Style Preferences
[You can customize this section]
- **Tone:** [e.g., Dark fantasy, High adventure, Political intrigue, etc.]
- **Magic Level:** [e.g., High magic, Low magic, Dying magic, etc.]
- **Technology:** [e.g., Medieval, Renaissance, Magitech, etc.]
- **Inspiration:** [e.g., Celtic mythology, Arabian Nights, Cosmic horror, etc.]

### File Organization
Create everything under: `/01_Campaigns/[WorldName]/`
With subfolders:
- `/NPCs/`
- `/Locations/`
- `/Quests/`
- `/Factions/`
- `/Lore/`
- `/Sessions/` (for future use)

### Additional Features
Also create:
1. A world map description (even if we can't generate the image)
2. A calendar system with important dates
3. A pantheon of gods (if applicable)
4. Trade routes and economic systems
5. Languages and cultures
6. Current world-shaking events the party could get involved in

Please create all of these notes with full content, ensuring they're deeply interconnected and reference each other appropriately. Each note should be complete and ready for use in an actual D&D campaign.

After creating the world, also provide:
1. A suggested Session 0 outline
2. Three different campaign starter scenarios
3. A list of how all the content interconnects (a relationship map)

## Additional Context for the AI:
- I have templates at `/05_Templates/` for all note types
- The vault uses Obsidian Bases for database functionality
- All notes should be markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- The goal is a living world that feels real and interconnected
- This will be used for an actual D&D 5e campaign
