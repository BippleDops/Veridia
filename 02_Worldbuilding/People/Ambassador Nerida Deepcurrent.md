# Ambassador Nerida Deepcurrent

## Overview
The enigmatic envoy from the Tidal Courts of Aquabyssos, a vast underwater empire thought lost to legend. Nerida arrived in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven]] six months ago, claiming to represent the "Drowned Parliament"—a coalition of submerged civilizations that have thrived beneath the waves for centuries.

## Appearance
- Aquamarine skin with bioluminescent markings that pulse with emotion
- Long hair like flowing kelp, adorned with pearls and coral
- Wears a gown of woven sea silk that never fully dries
- Travels in a palanquin filled with enchanted seawater
- Accompanied by two Deep Guard warriors in coral armor

## Personality
- Diplomatically charming but subtly condescending toward "surface dwellers"
- Views the crystal corruption as primitive compared to Aquabyssos's magical mastery
- Genuinely curious about surface politics but maintains superiority
- Speaks in maritime metaphors and references to depths

## Abilities & Stats
**AC:** 16 (Deep Magic Ward)
**HP:** 88 (11d8 + 33)
**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 60 ft.

**STR:** 12 (+1) **DEX:** 16 (+3) **CON:** 16 (+3)
**INT:** 18 (+4) **WIS:** 15 (+2) **CHA:** 20 (+5)

### Special Abilities
- **Amphibious:** Can breathe air and water
- **Deep Speech:** Can communicate telepathically with aquatic creatures
- **Tidal Manipulation:** Can control water within 30 feet
- **Pact of the Drowned God:** Has a warlock pact with Thal'mexis, the Sunken Sovereign

### Spells (Save DC 17)
- Bardic magic focused on enchantment and illusion
- Warlock invocations granting water control and psychic abilities

## Relationships
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]**: Maintains cordial diplomatic relations while secretly assessing her weakness
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Prince Caspian Duskwater]]**: Sees him as potentially useful for future succession manipulation
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Captain Thaddeus Blackwater]]**: Knows his ships have discovered Aquabyssos ruins; wants him silenced or recruited
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]]**: Trading partner for smuggling operations between surface and depths
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Master Artificer Korvin Gearwright]]**: Fascinated by his crystal technology; secretly offers deep-sea materials
- **Sister Morwyn Veilkeeper**: Exchanges prophetic visions about the coming convergence

## Current Activities
- Negotiating exclusive trade rights for deep-sea resources
- Secretly mapping Aethermoor's crystal deposits for the Drowned Parliament
- Recruiting surface agents for intelligence gathering
- Establishing hidden water-gates for rapid underwater transport
- Investigating the connection between the Seven Shards and the Great Drowning

## Secrets
> [!warning] DM Only
> - Actually serves the Leviathan Council, not just the Drowned Parliament
> - Knows that three of the Seven Shards originated from Aquabyssos temples
> - Has been marking key surface dwellers with invisible deep-marks for future "collection"
> - The palanquin water contains a scrying pool linked to the Sunken Sovereign
> - Plans to trigger controlled flooding of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]] to establish an Aquabyssos foothold
> - Carries a Tide Pearl that can summon a tsunami once per year

## Embassy: The Cerulean Depths
Located in Crystalhaven's Embassy Quarter, her residence is a architectural marvel:
- Building partially flooded with breathable enchanted water
- Contains a portal pool to Aquabyssos (heavily guarded secret)
- Houses a growing collection of surface artifacts for study
- Basement connects to flooded tunnels beneath the city

## Plot Hooks
1. Hires party to retrieve a sunken relic from pre-drowning ruins
2. Requests escort to [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]] for "trade negotiations"
3. Offers valuable information about underwater passages in exchange for crystal samples
4. Needs discrete investigation of ships that have been exploring too deep

## Quotes
- "The surface tension between our worlds grows thin."
- "Your crystals corrupt, but water purifies. Perhaps a flood would cleanse your lands."
- "Depth has privileges you surface dwellers cannot fathom."
- "The tide rises, whether you will it or not."

## DM Notes
Nerida represents the looming threat of Aquabyssos while maintaining plausible deniability. She's a master manipulator who views the surface world as a chess board for the Tidal Courts' expansion. Her presence should make players question whether cooperation or conflict with the underwater realm is inevitable.
