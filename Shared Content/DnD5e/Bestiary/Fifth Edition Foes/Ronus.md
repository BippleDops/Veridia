## Description
When the sound of a falcon’s shriek and a wolf’s howl mix together in the night air, chances are good that a ronus is nearby and about to strike. Turning and running won’t help; that only incites the pack, because they know few normal creatures can outrun them.

Ronuses always hunt in packs. The only time a runus is encountered alone is if it is injured, sick, old, or cast out of its pack. Such a creature won’t attack unless provoked and fights only to defend itself.

Ronuses live by hunting for fresh meat. They will eat anything from mice to rabbits to goblins to ogres; anything they can catch and kill is food. Prey is attacked and dispatched as quickly as possible, before it has a chance to mount a defense against the pack. Prey is eaten where it falls. The pack ravenously devours most of the meat, but enough is left behind on the bones for other scavengers—which encourages creatures the ronuses can eat to live in their territory.

A ronus lair is always hard to find, being camouflaged with boulders, leaves, fallen trees, and broken tree limbs. Although they hunt in forests, they prefer rocky areas for their lairs, because stony ground makes it harder for enemies to follow the ronuses’ tracks to their lair’s entrance. In areas where hunting is good, several ronus packs might share the same lair. They are smart enough to understand that there’s safety in numbers.

Ronuses are blazingly fast sprinters. They use their speed to great advantage when hunting. While one portion of the pack stalks prey noisily to keep it moving and to keep its attention focused on what’s behind, another portion races ahead at top speed and waits for the prey to stumble into their ambush, where they’ll be caught with no way forward and no way back.
