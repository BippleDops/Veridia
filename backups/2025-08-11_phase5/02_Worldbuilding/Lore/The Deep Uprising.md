# The Deep Uprising

*"From the crushing depths came voices that would not be silenced."*

## Overview
The Deep Uprising was a revolutionary movement led by the deepest-dwelling inhabitants of Aquabyssos who felt marginalized by the surface-oriented politics of the upper city. These deep dwellers, adapted to extreme pressure and darkness, demanded greater representation and challenged the depth-based social hierarchy that had dominated underwater society.

- **Social Revolution**: Challenges to depth-based hierarchies
- **Infrastructure Development**: Improved deep-level facilities
