*Wondrous item, common (requires attunement by a wizard)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/hat-of-wizardry.webp#right) This cone-shaped hat is adorned with moons and stars. While you are wearing it, you gain the following benefits. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Spellcasting Focus You can use the hat as a [[spellcasting-focus-xphb (variant-rules) for your Wizard spells. ## Unknown Spell As a [actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you can try to cast a cantrip that you don't know. The cantrip must be on the Wizard spell list and have a casting time of an action, and you make a **DC 10** Intelligence ([[skills#Arcana|Arcana) check. On a successful check, you cast the spell. On a failed check, the spell fails, and the action used to cast the spell is wasted. In either case, you can't use this property again until you finish a [long-rest-xphb]]. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 267* ## Player-Facing Summary Hat of wizardry xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
