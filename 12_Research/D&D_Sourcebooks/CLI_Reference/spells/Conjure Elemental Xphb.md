# Conjure Elemental
*5th-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You conjure a Large, intangible spirit from the Elemental Planes that appears in an unoccupied space within range. Choose the spirit's element, which determines its damage type: air (Lightning), earth (Thunder), fire (Fire), or water (Cold). The spirit lasts for the duration.

Whenever a creature you can see enters the spirit's space or starts its turn within 5 feet of the spirit, you can force that creature to make a Dexterity saving throw if the spirit has no creature [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]]. On failed save, the target takes `8d8` damage of the spirit's type, and the target has the [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition until the spell ends. At the start of each of its turns, the [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] target repeats the save. On a failed save, the target takes `4d8` damage of the spirit's type. On a successful save, the target isn't [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] by the spirit.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d8` for each spell slot level above 5.
