We perform identity reassignment."* ## üé¨ [Strong Start]]

The party infiltrates the [[Surgical Sanctum to find hundreds of bodies suspended in tanks, each being slowly separated from their shadows. One tank contains someone identical to a party member. [The Surgeon]] Prime appears: "Ah, you've found your prototypes. Don't worry‚Äîwe'll reunite you with your true selves soon enough." ### Scene 1: [[The Prototype Ward

**Location**: Sublevel 3 - [Duplication Chambers]] **Situation**: Discovery of duplicate party members **Conflict**: Duplicates awaken and believe they're the originals **Discoveries**:
- Every person in Aquabyssos has a "prototype" made
- Prototypes are shadow-human hybrids
- They have all the original's memories up to creation point
- The duplicates genuinely believe the party are imposters **[[Roleplay Crisis**:
- Duplicates know things only PCs would know
- They beg for help, claiming to be trapped
- One duplicate warns about "the real surgeon"
- Marina finds THREE versions of herself ### Scene 2: [The Operating]] Theater

**Location**: [[Central Surgical Amphitheater **Situation**: Witness mass shadow transplant surgery **Conflict**: Interrupt procedure without killing patients **Discoveries**:
- [[[The Silhouette]] [[Surgeon Prime]] is actually multiple shadows in one body
- Surgeries are creating agents for continental infiltration
- [[Jasper "Three-Eyes" Flint is here‚Äîas a willing surgeon
- The procedures are reversible for exactly 3 hours **[Skill Challenge]] - Stop the Surgery**:
- **Medicine **DC 16****: Safely disconnect patients
- **Sleight of Hand **DC 15****: Sabotage equipment
- **Deception **DC 17****: Pose as surgical staff
- **Failure**: Patients die or transform immediately ### Scene 3: [[The Identity Laboratory

**Location**: [Research Wing]] - [[Consciousness Studies **Situation**: Marina confronts her shadow with party present **Conflict**: Determine who is the "real" Marina **Discoveries**:
- [Both Marinas]] have complete memories
- [[Shadow Marina has scars the original doesn't
- [Original Marina]] bleeds shadow instead of blood
- They've been switching places repeatedly for years **[[The Marina Test**:
- Party must determine who to support
- [Each Marina]] provides evidence
- Wrong choice has campaign consequences
- Truth: They're both "real" in different ways ### Scene 4: [[The Surgeon's Gambit

**Location**: [The Prime]] Surgeon's [[Private Lab **Situation**: Surgeon offers to make party immune to harvest **Conflict**: Procedure requires sacrificing their shadows **Discoveries**:
- Surgeon was first successful human-shadow fusion
- The harvest is actually a mass evolution event
- Shadows aren't evil‚Äîthey're trying to survive
- [The Deep]] Mother created shadows as backup humanity **[[The Ultimate Choice**:
- **Option A**: Accept fusion (become shadow hybrids)
- **Option B**: Destroy the facility (kill thousands)
- **Option C**: Negotiate coexistence terms
- **Option D**: Steal the research and flee ### [The Choice]] Chamber

Special mechanics for Marina confrontation:
- Zone of Truth effect (no lies possible)
- Memories manifest as visible projections
- Emotional damage for wrong accusations
- Time pressure: 10 rounds before security arrives ## üîç Secrets & Clues

1. [[The Surgeon Prime is composed of 12 different shadows
2. [Jasper "Three-Eyes" Flint]] volunteered to help harvest
3. Every major NPC [[has a prototype prepared
4. The surgical facilities extend across all continents
5. Shadow evolution is inevitable, not stoppable
6. The [Parliament of Echoes]] approved the surgeries
7. [[[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]] has a prototype in [[Aethermoor
8. [The Memory]] Tides are carrying surgical instructions
9. Children adapt to shadow fusion better than adults
10. The real threat isn't shadows‚Äîit's what they're fleeing from ## üé™ [[Cliffhanger Ending

Regardless of choices made, as the party escapes the facility, every shadow in Tenebrarum suddenly points toward [Crystallium]]. [[The Surgeon Prime's head (or remains) speaks: "You fools. The resoce has already begun. In three hours, every shadow in Aquabyssos will hear the call. You can't stop the harvest‚Äîyou can only choose whether to guide it or be consumed by it." Marina (whichever one remains) reveals a final secret: "There's something you need to know about [Crystallium]]. The entire continent is a transmission tower. And it's not calling to our shadows‚Äîit's calling to something else's. We're not the harvest. We're the bait." Through the window, the party sees the ocean literally cracking like glass, revealing something massive moving beneath reality itself. --- ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*
