# Damage Types
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 365. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* 

Attacks and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as Resistance, rely on the types. The Damage Types table offers examples to help a DM assign a type to a new effect.

**Damage Types**

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Acid | Corrosive liquids, digestive enzymes |
| Bludgeoning | Blunt objects, constriction, falling |
| Cold | Freezing water, icy blasts |
| Fire | Flames, unbearable heat |
| Force | Pure magical energy |
| Lightning | Electricity |
| Necrotic | Life-draining energy |
| Piercing | Fangs, puncturing objects |
| Poison | Toxic gas, venom |
| Psychic | Mind-rending energy |
| Radiant | Holy energy, searing radiation |
| Slashing | Claws, cutting objects |
| Thunder | Concussive sound |
