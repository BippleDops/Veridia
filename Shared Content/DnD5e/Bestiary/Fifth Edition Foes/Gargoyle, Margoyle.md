*Several varieties of gargoyles exist, and each is detailed below. For all their differences, gargoyles also share some common traits. They can remain utterly motionless for days, weeks, or even years, and they are indistinguishable from stone for as long as they remain still. Regardless of how long they’ve been inert, they can spring into sudden, savage action in an instant.*

*This creature looks like a hideously ugly humanoid chiseled from brown stone. Two large horns protrude from its head, just above its eyes. Four large, stony spikes jut from its shoulder blades. Its hands and feet end in sharpened claws.*

**Environment**: Any land, aquatic, and underground

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, or wing (1–2 margoyles and 4–6 gargoyles or [[Gargoyle, Four-Armed|four-armed gargoyles]])

## Description
A margoyle is nothing more than a slightly larger version of a typical gargoyle. It is, however, meaner, deadlier, and even more evil than the normal gargoyle, if such a thing is imaginable. Margoyles are most often encountered in subterranean regions, where they typically have a pack of gargoyles accompanying them. In such cases, the margoyle is almost always looked upon as the master or leader of the group.

## Additional Details
**Credit**: The margoyle originally appeared in the First Edition module S4 Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth (© TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1982) and later in the First Edition Monster Manual II (© TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission. It was called a “marlgoyle” in S4 (note the extra “l”).
