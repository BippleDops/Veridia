*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 206. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* Ice mephits have bodies made of frigid air and frozen water. They delight in freezing things and dropping ice into peoples' clothes. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Mephits *Malicious Elemental Hooligans* - **Habitat.** Planar (Elemental Planes) - **Treasure.** None Mephits are mean-spirited tricksters that dwell on the Elemental Planes. The six most prominent types of mephits resemble halfling-size gargoyles with wings, exaggerated features, and bodies composed of two elements. Most live self-interested existences, indulging their warped senses of humor or overblown egos on their home planes of existence. Some serve as messengers or spies for genies or magic-users. Mephits resent leaving the elemental extremes where they make their homes. If loosed on the Material Plane or other realms, they lash out with nasty pranks or by tormenting weaker creatures. When destroyed, mephits explode in a burst of elemental magic. > [!quote] A quote from Seamusxanthuszenus, smoke mephit with a typically inflated impression of itself > > I am Seamusxanthuszenus, Slayer of Fiends, Merchant Most Excellent, Purveyor of Death!```statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of ice mephit xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around ice mephit xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Strange dreams suggest a portal
