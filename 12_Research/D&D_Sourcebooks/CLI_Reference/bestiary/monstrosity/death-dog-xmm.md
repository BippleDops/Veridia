## Death Dog

*Two-Headed Spreader of Disease*

- **Habitat.** Desert  
- **Treasure.** None  

Death dogs are plagues on the arid lands they inhabit. These vicious, two-headed canines ambush creatures they perceive as weaker than themselves, favoring the wounded or infirm. They attack recklessly, infecting as many creatures as possible with their diseased jaws. If driven off, death dogs linger close to their victims, letting infection weaken their prey before they attack again.

Legends tie death dogs to malicious death gods, the underworld, and cursed rulers. These stories are based on the malady death dogs spread. Roll on or choose a result from the Death Dog Malady Symptoms table to inspire symptoms spread by a death dog's bite. These symptoms are cosmetic and don't alter the effects of the death dog's Bite action. The symptoms vanish when a creature no longer has the [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition from a death dog's Bite.

| 2 | The victim's body to wither, as if constantly exposed to desert heat. |
| 3 | The victim to be distracted by distant howling or vague whispers only they can hear. |
| 4 | The victim's flesh to rot like a corpse. |
| 5 | The victim to itch, as if they had fleas or sand beneath their skin. |
| 6 | Wicked symbols to gradually appear on and spread across the victim's body. |
