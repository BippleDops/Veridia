# Blight
## Overview
```ad-warning
title: GM Directions
collapse: open
This peculiar lichen is ubiquitous to the city of Castorhage. Reports of large infestations of it occur in the earliest city records, and it is from this constant presence that the city has obtained its nickname. It is a leafy foliose lichen with a dull gray coloring that is darker on the underside. Its drab coloration makes it difficult to see from distances greater than 10 feet in any conditions other than bright light; it’s noticed with a successful DC 12 Wis (Perception) check.

Blight grows slowly except in total darkness, where it grows so rapidly it can cover hundreds of feet in only a few hours. Infestations of the lichen tend to pop up in the darkest of alleys or on heavily overcast or moonless nights. The dwarves of the Underneath warn of caverns where the stuff grows unchecked, forming drifts dozens of feet deep. Blight grows no more rapidly in bright light than normal lichen, but it isn’t harmed by bright light.

Furthermore, some scholars speculate that the lichen might possess some form of intelligence. They base this on the fact that when options for growth exist toward and away from some living victim that the blight can grow on, it always grows toward the living victim.

Each 5-foot-square of blight has AC 5 and 16 (`dice: 3d8`) hit points. It is resistant to nonmagical bludgeoning and slashing damage, immune to piercing and psychic damage, and vulnerable to fire damage.

Blight is generally harmless to creatures that are aware of it, but its dense, rapid growth in darkness makes it very dangerous to a helpless creature. If a helpless creature (asleep, drunk, paralyzed, etc.) is in an area of total darkness that blight has access to, a thick, impervious layer of lichen can grow completely over the creature in `dice: 1d6` rounds. This causes no physical injury, but the creature is restrained and cut off from air; when its breath runs out, it begins suffocating. The creature can break free by using an action to make a successful DC 15 Str (Athletics) or Dex (Acrobatics) check. An adjacent ally can free the trapped character with a Str (Athletics) check, or by inflicting 15 slashing damage to the blight.

If a victim is slain by blight or if it grows over the corpse of a living creature, a truly remarkable quality of the growth is revealed. Whereas most surfaces that the lichen uses as a substrate are unharmed by its growth, the corpse of a living creature is absorbed in short order and will be completely gone within hours, leaving nothing behind but inorganic remnants such as belt buckles, swords and armor, gold fillings, etc. A Tiny or smaller creature is totally obliterated in 15 minutes; a Small creature disappears in 30 minutes, and a Medium creature in 1 hour. Large creatures will be completely absorbed in 4 hours, and Huge creatures in 9 hours. Gargantuan and Colossal creatures will be absorbed only if the blight is able to completely cover it. If so, the corpses are absorbed in 16 and 36 hours, respectively. A creature absorbed by blight cannot be returned from the dead by anything less powerful than *true resurrection*.
