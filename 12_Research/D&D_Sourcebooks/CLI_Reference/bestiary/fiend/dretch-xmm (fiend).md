*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 103. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* Lone dretches serve other demons or evil magic-users. They are erratic, filthy, and violent, and they demonstrate little sense of self-preservation. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Dretches *Demons of Frenzy and Vulgarity* - **Habitat.** Planar (Abyss) - **Treasure.** None The servants and victims of greater demons, dretches embody petty instincts, chaotic impulses, and violent urges. Dretches exist in unfathomable numbers in the depths of the Abyss, where their reeking throngs fill vast demonic hordes. > [!quote] A quote from Jaranda, Expert on the Abyss > > Ah, the infinite wonders of the Abyss.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of dretch xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around dretch xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is searching for a witness for money
