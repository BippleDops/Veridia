This dark gift allows its beneficiary to cast the [[Suggestion Xphb]] spell as an action, and saving throws against the spell have disadvantage. After it has been used three times, the dark gift vanishes. The beneficiary of this dark gift gains an extra finger on each hand, as well as the following flaw: "I can't get enough pleasure. I desire others to create beauty for me at all times." *Source: Curse of Strahd p. 192* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Dark gift of shami amourae the lady of delights cos is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
