# Spell Book Name: Grimoire of the Arcane 

This spell book is made of ancient leather that feels rough and worn to the touch. The pages are yellowed and brittle, but they hold strong magical power. The cover has a sigil of a pentagram carved into it that glows a faint blue when spells are being cast from the book. The book emits a musky, mysterious smell that lingers in the air long after it's been opened.

> [!warning]
> This book previously belonged to a powerful warlock named Zarek who was known for his dark magic and malicious intentions. It is said that he used this book to summon unholy creatures and perform curses on his enemies. Be careful when handling this book as it still holds some of Zarek's malevolent energy.
