# Staff of Birdcalls

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Melee Weapon, Staff

**Rarity:** common

**Weight**: 4 lbs.

**Damage:** 1d6 bludgeoning versatile (1d8)

## Description

This wooden staff is decorated with bird carvings. It has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the staff and cause it to create one of the following sounds out to a range of 60 feet: a finch's chirp, a raven's caw, a duck's quack, a chicken's cluck, a goose's honk, a loon's call, a turkey's gobble, a seagull's cry, an owl's hoot, or an eagle's shriek.

The staff regains `dice: 1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice: d20`. On a 1, the staff explodes in a harmless cloud of bird feathers and is lost forever.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
