--- # Zephyr Strike

*1st-level, Transmutation* - **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute You move like the wind. Until the spell ends, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. Once before the spell ends, you can give yourself advantage on one weapon attack roll on your turn. That attack deals an extra`d8`force damage on a hit. Whether you hit or miss, your walking speed increases by 30 feet until the end of that turn. **Classes**: [[classes]] *Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 171* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Zephyr strike xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
