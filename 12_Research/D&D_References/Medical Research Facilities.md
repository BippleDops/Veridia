Foreign nations pay substantial fees for access to Aquabyssos plague research data. This revenue helps offset research costs but raises questions about information equity.

**Medical Tourism**
Wealthy plague victims from other regions travel to access cutting-edge treatments. This generates revenue but strains already limited medical resources.

## Adventure Hooks

### The Sabotaged Experiment
A crucial experiment that could lead to a cure has been sabotaged, setting back research by months. Investigation reveals a complex web of competing interests - [[Crystal Cult Temples]] infiltrators, foreign spies, and rival research institutions all had motives.

### The Ethical Dilemma
A researcher has discovered a potential cure, but testing it requires sacrificing a group of Stage 4 patients. The ethics board is deadlocked, and desperate families are demanding action while patient advocates protest the exploitation.

### The Stolen Samples
Irreplaceable plague specimens have been stolen from the high-security containment lab. The thieves left behind clues suggesting they plan to weaponize the samples. Time is running out to prevent a deliberate plague outbreak.

### The Volunteer Crisis
Research has ground to a halt due to lack of volunteer test subjects. Investigating the cause reveals someone has been threatening potential volunteers, but whether it's cult intimidation, government pressure, or rival institution interference remains unclear.

### The Breakthrough Discovery
A young researcher has made a revolutionary discovery but refuses to share it with the official research community. Investigation reveals she's being blackmailed by someone who wants to control the cure for their own purposes.
