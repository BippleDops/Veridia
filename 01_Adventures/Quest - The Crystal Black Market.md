**Difficulty**: Moderate (Levels 3-5)


A new drug called "Shard Dust" is flooding the streetsâ€”powdered crystal that grants temporary magical abilities but accelerates corruption. Someone has established an industrial-scale operation to harvest and process crystal corruption from living victims. The operation threatens to destabilize the entire economy while creating an army of crystal-addicted servants. Meanwhile, ## Quest Hook

[[Castellan Ironledger III|02 Worldbuilding/People/Castellan Ironledger III]] contacts the party discretely. Three of his best informants have died investigating the Shard Dust trade, and his normal business operations undermined by this new economy. He offers substantial payment and future favors for dismantling the operationâ€”but warns that powerful people are involved. ### The Ironledger Briefing

This quest explores the corruption of previously noble institutions and the moral complexity of the "greater excellent" argument. It provides opportunities for investigation, combat, and difficult moral choices with no perfect solutions. The Shard Dust epidemic can become an ongoing campaign element, and the revelations about government corruption can trigger larger political upheavals. The quest connects multiple NPCs and factions while introducing personal stakes through the victims and addicts encountered. ## Player-Facing Summary Quest The Crystal Black Market is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Quest The Crystal Black Market as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Quest The Crystal Black Market. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Secret Covenant - Summon ancient evil ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## Background
