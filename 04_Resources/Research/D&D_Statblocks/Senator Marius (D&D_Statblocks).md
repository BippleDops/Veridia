Senator Marcus Marius represents the progressive wing of Aquabyssos's Parliament, a charismatic sea elf whose impassioned speeches and reform agenda have made him both a beloved champion of the common people and a target for conservative factions. Born into minor nobility but raised with commoners after his family's disgrace, Marcus combines aristocratic education with genuine understanding of ordinary citizens' struggles. ## Physical Description & Background

At 5'9" with the graceful build typical of sea elves, Marcus has flowing silver-blue hair and deep green eyes that flash with conviction when he speaks. Unlike many senators, he dresses modestly and often wears a simple pendant bearing the symbol of Aquabyssos's founding principles. Scars on his hands tell the story of his youth working alongside common laborers. Born to House Tidespeaker, a minor noble family that lost their fortune defending commoners' rights, Marcus was raised understanding both privilege and poverty. His natural charisma and brilliant oratory skills earned him a seat in the Senate, where he champions democratic reforms, workers' rights, and government transparency. ## Special Abilities **Inspiring Oratory.** Can cast *mass suggestion* once per day through passionate speech, affecting up to 12 creatures within 60 feet. **Bardic Inspiration.** Can inspire allies with stirring words (Bardic Inspiration dice: d8, 4 uses per short rest). **Silver Tongue.** Has advantage on all Persuasion checks and can reroll failed Charisma-based social encounters once per day. **Political Protection.** As a sitting senator, has legal immunity from most criminal charges and can call for parliamentary protection. **Spellcasting (9th level bard).** Spell save **DC 16**, +8 to hit. Known spells focus on enchantment, divination, and social manipulation. ## Actions **Multiattack.** Makes two attacks with Ceremonial Sword or casts a spell and makes one attack. **Ceremonial Sword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 7 (`dice: 1d8` + 3) slashing damage. (Marcus prefers negotiation to combat) **Rallying Speech (1/Day).** All allies within 60 feet gain 15 temporary hit points and advantage on their next ability check or saving throw. **Parliamentary Immunity (3/Day).** Can invoke senatorial privilege to avoid consequences of social or legal challenges. ## Adventure Hooks

1. **The Assassination Plot** - Marcus has been targeted for elimination by unknown enemies
2. **The Reform Bill** - Crucial legislation needs protection from sabotage and corruption
3. **The People's Champion** - Marcus needs bodyguards for a dangerous public appearance
4. **The Corruption Investigation** - Evidence of Senate misconduct requires discrete investigation
5. **The Democratic Crisis** - Imperial forces threaten to dissolve Parliament; Marcus leads resistance
6. **The Worker's Strike** - Labor dispute requires mediation before it turns violent
7. **The Shadow Influence** - Dark forces are manipulating political opposition to Marcus ## Roleplaying Notes

**Voice**: Rich, resot, with perfect diction. Speaks with passion about justice and reform.
**Mannerisms**: Gestures dramatically when speaking, touches his family pendant when thinking of principles, stands when making important points.
**Speaking Patterns**: "The people of Aquabyssos deserve better...", "Justice delayed is justice denied...", "We must be the change we wish to see in our empire..." Marcus represents idealistic reform in a corrupt system, serving as a potential patron for heroic characters while facing constant threats from those who profit from the status quo. He embodies the struggle between pragmatic politics and moral principles. ## Player-Facing Summary Senator Marius is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Senator Marius as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Senator Marius. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Second Prophecy of Shadows ## Plot Hooks - A letter reveals a conspiracy about a local noble
