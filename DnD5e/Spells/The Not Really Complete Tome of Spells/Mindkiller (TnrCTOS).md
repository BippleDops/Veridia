# Mindkiller (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 300 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a gemstone worth at least 1,000 gp)

**Duration**: Special


## Effects
You completely suppress the personality of a single humanoid, turning its body into a mindless automaton. It follows your telepathic orders, as long as you are within 300 feet.

You can force the target to perform any sort of task that it normally could. You can force it to speak, although its voice will be nearly inflectionless. You can also use your action to see and hear through the target’s senses. You can make the target engage in combat or use its class abilities, including spells, but it requires your full concentration; you can take no other actions while com-manding the target.

You may control the target for a number of days equal to twice your spellcasting abil-ity modifier. At any point during that time, you may dismiss the spell and let the target’s mind reassert itself. The target will know that you have controlled it and will remem-ber what actions you have forced it to do. In addition, this spell can be broken with a *greater restoration* or *remove curse*.

If you allow the spell to continue, then when it expires, the creature’s personality dies and body die. In addition, you must make a Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 psychic damage.
