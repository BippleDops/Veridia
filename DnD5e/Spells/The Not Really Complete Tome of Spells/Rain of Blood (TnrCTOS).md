# Rain of Blood (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 150 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a vial of fresh blood)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
A storm of sticky, life-leeching, brilliant red blood appears in a location you choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least once face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half of much damage on a successful one, each round that the creature ends its turn in the storm and for one round afterwards.
