# Session 2: The Parliament's Paradox

> *"In the depths, yesterday's vote decides tomorrow's fate."*

## 🎭 Strong Start
The party enters the Debate Chambers to find themselves already there, participating in a debate that hasn't happened yet. Their future selves are voting on something called the "Shadow Accords," and one future party member is visibly a shadow wearing their skin.

## ⏰ Temporal Mechanics This Session

### Time Zones in Parliament
- **Past Pockets**: -24 hours (see yesterday's events)
- **Present Anchors**: Normal time (safe zones)
- **Future Bleeds**: +24 hours (tomorrow's consequences)
- **Paradox Storms**: Temporal damage zones

### Paradox Rules
- Seeing yourself: WIS save DC 13 or stunned 1 round
- Changing observed future: Take 1d6 psychic damage
- Creating paradox: Reality backlash (2d6 force damage)
- Temporal anchor: Advantage on saves

## 🔍 Scenes

### Scene 1: The Temporal Overlap
**Location**: Main Debate Floor
**Situation**: Navigate overlapping timelines in the chamber
**Conflict**: Must avoid paradox while gathering information

#### Timeline Navigation
- **Past Section**: Yesterday's failed vote to restrict shadows
- **Present Section**: Current confusion and investigation
- **Future Section**: Tomorrow's Shadow Accords passage

**Skill Challenges**:
- History DC 15: Recognize temporal inconsistencies
- Stealth DC 14: Avoid future selves' notice
- Investigation DC 13: Find timeline anchor points

**Discoveries**:
- The debate happens tomorrow
- Future party looks defeated/corrupted
- One senator exists in three timelines simultaneously

### Scene 2: The Forgotten Faction
**Location**: The Amnesia Gallery
**Situation**: Meeting with senators who've forgotten themselves
**Conflict**: Communicate with people who forget mid-conversation

#### The Forgotten
These senators have voluntarily erased their memories to avoid something worse. They speak in riddles and prophecy:

**Communication Challenge**:
- Round 1: Establish identity (Persuasion DC 13)
- Round 2: Maintain their attention (Performance DC 14)
- Round 3: Extract information (Insight DC 15)

**What They Remember**:
- "The shadows won before, will win again"
- "Seven harvests, seven failures, seven times forgotten"
- "The Protocol erases solutions with the problems"
- "She who casts no shadow knows the way"

**Discovery**: The Forgotten remember things that haven't happened and seven previous shadow harvests

### Scene 3: The Vote Vaults Investigation
**Location**: Lower Parliament - The Weight of Law
**Situation**: Investigating altered voting records
**Conflict**: Guardian constructs made of crystallized law

#### Vault Exploration
The vaults physically manifest the weight of decisions:
- Pearl votes (yes) make areas lighter
- Obsidian votes (no) make areas heavier
- Altered votes create gravity distortions

**Environmental Puzzle**:
- Navigate gravity shifts to reach Timeline B section
- Disable law constructs without destroying evidence
- Decode the altered voting patterns

**Discoveries**:
- Shadow votes counting double
- Non-existent senators being added
- Timeline B contains votes from erased timeline

### Scene 4: The Shadow Senator
**Location**: Private Meeting Chamber
**Situation**: Confronted by Glaucus's shadow, now independent
**Conflict**: Shadow offers alliance or threatens exposure

#### The Shadow's Offer
Glaucus's Shadow proposes:
- Information about the Inversion
- Protection from shadow replacement
- Access to shadow-only areas

In Exchange:
- Don't interfere with tomorrow's vote
- Help shadows gain citizenship
- Or be exposed as surface spies

**Discovery**: Shadow Duchess Nyx is coming to investigate

9. Marina has been meeting with shadow dissidents
10. The Protocol is a mass memory wipe system

## 🌓 Contingencies

### If Party Prevents Paradox
- Gain temporal immunity for next session
- Future selves provide cryptic warning
- Access to Timeline B vault section

### If Party Creates Paradox
- Paradox spawn attack
- Timeline shifts dramatically
- Lost in temporal loop (skill challenge to escape)

### If Party Allies with Shadows
- Gain shadow passage access
- Marked as shadow sympathizers
- Different information available
- Marina becomes suspicious

## 🎬 Cliffhanger Ending
During the night, the party witnesses their shadows having a meeting without them, using shadow-speech the party can't understand. Marina's shadow appears independently: "The Duchess arrives tomorrow. Your shadows have already voted to replace you. You have six hours to choose: join willingly, or be harvested. Oh, and that vote you saw today? You already lost it. You just don't remember yet."

## 📝 DM Notes

### Managing Temporal Complexity
- Use visual aids for timeline positions
- Keep paradox rules simple and consistent
- Let players be creative with time manipulation
- Don't overthink paradoxes—drama over logic

### The Forgotten Faction
- Speak in contradictions and riddles
- Provide true but confusing information
- They're tragic, not comic relief
- Their forgetting is intentional sacrifice

### Shadow Politics
- Shadows want recognition, not just replacement
- Some shadows are sympathetic
- Not all shadows agree on methods
- This is about existence rights

## 🎲 Quick Adjustments

**If Running Short on Time**:
- Skip the Vote Vaults investigation
- Have shadow confrontation during Forgotten meeting

**If Players Struggle with Temporal Mechanics**:
- Provide temporal anchor early
- Chronus becomes more helpful
- Reduce paradox penalties

**If Players Create Major Paradox**:
- Embrace it—make it part of story
- Timeline shifts to alternate version
- Future selves arrive to fix it

> *Remember: This session is about inevitability and choice. The future seems set, but player actions can still change everything—at a cost.*
