## Special Traits
**Amorphous and Incorporeal:** An ectoplasm can move through gaps as small as 1 square inch without penalty. It can also move through solid objects and other creatures as if they were difficult terrain. The ectoplasm takes `dice: 1d10` force damage if it is still inside something solid at the end of its turn.

**Glow:** An ectoplasm continually gives off light with the approximate brightness of a candle. It can't consciously extinguish this light. When an ectoplasm is killed, its light fades to darkness.

**Silent:** An ectoplasm has tactical advantage on Stealth checks when those detecting it are depending chiefly on sound.

**Undead Bane:** An ectoplasm deals double damage against corporeal undead.

## Actions
**Touch:** *Melee Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (`dice: 2d8+2`) psychic damage and the target gains one level of exhaustion. This attack has tactical advantage against targets wearing medium or heavy armor.

**Ectoplasm (Recharge 4—6):** Area Attack: automatic hit, range 20 ft. cone, all creatures in cone. Hit: targeted creatures must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for `dice: 1d6` rounds. A successful save renders a creature immune to that creature's ectoplasm's attack for 24 hours.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
Many encounters with glowing, ghostly spheres can be attributed to ectoplasms rather than restless spirits. An ectoplasm, sometimes called a ghost ooze, is a faintly glowing orb of immaterial substance that lurks in catacombs and cemeteries. Although incorrectly assumed by many to be some form of incorporeal undead, ectoplasms are quite alive. They dwell in places of the dead because they consume dead flesh, slowly dissolving decaying bones and skin and absorbing the nutrients directly. The strange irony of the ectoplasm is that a cemetery ‘haunted’ by these creatures is almost certain to be free of any corporeal undead; the ectoplasm makes a meal of them as soon as it discovers them.

Although its primary diet consists of the dead, an ectoplasm is also a threat to the living. An ectoplasm attacks anything within the range of its senses that disturbs it. An ectoplasm that encounters a living opponent attacks for a few rounds before attempting to escape—it senses that it can get no sustenance from the opponent. If it finds an undead opponent, an ectoplasm continues to attack until it or the opponent has been destroyed.

Ectoplasms are native to the Ethereal Plane. While ethereal, they can’t affect or be affected by anything in the material world. To consume carrion on the Material Plane, however, they must manifest themselves, becoming visible but incorporeal. An ectoplasm’s insubstantiality makes it very dangerous to those who depend on heavy armor for protection, because its otherworldly touch passes right through such defenses.
