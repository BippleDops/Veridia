# Old Tom Seawatch

## General Info
**Race**: Human
**Gender**: Male
**Age**: 65
**Occupation**: Lighthouse Keeper
**Location**: [[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/Locations/Whisper Rock Lighthouse]]

## Description
Old Tom Seawatch is the grizzled and cantankerous keeper of the Whisper Rock Lighthouse. He has been at his post for over 40 years, and he knows the waters around the lighthouse better than anyone.

## GM Notes
- He is a good source of information about the local area, but he is also very superstitious and is prone to exaggeration.
- He is terrified of the ghost that is said to haunt the lighthouse.
- He has a secret stash of high-quality rum that he is willing to share with those who earn his trust.
