# Storm Sphere
*4th-level, Evocation*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/storm-sphere.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A 20-foot-radius sphere of whirling air springs into existence, centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spell's duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take `2d6` bludgeoning damage. The sphere's space is difficult terrain.

Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged spell attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere. On a hit, the target takes `4d6` lightning damage.

Creatures within 30 feet of the sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) checks made to listen.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage for each of its effects increases by `d6` for each slot level above 4th.
