## Description
On his last trip to Kara-Tur, Volo (a peripatetic acquaintance of mine) happened upon several varieties of noodles far superior to those we enjoy here at home.

** Kozakuran udon,** fat, white, and long, are delicious in a broth with bits of cooked egg and onion.

**Soba,** fine, thin, vermicelli-like buckwheat noodles from Wa, are served there in broth made from, of all things, green [[Tea|tea]]!

**Bean curd noodles** from Shou Lung are made from a protein-source called “tofu,” a curd of soybean origin; they are long, fine, and nearly transparent when cooked, and quite chewy.

**Ramen,** another thin noodle, is very curly and cooks in mere minutes. We offer all of these, in convenient one-pound packages. They have been dried under carefully controlled conditions, and are guaranteed to please. All varieties are priced per pound; order in 1-pound increments only, please, as we cannot split packages. Udon, soba, bean curd, or ramen noodles: 15 gp per pound, includes shipping direct from maker.
