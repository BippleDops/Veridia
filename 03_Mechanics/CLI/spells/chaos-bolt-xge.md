# Chaos Bolt
*1st-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `2d8 + 1d6` damage. Choose one of the `d8`s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.

**Chaos Bolt**

`dice: [](chaos-bolt-xge.md#^chaos-bolt)`

| dice: d8 | Damage Type |
|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Acid |
| 2 | Cold |
| 3 | Fire |
| 4 | Force |
| 5 | Lightning |
| 6 | Poison |
| 7 | Psychic |
| 8 | Thunder |
^chaos-bolt

If you roll the same number on both `d8`s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.

A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes `d6` extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.
