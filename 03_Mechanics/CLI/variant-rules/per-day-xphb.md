# Per Day
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 372. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

If a rule says you can use something a certain number of times per day, that means you must finish a [Long Rest](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md) to use it again after you run out of uses.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties per day xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
