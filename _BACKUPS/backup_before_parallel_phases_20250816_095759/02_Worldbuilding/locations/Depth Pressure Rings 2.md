## Player-Facing Summary

Depth Pressure Rings are essential survival artifacts of the deep realms, crafted from compressed coral and infused with abyssal essence. Each ring bears intricate scrimshaw depicting pressure-adaptation sigils that glow with soft bioluminescence when the wearer approaches their depth limits. The metal feels warm to the touch despite the crushing cold of the depths, and the rings emit a faint humming that harmonizes with the wearer's heartbeat. Their presence in the deep markets anchors ongoing storylines between dive-salvage crews and offers clear advancement paths for those who dare the lightless depths.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Depth Pressure Rings as gifts from the ocean's deepest dwellers, forged in the crushing darkness where even water becomes solid under immense pressure. Deep-sea salvagers describe the telltale signs of authentic rings—the way they make water itself sing in low, resonant tones, how they cause bioluminescent creatures to form protective escorts around the wearer, and the subtle pressure changes that announce their presence to others who know the deep currents. Master divers claim that wearing multiple rings creates harmonic resonances that can open pathways through the most extreme pressure gradients.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Depth Pressure Rings to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at Depth Pressure Rings to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to Depth Pressure Rings active only during specific tides/storms.
