# Complete Temporal Mechanics System

Builds time travel rules, paradox resolution, temporal combat, chrono-corruption, anomaly events, causal loops, and time-dilated zones.

## Core Concepts
- Timeline Integrity (0–100) similar to Reality Integrity; tracked per region
- Anchors in time: Artifacts and memories that stabilize sequences
- Costs: Sanity, memories, and reality stability; Deep Mother pulses amplify consequences

## Time Travel Procedures
1) Define Intent (when/where; personal scope or world scope)
2) Pay Cost (memories, sanity loss, anchor fuel)
3) Roll Timeline Check: 1d100 vs. Integrity with modifiers from [[Complete Reality Merger System]]
4) Resolve Paradox Risk; apply loop or branch per Resolution Rules

## Paradox Resolution
- Closed Loop: Event “always happened”; memory echoes persist
- Branch: Splits local Integrity; increases merger likelihood
- Overwrite: Rewrites local history; create Palimpsest scars
- Payment: Lose or trade a key memory (see [[Memory Trading Economy System|Memory Economy]])

## Temporal Combat
- Split Initiative: Act in Past/Present/Future phases
- Delay/Precast: Bank actions into earlier/later phases
- Ghost Actions: Echo from prior loop executes unless prevented
- Counter-Paradox: Spend anchor charge to negate a future action

## Chrono-Corruption
- Symptoms: Time-sickness, identity drift, déjà vu loops
- Mechanics: Failed saves cause Long/Indefinite Madness (see [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]])
- Treatment: Memory transfusions, anchor sanctification, Deep Mother bargains

## Temporal Anomalies (d20 samples)
1 Lost hour • 2 Reverse rain • 3 Two dawns • 4 Child elder • 5 Future scar • 6 Yesterday news • 7 Late shadow • 8 Faded door • 9 Unborn echo • 10 Rust to sap • 11 Spoken tomorrow • 12 Clock melt • 13 Ancient smell • 14 Backward tide • 15 Premature ruin • 16 Posthumous visitor • 17 Looping bell • 18 Twin path • 19 Midnight at noon • 20 Leap month

## Causal Loop Puzzles
- Define Loop Nodes; require actions in non-linear order
- Provide multi-solution: brute force, memory trade, anchor ritual

## Time-Dilated Zones
- Fast/Slow/Stopped bands; pressure/altitude modifiers interact with time flow
- Long exposure: Aging/regression risks; sanity checks

Integration: [[Complete Reality Merger System]], [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]], [[Memory Trading Economy System|Memory Economy]], [[Deep Mother]].

## Player-Facing Summary

Complete Temporal Mechanics System is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Complete Temporal Mechanics System as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Complete Temporal Mechanics System.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Complete Temporal Mechanics System to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at Complete Temporal Mechanics System to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to Complete Temporal Mechanics System active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
