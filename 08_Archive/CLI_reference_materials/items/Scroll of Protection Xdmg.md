^1-creature-type

Using a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action to read the scroll creates a 5-foot Emanation originating from you. For 5 minutes, creatures of the specified type can't enter or affect anything in the area. However, if you move in such a way that a creature of the specified type would be inside the area, the effect ends.

As a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action, a creature within 5 feet of the Emanation can attempt to overcome it, which forces the creature to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the creature ceases to be affected by the Emanation.
