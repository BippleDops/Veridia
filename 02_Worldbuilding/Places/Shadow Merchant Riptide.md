## Overview
Riptide operates as one of [[Aquabyssos]]'s most dangerous information brokers, dealing in stolen memories, forged identities, and political secrets. His network spans from the deepest criminal organizations to corrupt government officials. What makes him particularly dangerous is his collection of "insurance memories" - compromising experiences extracted from powerful figures that ensure his protection and influence.

## Appearance and Demeanor
**Physical**: Tall, gaunt figure with pale skin marked by surgical scars. His eyes constantly shift color due to crystalline implants that help him process stolen memories. Wears expensive but understated clothing that conceals numerous hidden weapons and magical devices.

- Speaks in whispers, forcing others to lean in to hear him
- Frequently references conversations and events he shouldn't know about
- Touches his temple when accessing implanted memories
- Never meets in the same location twice
- Always has three escape routes planned

## Background and History
**Origins**: Former [[Memory Farmers]] apprentice who discovered the profit potential in stolen experiences  
**Corruption**: Made a pact with an entity from the shadow realm in exchange for power over memories  
**Rise to Power**: Systematically blackmailed his way into becoming one of [[Aquabyssos]]'s most feared criminals  
**Current Status**: Untouchable due to the secrets he holds, but constantly paranoid about rivals

- **Suggestion**: Implant false memories to control behavior (Warlock feature)
- **Sneak Attack**: +4d6 damage when conditions are met
- **Uncanny Dodge**: Half damage from one attack per round

- Could be redeemed through sacrifice that saves others from his fate
- Alternatively, could become increasingly corrupted and dangerous over time

> [!danger] DM Secret
> Riptide is actually the original founder of the [[Shadow Surgeons Collective]], but he had his own memories of this fact surgically removed to protect himself from retaliation. The current leadership of the Collective doesn't know their organization's true origins, and Riptide himself has forgotten why he sometimes experiences unexplained familiarity with their operations. If this truth is revealed, it could either destroy the Collective or reunite it under his leadership, dramatically shifting the criminal landscape of [[Aquabyssos]].
