# Chess
## Overview
**Price**: Various

**Weight**: -

## Description
One of the four universal [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Diversions/Games/Games|games]] (draughts, dice, and talis cards being the others), chess is the most challenging and intriguing of the four, truly the king of [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Diversions/Games/Games|games]]. It is said that kings wage wars in the summer months and practice wars with chess in the winter. Several sets are currently available from our catalog:

Made of ivory and ebony on a black and white marbled board, this is the most common set available—king, queen, priest, knight-errants, rooks, and pawns are hand-carved and the entire set is carried in a padded teak case. An old standard at 20 gp.

The main players from the Time of Troubles are represented here in finely carved hardwoods from the Loudwater area. Elminster and Cyric are kings, Mystra and Cyric’s sword the powerful queens, and the rest of the players are portrayed here. SPECIAL CLEARANCE: We’re trying to move these following a [[String|string]] of mysterious fires in the warehouse. A bargain at 15 gp!

Through special permission with the Kingdom of Cormyr, Aurora’s is proud to offer a limited-edition set commemorating the repulsion of the recent Tuigan Incursion. Cast in gilded iron and stone, the set has accurate (and flattering) portrayals of King Azoun IV, Lady Alusair, Vangerdahast, and the Horde leaders and horsemen. A phenomenal seller in the gentle homes of Cormyrean gentry, the Horde set has induced many of these lesser nobles to learn the game of kings! A special value at 25 gp.
