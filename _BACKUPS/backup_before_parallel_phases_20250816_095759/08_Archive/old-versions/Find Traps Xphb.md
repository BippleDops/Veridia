--- # Find Traps

*2nd-level, Divination* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous You sense any trap within range that is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes any object or mechanism that was created to cause damage or other danger. Thus, the spell would sense the [[Alarm Xphb or [glyph-of-warding-xphb (spells)]] spell or a mechanical pit trap, but it wouldn't reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole. This spell reveals that a trap is present but not its location. You do learn the general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense. **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 273.
