## Description
Along the northern shores of the Sea of Fallen Stars, doublets have grown to tremendous popularity. All our doublets are fronted by a row of buttons and contain comfortable joints for shoulders and elbows. The stock material for our doublets is linen, and is available in gnome (3 sp), halfling (4 sp), elf (6 sp), and human (1 gp) sizes. For velvet or silk, the cost is doubled, and for brocade it is tripled. We offer doublets in the common colors—white, beige, gray, brown, and black—for no additional cost and in red, blue, or green for the dyeing charge (2 sp).
