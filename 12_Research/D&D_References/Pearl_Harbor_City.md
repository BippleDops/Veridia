## Overview

Pearl Harbor City stands as Aquathys's primary connection to the surface world, a bustling metropolis built within a massive underwater dome that maintains variable pressure zones. The city exists in a constant state of controlled chaos as traders, smugglers, diplomats, and adventurers from both above and below the waves converge here.

#### **The Locks District**
A marvel of magical engineering, this area contains massive pressure-adjustment chambers that allow surface dwellers to safely descend and deep dwellers to ascend. Each lock takes 4 hours to fully cycle.
- **Lock Master:** [[Engineer Prisma Depthwright]]
- **Security Chief:** [[Captain Trawl Netcaster]]
- Notable: Black market pressure suits sold by [[The_Crimson_Pearl|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Pearl]]

#### **The Float Quarter**
Suspended platforms connected by bridges where air-breathing merchants can trade without full submersion. Magical air bubbles maintain breathable atmosphere.
- **Market Overseer:** [[Merchant Prince Akula]]
- **Harbor Master:** [[Old Sally Seasprayer]]
- Features: Emergency surface portals, translation services

#### **Smuggler's Reef**
Officially doesn't exist. Unofficially, everyone knows where to find anything illegal or hard to acquire. The [[Coral Throne Syndicate]] runs everything here.
- **Shadow Boss:** Whisper Jack
- **Fence:** [[The Barnacle]]
- Password: "The tide always turns"

#### **Embassy Row**
Diplomatic quarters for various factions and surface nations. Heavily warded and patrolled by [[The Depth Wardens]].
- **Surface Ambassador:** [[Lord Reginald Seaworthy]]
- **Deep Ambassador:** [[Aboleth Adjunct Yzz|Aboleth Adjunct Yzz]]
- Neutral Ground: [[The Neutral Current Tavern]]

### The Pressure Pirates
A group of raiders has been attacking ships in the transition zone between surface and city. [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]] has posted bounties.

### The Surface Plague Scare
Rumors that surface diseases are spreading through the locks. [[Dr. Siphon Gillwater|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Dr. Siphon Gillwater]] seeks adventurers to investigate.

### The Missing Shipment
A crucial delivery of [[Pressure Crystals]] from [[Luminous Hollow]] never arrived. Both [[Gareth_Ironforge|02 Worldbuilding/People/Gareth Ironforge]] and [[Master Smith Coral-Hammer]] are desperate to find it.

### Political Tensions
[[High Tidecaller Nerissa]] is visiting next week for trade negotiations. Security is tight, and assassins are rumored to be in the city.

## Player-Facing Summary

Pearl Harbor City is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Pearl Harbor City as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Pearl Harbor City.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
