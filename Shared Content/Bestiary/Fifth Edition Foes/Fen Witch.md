## Special Traits
**Death Speak:** A fen witch who knows the secret vibrations of an individual's name can speak that name as an attack. If the individual hears the fen witch speak its name, that creature must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom save or immediately drop to 0 hit points. If the save succeeds, that creature can't be affected again by the same fen witch's death speak for 24 hours. Note that the fen witch does not need to speak a language the creature understands in order to affect it; she only needs to speak its name with its secret vibrations. Other fen witches who hear the name spoken this way can't use it for their own death speak attacks (if the target's saving throw succeeds, other fen witches assume the name was vibrated incorrectly and won't copy it). Each fen witch must learn the vibrations independently by using her mind probe successfully on the target.

**Horrific Appearance:** The sight of a fen witch is so revolting that anyone who sets eyes on one within 60 feet must make a successful DC 11 Constitution save or be sickened, with effects identical to the poisoned condition, for 1 minute. Characters fighting a fen witch can instead avert their eyes at the start of their turn and take tactical disadvantage on attack rolls against the fen witch. Anyone who is surprised by a fen witch must attempt this saving throw immediately at the beginning of combat unless they can't see her for some other reason. This saving throw never needs to be attempted more than once per 24 hours. Fen witches and hags of all kinds are immune to this effect.

**Mind Probe:** As an attack, a fen witch can peer into the mind of a living creature within 60 feet in an attempt to extract the secret vibrations of the creature's name. The target resists the mental trespassing (and becomes immune to further mind probes by the same fen witch until after a long rest) with a successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. If the saving throw fails, the fen witch finds the information she sought and can use her death speak ability on a later turn. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 2 or less are immune to this ability, as are creatures that are immune to psychic damage.

**Swamp Stride:** A fen witch can move through any sort of natural difficult terrain at its normal speed while within a swamp. Magically altered terrain affects a fen witch normally.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A fen witch attacks twice with claws, or uses her mind probe or death speak ability.

**Claw:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d6+2`) slashing damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate swamp

**Organization**: Solitary or coven (2–7)

## Description
The fen witch is a creature of legend, found only in the most remote of places. It is almost always a solitary creature— they despise others of their own kind almost as much as they hate strangers in their swamps—but they sometimes band together in larger groups for mysterious, evil rituals when omens command. Occasionally, fen witches with spellcasting ability are encountered. These tend to be the leaders of their small covens, by virtue of their greater ability to inflict suffering on their cohorts.

A fen witch is thoroughly evil and malign, speaking to those she encounters only to learn the “secret vibrations” of their true names in order to use that secret against them. Fen witches rarely engage in direct combat. Instead, they rely on their mind probe and death speak abilities to slay creatures almost instantaneously and drive off the victim’s comrades (they hope) by instilling shock and fear in them. If this tactic fails, a fen witch will wade into the fight with her claws. It is not uncommon, however, for a fen witch to have trained or charmed swamp creatures such as giant crocodiles nearby that will come to her when needed.
