*1st-level, Conjuration* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour You create a 20-foot-radius [[Area of Effect Xphb of fog centered on a point within range. The [Area of Effect Xphb]] is [[Heavily Obscured Xphb. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (such as one created by [Gust of Wind Xphb]]) disperses it. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The fog's radius increases by 20 feet for each spell slot level above 1. **Classes**: [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 276.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of fog cloud xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around fog cloud xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A document has gone missing and evil awakens
