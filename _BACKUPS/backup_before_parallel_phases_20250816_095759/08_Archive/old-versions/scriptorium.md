You commission the facility's hireling to create up to fifty copies of a broadsheet, a pamphlet, or another loose-leaf paper product. The work takes 7 days and costs you 1 GP per copy. At no additional cost in time or money, the facility's hireling can distribute the paperwork to one or more locations within 50 miles of your Bastion. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 346* ## Player-Facing Summary Scriptorium is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of scriptorium as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around scriptorium. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Alliance - Manipulate succession ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Second Prophecy of Winds ## Plot Hooks - Someone is searching for information for revenge
