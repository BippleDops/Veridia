## Special Traits
**Camouflage:** Until it attacks or is set afire, a tendriculos is indistinguishable from a normal haystack.

**Swallow:** A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained. It takes 7 (`dice: 1d8+3`) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (`dice: 1d8`) acid damage automatically at the start of each of the tendriculoss turns. One Medium creature or two Small creatures can be inside the tendriculos at one time. A swallowed creature is unaffected by anything happening outside the tendriculos or by attacks from outside it, with one exception; if the tendriculos takes fire damage, creatures inside it take half as much fire damage. A swallowed creature can get out of the tendriculos by using 5 feet of movement, but only after the tendriculos is dead.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A tendriculos attacks twice with tendrils and makes one swallow attack, if it can. Having creatures grappled doesnt reduce the tendriculoss number of tendril attacks.

**Tendril:*** Melee Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d8+2`) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. A creature grappled by more than one tendril is also restrained.

**Swallow:** *Melee Attack:* automatic hit, one creature already grappled by the tendriculos at the start of the tendriculoss turn. Hit: the grappled creature is dragged to the tendriculoss mouth and swallowed (see Swallow, above).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
A tendriculos is a plant creature with an uncanny resemblance to a haystack (or in rare cases, a grassy hillock). In fact, it is a voracious predator that uses powerful tendrils to grab creatures and stuff them into its enormous maw. These creatures are the bane of remote farming communities. Any creature that wanders too near, whether it’s a sheep, a dog, a cow, a child, or a farmer, can be snatched and swallowed so quickly that even people standing nearby won’t realize that something terrible just happened behind their backs. When the disappearance is noticed, all that will be seen is a broken pitchfork or a dropped toy and a seemingly normal, harmless haystack—probably just one of many that all look identical. Most of them will be normal and harmless, but even one tendriculos hidden in a field can eat many animals and people before it’s caught—if it ever is.
