--- # Dark Gift of Sykane, the Soul Hungerer

*Charm* Sykane's gift is the power to raise the recently deceased. This dark gift allows its beneficiary to cast the [[raise-dead-xphb (spells)]] spell as an action. After it has been used three times, the dark gift vanishes. As soon as this dark gift is received, the beneficiary's eyes glow a sickly yellow until the dark gift vanishes. The beneficiary also gains the following flaw: "If I help someone, I expect payment in return." *Source: Curse of Strahd p. 192* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Dark gift of sykane the soul hungerer cos is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
