# The Festival of Rising Tides
*The Great Celebration That Unites All Depths in Harmony*

> *"In the rhythm of the tides, we find the heartbeat of our world. In the rising waters, we see our own ascension from scattered survivors to unified people. The Festival reminds us that what flows apart will always flow together again, and in that eternal cycle, we find both our history and our hope."*
> â€” High Tide-Keeper [[Coral Memoryflow]], Chief Celebrant of the Festival Council
