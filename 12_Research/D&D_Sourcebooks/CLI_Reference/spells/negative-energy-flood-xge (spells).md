--- # Negative Energy Flood

*5th-level, Necromancy* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a broken bone and a square of black silk)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous You send ribbons of negative energy at one creature you can see within range. Unless the target is undead, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking`5d12`necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target killed by this damage rises up as a [[Zombie Xmm]] at the start of your next turn. The zombie pursues whatever creature it can see that is closest to it. Statistics for the [[Zombie Xmm]] are in the Monster Manual. If you target an undead with this spell, the target doesn't make a saving throw. Instead, roll`5d12`. The target gains half the total as temporary hit points. **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 163* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Negative energy flood xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
