# Right of Might (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


## Effects
You become larger, more powerful, and far more commanding.

Your size double in all dimensions and your weight is multiplied by eight, and you increase in size by one category. Your Strength increases by 1d6 and can increase to 22. Your clothing and equipment enlarge with you and your weapons do an additional 1d4 damage, plus your new Strength modifier. You also gain advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.

You become outlined in a faint but mesmerizing aura, which gives you the ability to make powerful commands. You can magically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that canâ€™t be charmed are immune to this effect. This suggestion must me no more than one or two short sentences and must be reasonable and non-suicidal in nature. Each target may make a Wisdom saving throw to resist. This part of *right of might* works like the spell *mass suggestion.*
