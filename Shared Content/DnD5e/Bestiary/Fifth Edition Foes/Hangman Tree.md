## Special Traits
**Hang:** When a creature fails the saving throw from a constriction attack, the hangman tree hoists it off the ground by the vine around the target's neck. The creature is still grappled, and it runs out of breath and begins suffocating.

**Paralyzed by Cold:** A hangman tree is paralyzed for 1 round if it fails a Constitution saving throw after taking cold damage. The DC of the saving throw equals the spellcaster's standard DC.

**Slowed by Darkness:** Spells that engulf the hangman tree in darkness affect it as the slow spell for `dice: 1d4` rounds.

**Vines:** The vines of a hangman tree have AC 15 and 10 hit points. Only slashing damage affects them. Damage done to a vine is not subtracted from the hangman tree's overall total and does not reduce its number of vine attacks (the tree has plenty of vines to replace any that are severed).

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A hangman tree attacks four times with vines and constriction in any mix, or it can release hallucinatory spores (see below).

**Vine:** *Melee Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (`dice: 1d8+5`) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Because the tree seizes targets by the neck, a creature grappled by the hangman tree can't speak or cast spells with verbal components.

**Constriction:** *Melee Attack:* automatic hit, one creature already grappled by the hangman tree at the start of the tree's turn. Hit: 9 (`dice: 1d8+5`) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 16 Strength saving throw or be lifted off the ground and hanged (see above).

**Hallucinatory Spores:** Area Attack: automatic hit, range 50 ft. cloud centered on tree, creatures in range. Hit: creatures must make successful DC 16 Wisdom saving throws or be charmed by the tree for `dice: 2d6` minutes. Affected creatures believe the tree to be of some ordinary sort (or to be a treant or other friendly tree creature). An affected creature won't attack the hangman tree for any reason while charmed. A successful saving throw renders a creature immune to this tree's hallucinatory spores for 24 hours.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate and warm forests

**Organization**: Solitary or pair

## Description
The hangman tree looks like any other tree in its part of the forest. It is always a broadleaf hardwood; hangman trees never live among conifers or trees with needle-shaped leaves. Hidden among the tree’s branches and leaves are its ropelike appendages that it uses to trap and strangle prey.

Strangled victims are hoisted high into the branches and then lowered into the creature’s “mouth:” an opening at the top of the trunk through which the tree eats. The tree also appears to have a horizontal scar in its bark near the ground, but close inspection reveals it to be an orifice through which the tree expels bones, gear, and other undigestible bits of the creatures it eats.

Being plants, hangman trees are not subject to any of the emotions or sentiment of humanoids. They are not malicious killers, but they place no value on animal life beyond the food it provides. Most of them believe that animals (including humanoids) don’t actually feel pain, so they see no reason to be gentle with their food.
