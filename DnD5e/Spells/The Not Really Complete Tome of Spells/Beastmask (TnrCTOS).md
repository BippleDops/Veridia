# Beastmask (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *illusion*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a wooden mask carved to look like the animal)

**Duration**: 12 hours


## Effects
You or one willing creature is made to look, feel, sound, and smell exactly like a particular species of beast or monstrosity that has an Intelligence of 4 or lowerâ€”but only to other members of that species. Mem-bers of closely related species are also fooled; for instance, a dog mask will also fool wolves and death dogs, and a bear mask will also fool giant bears and owlbears. This spell does not give you any ability to communicate with that animal, however.
