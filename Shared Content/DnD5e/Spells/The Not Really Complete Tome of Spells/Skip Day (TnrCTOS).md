# Skip Day (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *9th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (10-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S

## Effects
You and up to 8 others within range are instantly transported 24 hours into the future. Unwilling people may make a Charisma saving throw to resist. To outsiders, it appears that you simply disappear.

You appear in the exact spot you disap-peared in. If there is something in that spot, you appear within 5 feet of it. There is no guarantee that this area will be any safer than the one you left.
