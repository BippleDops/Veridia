*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 96*  

A Lightning Cannon is a small, bronze cannon inlaid with arcane runes and mounted on a heavy tripod device. It launches balls of crackling electricity. Aiming a Lightning Cannon requires the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action, then a crew member can take the Lightning Ball action.
