# Economic Warfare

*The conquest without swords - Aethermoor's sovereignty hangs in the balance*

## Quest Overview
The [[Goldspire Confederacy]] is orchestrating Aethermoor's economic collapse to force annexation. With [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Zephyr Goldwhisper]] as their primary agent and multiple crises weakening the kingdom, the party must expose and counter this bloodless invasion while navigating international politics and moral compromises.

## Quest Giver
Multiple possible sources:
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Sir Marcus Dawnforge]]** discovers financial irregularities in Order supplies
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]]** notices foreign interference in black markets
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]** secretly requests help with mounting debts
- **Anonymous note** revealing Confederate plans (from guilty [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Zephyr Goldwhisper]])

## Background
The Goldspire Confederacy has been systematically:
- Buying up Aethermoor's debts through shell companies
- Creating artificial supply shortages
- Preparing "humanitarian aid" with sovereignty-surrendering conditions
- Building invasion fleet disguised as relief vessels
- Developing crystal-nullification weapons

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. Expose the Confederate economic manipulation
2. Prevent or negotiate the debt crisis
3. Decide [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Zephyr Goldwhisper]]'s fate
4. Stop or redirect Operation Goldfall

### Optional Objectives
- Turn Zephyr into a double agent
- Steal null-technology from [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Goldspire Port]]
- Rally international support against Confederacy
- Create economic counter-offensive
- Expose or protect Confederate spy network

## Key NPCs Involved
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Zephyr Goldwhisper]]** - Confederate spy with growing conscience
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]** - Desperate ruler considering surrender
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Sir Marcus Dawnforge]]** - Organizes resistance through underground networks
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]]** - Controls black market, key to economic independence
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Korvin Blacktide]]** - Potential unlikely ally against Confederacy
- **Trade Prince Aurelius Gilt** - Confederate leader in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Goldspire Port]]

## Investigation Threads

### Follow the Money
- Shell companies traced to Confederate banks
- Suspicious trading patterns in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]]
- Order supply contracts with inflated prices
- Noble debts being consolidated by single creditor

### The Spy Network
- Zephyr's shop contains coded communications
- Confederate agents embedded in major guilds
- Refugee quarter in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Goldspire Port]] recruiting dissidents
- Admiral Brass Hookhand's fleet movements

### The Null Weapons
- Technology that completely neutralizes crystal energy
- Weapons capable of rendering Aethermoor defenseless
- Plans to deploy if crystal corruption spreads
- Secret testing on confiscated Aethermoor artifacts

## Paths to Resolution

### The Diplomatic Solution
- Negotiate directly with Trade Prince Aurelius Gilt
- Offer controlled crystal trade in exchange for debt relief
- Propose Aethermoor as buffer state against [[Aquabyssos]]
- Risk: Partial loss of sovereignty

### The Economic Counter
- Unite [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Merchant Princes]] against foreign takeover
- Use [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]]'s network for smuggling operation
- Create alternative trade routes through [[Aquabyssos]]
- Risk: Economic war escalation

### The Espionage Option
- Turn Zephyr and feed false intelligence
- Infiltrate [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Goldspire Port]] to steal null-technology
- Sabotage Confederate fleet preparations
- Risk: International incident if caught

### The Revolutionary Path
- Expose everything publicly, cause popular uprising
- Default on all foreign debts, economic isolation
- Nationalize crystal production and trade
- Risk: Complete economic collapse

### The Dark Alliance
- Ally with [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Korvin Blacktide]] against Confederacy
- Threaten to spread corruption internationally
- Use Green Death threat as leverage
- Risk: Becoming the villain

## Moral Complexities

### Zephyr's Dilemma
Zephyr has genuinely grown fond of several Aethermoor citizens and is increasingly conflicted. They possess:
- Complete Confederate invasion plans
- Null bomb locations in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]]
- Codes for Confederate spy network
- Personal friendship with Trade Prince

### The Refugee Question
Many Aethermoor refugees in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Goldspire Port]] support annexation, believing it's better than corruption. They're not wrong - Confederate rule might save lives.

### The Economic Reality
Aethermoor genuinely cannot pay its debts without Confederate help. Default means:
- No foreign trade
- Medical supply shortages
- Famine in urban areas
- Military collapse

## DM Secrets
> [!warning] The Ticking Clock
> - 10 days until debt payment due
> - 7 days until Confederate fleet "training exercise"
> - 5 days until null bombs activate if triggered
> - 3 days until Zephyr must report or be suspected

> [!danger] The Bigger Picture
> The Confederacy isn't entirely evil - they genuinely believe Aethermoor will fall to corruption and want to preserve what they can. Trade Prince Aurelius Gilt lost family to a similar magical catastrophe and sees this as prevention.

> [!info] The Hidden Option
> If the party can prove they're solving the crystal crisis (cure from Green Death quest, Aquabyssos alliance, or Shard unification), the Confederacy might back down and offer genuine partnership instead of takeover.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Economic Warfare as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Economic Warfare.

## Adventure Hooks

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
