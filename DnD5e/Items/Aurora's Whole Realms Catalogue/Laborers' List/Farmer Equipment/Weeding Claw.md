## Description
This small metal claw should not be passed over as a useless item— in fact, I knew one farmer who claimed to have killed a shambling mound with one. (He always tended toward hyperbole.) Held in hand, this claw (7 sp) easily removes weeds, without filling one’s nails with dirt. The weeding claw can also fit on the end of our claw pole (6 sp) and be used as a [[Rake|rake]].
