A supernatural mystery quest centered on Whisper Island, a small landmass off the coast of Aethermoor where strange phenomena reporteded. Ships approaching the island report hearing voices of the dead, and several vessels have disappeared entirely. Local authorities are baffled, and maritime trade is beginning to suffer as captains refuse to sail the affected routes. Nevertheless, ## The Mystery

Whisper Island has always been uninhabited and unremarkable, but recent changes have made it a source of terror for sailors. Witnesses report:
- Voices of deceased loved ones calling from the island
- Ships' compasses spinning wildly near the island
- Crew members acting strangely after hearing the whispers
- Time distortions where hours pass in minutes or vice versa
- Missing ships with no wreckage found ## Quest Structure
