# Ring of Evasion
*Ring, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/ring-of-evasion.webp#right)

This ring has 3 charges, and it regains `d3` expended charges daily at dawn. When you fail a Dexterity saving throw while wearing the ring, you can take a [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules)]] to expend 1 charge to succeed on that save instead.
