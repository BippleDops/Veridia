# Chilling Scythe (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a fragment of bone)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You create an oversized but weightless scythe made of glowing, blue-black force. You may choose to wield it or give it to someone else to wield. The scythe does 2d8 + the wielderâ€™s Strength modifier in slashing damage, plus 1d8 necrotic damage. If the target is undead it takes an additional 4d8 necrotic damage, even if it is normally im-mune or resistant to necrotic damage, and it must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. The scythe is a two-handed weapon with reach.
