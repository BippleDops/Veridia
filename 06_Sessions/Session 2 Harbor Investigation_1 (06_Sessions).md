- -- # Session 2: Harbor Investigation * The Sunken Conspiracy - Uncovering Smuggling Operations* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements * 20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Session Overview **Expected Duration**: 4-5 hours **Party Level**: 1st-2nd level **Adventure Type**: Social Investigation, Political Intrigue, Light Combat **Key Themes**: Factional politics, corruption, moral ambiguity, deeper mysteries ### Continuing from Session 1 The session begins immediately after the previous cliffhanger: > The young messenger's words hang in the water-heavy air: "*Golden Current* is under attack right now!" Through the office's crystal viewport, you can see lights moving erratically in the harborâ€”the telltale glow of magical combat reflecting off the sea floor. **Immediate Decision Required**: How does the party respond to this crisis? **Options and Consequences**: 1. **Rush to help**: Arrive during active combat, chance to catch attackers
2. **Gather information first**: Miss the action but arrive with better intelligence
3. **Split the party**: Some go, some stayâ€”divided resources but multiple advantages ### The Active Crime Scene **Location**: Pier 12, where the merchant vessel *Golden Current* is moored. **Situation on Arrival**: - **Combat in Progress**: If party rushed (less than 10 minutes)
- **Aftermath Investigation**: If party prepared first (15+ minutes) ### Option A: Arriving During Combat **The Scene**: > Water swirls violently around Pier 12 as shapes move beneath the surface. The *Golden Current*, a three-masted vessel designed for both surface and shallow underwater travel, lists heavily to one side. Pressure-suited figures are loading cargo from the ship onto a sleek, unmarked submersible. Sparks of magical energy light up the water as the ship's defenders fight back. **Combat Encounter: Smuggler Raid in Progress** **Enemies**:


**Summary**: Option A: Arriving During Combat **The Scene**: > Water swirls violently around Pier 12 as shapes move beneath the surface. The *Golden Current*, a three-masted vessel designed for both surface and shallow underwater travel, lists heavily to one side. Pressure-suited figures are loading cargo from the ship onto a sleek, unmarked submersible. Sparks of magical energy light up the water as the ship's defenders fight back. **Combat Encounter: Smuggler Raid in Progress** **Enemies**: - Key information at a glance.
- **Smuggler Lieutet** (use Bandit Captain stats): - Wears advanced pressure suit (+2 AC underwater) - Armed with *Harpoon of Returning* and *Crossbow of Stunning* - Tactical leader, calls out orders - **4 Smuggler Raiders** (use Bandit stats with modifications): - Each has basic pressure adaptations (gills, webbed hands) - Armed with underwater crossbows and nets - Focus on cargo, not killing unless necessary - **2 Trained Sharks** (use Reef Shark stats): - Wearing crude armor (+1 AC) - Follow simple commands from smugglers - Attack anyone who threatens the operation **Environmental Factors**:
- **Multi-level Combat**: Action occurs both in air pockets and underwater
- **Ship Interior**: Cramped conditions, cargo obstacles
- **Pressure Zones**: Moving between areas requires adaptation checks
- **Innocent Bystanders**: Ship's crew (5 sailors) caught in crossfire **Tactical Map Description**:
- **The Golden Current**: 80-foot merchant vessel, partially submerged
- **Pier 12**: Coral platform with air pockets and water channels - **Smuggler Submersible**: Sleek, fast vessel positioned for quick escape
- **Cargo Area**: Crates and barrels provide cover but can be destroyed
- **Water Channels**: Allow underwater movement between areas **Smuggler Tactics**:
- **Priority**: Complete cargo transfer, then escape
- **Combat Style**: Hit-and-run, use water for cover
- **Escape Plan**: Submersible can leave in 3 rounds if unopposed
- **Prisoner Taking**: Will grab civilians or party members if possible **Party Options**:
- **Direct Combat**: Fight the raiders head-on
- **Protect Civilians**: Focus on ship's crew safety
- **Prevent Escape**: Try to stop or disable the submersible
- **Gather Intelligence**: Attempt to capture smugglers alive **Combat Complications** (roll d6 each round): 1. Nevertheless, **Pressure Breach**: Area floods, requires swimming
2. **Cargo Collapse**: Flying debris (Dex save DC 15 or 1d6 damage)
3. **Ship Listing**: Difficult terrain as vessel tilts further
4. **Innocent in Danger**: Crew member needs immediate rescue
5. **Reinforcements**: Two more smugglers arrive via pressure tube
6. **Equipment Failure**: Someone's pressure adaptation malfunctions ### Option B: Arriving After the Attack **The Scene**: > The *Golden Current* sits dead in the water, listing badly to starboard. Harbor Guard patrol boats circle like sharks, their searchlights cutting through the murky water. Bodies float in the brineâ€”some human, some something else. The acrid smell of burned kelp and spilled cargo hangs heavy in the artificial atmosphere of the pier. **Investigation Opportunities**: #### Examining the Ship **Investigation DC 15**:
- Cargo hold has been systematically searched
- Attackers knew exactly what they were looking for
- Crew place up significant resistance before being overwhelmed
- Ship's manifest alterededâ€”recent erasures visible **Medicine DC 14** (examining casualties):
- Crew members were incapacitated, not killed when possible
- Weapon wounds match crossbow bolts and pressure-based weapons
- One body shows signs of memory modification magic **Arcana DC 16** (magical traces):
- Transmutation magic used to alter ship's appearance
- Divination magic employed to locate specific cargo
- Necromancy traces suggest memory extraction from survivors #### Interviewing Survivors **First Mate Sarah Ironwind** (use Scout stats): - **Condition**: Wounded but conscious


**Summary**: Interviewing Survivors **First Mate Sarah Ironwind** (use Scout stats): - **Condition**: Wounded but conscious - Key information at a glance.
- **Personality**: Tough, angry, protective of crew
- **What She Knows**: > "They came up through the water like something out of the deep trenches. Not random piratesâ€”they had a list. Kept asking about the 'Meridian shipment' and 'pressure adaptation equipment.' When Captain Torres refused to talk, they... Did something to his head. He just went blank, started answering their questions like he was their crew." **Ship's Engineer Brass Cogwright** (use Commoner stats):
- **Condition**: Hiding in engine compartment, traumatized
- **Personality**: Nervous, technical-minded
- **What He Knows**: > "That submersibleâ€”I've never seen anything like it. Moved like it was alive, and the engine barely made a sound. But I caught a glimpse of the registration numbers before they painted over them. Started with 'AQ-7'â€”that's deep research vessel classification." **Cabin Boy Tim Scaleless** (use Commoner stats, age 14):
- **Condition**: Unharmed but frightened
- **Personality**: Young, observant, wants to help
- **What He Knows**: > "The leaderâ€”she kept checking this brass compass that pointed weird. Not north, but... Down. And she knew things about our cargo that wasn't on the manifest. Knew about the special passenger we were supposed to pick up in three days." ### Intelligence Gathered from Either Scenario **Cargo Stolen**: 1. **Pressure Adaptation Equipment**: Advanced breathing apparatus and pressure suits
2. **Memory Crystals**: Used for storing and transferring experiences
3. **Navigation Charts**: Deep-sea routes to restricted areas
4. **Diplomatic Pouches**: Sealed correspondence between Parliament and unknown parties
5. **Special Components**: Unidentified mechanical parts with magical augmentation **Pattern Analysis** (Investigation DC 17): - Attackers had detailed inside information
- They're building toward something requiring these specific resources
- The "special passenger" reference connects to future operations
- Memory modification suggests they're hiding their tracks systematically ### Harbor Master's Emergency Response **Location**: Harbor Master's office, now bustling with activity. **Luna Freedrift's Reaction**: > Luna looks up from multiple charts and documents, her sea-green eyes bright with anger and determination. "Four ships now, and they're getting bolder. This attack in port means they have protectionâ€”someone high up is covering for them." **New Information Luna Provides**:
1. **Political Pressure**: Parliament representatives are demanding immediate action
2. **Military Response**: Admiral Thorne Blackwater wants to declare martial law
3. **Economic Impact**: Trade routes are closing, affecting the entire region
4. **Intelligence Sources**: Her network has identified potential conspiracy members
5. **Time Constraint**: Parliament emergency session called for tomorrow **Luna's Dilemma**: > "I can give you official authority to investigate, but that means working within the systemâ€”and the system is compromised. Or you can work unofficially, with my resources but without legal protection. Either way, we're running out of time." ### Meeting Parliament Representative **Senator Marius Deepcurrent** (use Noble stats with adaptations): - **Race**: Human (heavily adaptedâ€”translucent skin, enlarged eyes)
- **Appearance**: Elegant robes, multiple jewelry pieces indicating status
- **Personality**: Intelligent, politically savvy, genuinely concerned about crisis
- **Goals**: Find solution that doesn't damage Aquabyssos's reputation **Senator's Arrival**: > A pressure tube hisses to a stop outside the harbor office, and Senator Marius Deepcurrent emerges with a small retinue of guards and advisors. His translucent skin shows the pulsing of his modified circulatory system, and his enlarged eyes take in everything with calculating intelligence. **Senator's Proposition**: > "Harbor Master Freedrift, I understand you've been investigating these attacks with... Unofficial assistance. The Parliament is prepared to grant these individuals Temporary Investigative Authority, but we need results within 48 hours. Admiral Blackwater is pushing for a military response that could have serious diplomatic consequences." **Formal Authority Benefits**:
- **Legal Protection**: Cannot be arrested by local authorities
- **Resource Access**: Official vessels, equipment, personnel
- **Information Network**: Access to Parliament intelligence files
- **Diplomatic Immunity**: Protection when dealing with other factions **Formal Authority Drawbacks**:
- **Oversight**: Must report progress regularly
- **Restrictions**: Cannot use illegal methods or work with criminals
- **Political Targets**: Conspiracy knows they're officially sanctioned
- **Responsibility**: Failures reflect on Parliament's competence **Alternative: Underground Network**: Luna offers introduction to the Free Current resistance: > "If you work with my network, you'll have different resourcesâ€”people the conspiracy doesn't know about, safe houses they can't find, information they can't intercept. But if you're caught, I can't protect you officially." ### The Choice of Paths This decision affects the rest of the session and future sessions: #### Parliament Intelligence Bureau **Location**: The Crystal Archive, deep beneath Parliament complex. **Chief Analyst Nerida Saltweave** (use Mage stats): - **Race**: Merfolk (Parliament loyalist)
- **Personality**: Methodical, suspicious, protective of state secrets
- **Goals**: Find threat to Parliament authority, maintain security **The Intelligence Files**: > The Crystal Archive stores information in living memory coralsâ€”organisms that record and replay experiences. Chief Analyst Saltweave guides you to a restricted section where classified files pulse with bioluminescent warnings. **Information Available** (requires Persuasion DC 16 or official authority): 1. **Marcus Shadowfin's File**: - Former Harbor Authority second-in-command - Dismissed for selling security information - Has connections to radical political groups - Suspected of organizing anti-Parliament cells - Last known location: Deep Current Territories 2. **Ficial Intelligence**: - Large gold transfers to shell companies - Payments traced to off-shore accounts - Connection to surface world weapons dealers - Funding sources include stolen goods fencing 3. **Personnel Security Alerts**: - Several Harbor Authority employees under investigation - Parliament members receiving threats - Increase in adapted-human separatist activity - Reports of surface world infiltrators **The Restricted File** (requires additional Persuasion DC 20): > Nerida's expression becomes grave as she accesses a memory coral that pulses deep red. "This is classified at the highest levels. Three months ago, we intercepted communications suggesting a coordinated attack on Parliament leadership. The operation was code-named 'Deep Liberation' and involved stealing specific resources for an unspecified 'conversion process.'" **Deep Liberation Intelligence**:
- **Primary Goal**: Overthrow current Parliament structure
- **Method**: Create crisis that justifies radical response
- **Timeline**: Major operation planned for next new moon
- **Leadership**: "The Commodore" and unknown surface world contacts
- **Resources Needed**: Memory manipulation technology, pressure adaptation equipment, modified vessels #### Official Resources Provided **Equipment Access**: - **Parliament Seal**: Grants access to restricted areas

- **Appearance**: Shrouded figure whose features shift like water
- **Personality**: Paranoid, knowledgeable, speaks in riddles
- **Goals**: Protect Free Current operations, gather intelligence **The Underground Meeting**: > Luna leads you through a maze of abandoned tunnels that smell of decay and old secrets. The meeting chamber is carved from living rock, walls lined with bioluminescent fungi that pulse in warning patterns. Agent Whisper emerges from shadows that seem deeper than they should be. **Whisper's Information**: > "The current runs deep, and the shadows have eyes. What you seek swims in darker waters than Parliament imagines. The Commodore is a puppet, and his strings reach to places that should not exist." **Intelligence from the Underground** (decoded from Whisper's cryptic speech): 1. **The Real Conspiracy**: - Parliament members are involved at the highest levels - Surface world agents are manipulating events - The ship thefts are preparation for something larger - Memory modification useds on Parliament officials 2. **Safe Houses and Resources**: - Hidden facilities throughout the harbor - Network of adapted humans who oppose Parliament - Access to illegal magical items and services - Underground smuggling routes to escape if needed 3. **Active Operations**: - Several Parliament members under surveillance - Counter-intelligence efforts to protect Free Current - Plans to expose corruption publicly - Preparation for potential civil war **Underground Resources Provided**: **Equipment Access**:

- **Personality**: Smooth, professional, hiding nervousness
- **Role**: Manages accounts for wealthy clients, some legitimate **The Banking Investigation**: > The Silverscale Banking House exudes wealth and respectability. Carved pearl walls reflect soft light from bioluminescent chandeliers, and the air carries the scent of expensive incense meant to mask the briny deep-water smell. **Approaching the Bank**:
- **Official Path**: Use Parliamentary authority to demand records
- **Underground Path**: Infiltrate or bribe employees for information
- **Social Path**: Convince banker to cooperate voluntarily **Official Approach** (DC 15 Intimidation or show authority): **Success**: Titus reluctantly provides information
**Failure**: Bank security is alerted, complications arise **Underground Approach** (DC 16 Stealth and Sleight of Hand):
**Success**: Gain access to records without detection
**Failure**: Trigger security wards, potential combat **Social Approach** (DC 18 Persuasion):
**Success**: Titus voluntarily shares information and offers help
**Failure**: Titus becomes suspicious and alerts contacts **Ficial Records Discovered**: 1. **Shell Company Transactions**: - "Deep Current Enterprises": Large deposits from unknown sources - "Pressure Dynamics Ltd": Payments for equipment and services - "Meridian Consulting": Retainer payments to various individuals 2. **Suspicious Patterns**: - Payments always made just before ship disappearances - Money traced to surface world precious metal exchanges - Regular transfers to accounts in neutral territories - Recent large withdrawal for "operational expenses" 3. **Client Information** (if very successful): - Account holder: Marcus Shadowfin (using assumed name) - Secondary authorization: Unknown Parliament member (encrypted ID) - Next scheduled transaction: Tomorrow (500,000 gold pieces) - Account balance: Enough to fund a small war **Titus's Revelation** (if approached socially): > "Look, I've been in banking long enough to know when money smells wrong. These accountsâ€”they're connected to people who create other people disappear. I keep records off the official books, insurance you might say. But if this goes dire, I need protection." #### Discovering the Traitor **The Investigation** reveals that payments are authorized by a Parliament member, but identity is encrypted. **Skill Challenge: Breaking the Encryption** - **Investigation DC 18**: Analyze the encryption pattern
- **Arcana DC 16**: Understand magical components of the code
- **History DC 15**: Recognize historical cipher techniques
- **3 successes needed before 2 failures** **Success**: Identity revealed as **Senator Octavius Darkwater** **Failure**: Encryption triggers alert to the traitor **Senator Octavius Darkwater** (use Noble stats with spy abilities):
- **Race**: Human (adapted for extreme depths)
- **Position**: Parliament Defense Committee Chair
- **Personality**: Charismatic, radical, believes ends justify means
- **Motivation**: Thinks Parliament is too weak, wants stronger Aquabyssos #### Confronting or Surveilling the Traitor **Option A: Direct Confrontation** - Higher risk but potentially higher reward
- Could expose entire conspiracy
- Risk of violence or political scandal
- Requires careful handling of political implications **Option B: Surveillance** - Gather evidence of illegal activities
- Follow contacts to larger conspiracy
- Risk of discovery and retaliation
- Opportunity to prevent next operation **Senator Darkwater's Location**: Parliament Building, heavily secured. **Surveillance Opportunities**:
- **Evening Social Events**: Senator attends high-society gatherings
- **Committee Meetings**: Accessible to those with Parliamentary authority
- **Private Residence**: Heavily guarded estate in Noble Quarter
- **Secret Meeting Sites**: Intelligence suggests regular clandestine meetings #### Tracking Senator Darkwater **Time**: Late evening, following surveillance or confrontation. **Location**: The Deep Currentâ€”a natural underwater canyon system outside Port Meridian's main boundaries. **The Journey**: > Following Senator Darkwater's submersible requires staying far enough back to avoid detection while close enough to maintain visual contact. The Deep Current is a maze of thermal vents, underwater geysers, and strange rock formations that seem to shift when you're not looking directly at them. **Environmental Challenges**:
- **Navigation**: DC 15 Survival checks to avoid getting lost
- **Pressure Changes**: Depth increases rapidly, requires adaptation
- **Thermal Vents**: Damage if approached too closely
- **Strange Currents**: create stealth more difficult **The Secret Base**: > In a massive underwater cavern, illuminated by bioluminescent organisms and artificial lighting, you see the impossible: a fleet of modified ships, some you recognize as the missing vessels, others unknown. Crews of adapted humans work alongside strange, mechanical creatures, loading cargo and making modifications to vessel hulls. ### The Conspiracy Revealed **Base Description**: - **Modified Ships**: The missing vessels, altered with unknown technology
- **Construction Areas**: Building new submersibles with surface world technology
- **Holding Pens**: Captured crew members, some appearing blank-eyed

- **Goals**: Unknown but clearly not aligned with Aquabyssos interests **The Meeting Overheard** (Stealth DC 18 to avoid detection): > "The ships are ready for the next phase," reports Shadowfin. "Memory modification of the crews is completeâ€”they'll serve without question." > > "excellent," replies Senator Darkwater. "The Parliament emergency session tomorrow will provide the perfect opportunity. One more incident, properly staged, and they'll beg for military protection."
> The surface agent's voice carries a mechanical echo: "My employers are satisfied with progress. The technology transfer is proceeding on schedule. Soon, the surface will have access to pressure adaptation technology, and Aquabyssos will have the weapons needed for expansion." **Intelligence Gathered**:
1. **The Plan**: Create false-flag operation to justify martial law
2. **The Timeline**: Major operation tomorrow during Parliament session 3. **The Goal**: Technology exchange between surface and Aquabyssos
4. **The Method**: Modified crews under mental control

2. Parliament infiltration confirmed
3. Surface world involvement exposed
4. Timeline for major operation (tomorrow)
5. Location of modified fleet and crews **Resources Available**: - **Official Path**: Can report to loyal Parliament members
