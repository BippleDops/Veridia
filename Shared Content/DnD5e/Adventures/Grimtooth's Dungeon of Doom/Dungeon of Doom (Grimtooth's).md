# Dungeon of Doom (Grimtooth's)
## Introduction
### Introduction
![[xptkoyyh.csr.png|Introduction|300]]
[[xptkoyyh.csr.png|open outside]]

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> Salutations, fellow character crunching, creation compacting, creature crippling, cognoscenti of chaos. It is time once again to enter that entertaining world of mind boggling mayhem that makes the operation and maintenance of dungeons such an attractive career. Come with me once more into the world of traps!
> 
> Over the last fifth of a century I've been been scouring the known (and to a degree unknown) world to supply you with individual traps. Each has been attractive in it's own charmingly gruesome way. They have, however, been like a double handful of unset gem stones. They flash with brilliance, but they are alone; isolated from the striking settings that will enhance their natural diabolical luster.
> 
> In previous tomes you have come to en joy the thrill of knowing in advance just what cleverness the hapless boobs that blunder into your arrays of my devices of doom will need just to survive. But in the end you have had to fall back on th􀁮 usual run-of-the-mill cast of monsters, ores, golems, and such like less clever, and more fallible minions. This will change.
> 
> After years of globe trotting for your edification and delight I have finally unearthed (literally) a true gem. Yes, after all this time of serving you tidbits piecemeal I now can offer you a feast. Built from the ground up, a dungeon consisting entirely of TRAPS!
> 
> Once characters enter here they will be thrown back on that one resource that you and I know they possess in shortest supply: their wits. Rest assured you can use each trap and mechanism separately to punch up the sagging "kill ratio" of your local family maze or warren, but for the first time ever you will now have access to a true TRAPS DUNGEON, that in and of itself is complete and fully functional.
> 
> As l am eager to begin, let me just step aside and bid you enter into the wonderful world of the Ancient Wizard Evinrood, and his intricate Tomb.

## Some Background...
> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The search for the perfect traps dungeon is rooted in antiquity. It involves a duel between two of the greatest wizards of their time. A time so long ago that all records have been lost. Until now. (If we kept records on something other than vellum scrolls and other such primitive materials we would probably find out that the" a time lost in antiquity' is in reality something like two or three hundred years ago.)
> 
> On a cliff overlooking the sea, I discovered ( with very little help) a great Capstone. Upon closer inspection it was found to be covered with an inscription. The letters that made up the message were so faded that it was only with great care that the legend was deciphered.
> 
> It read as follows:

> [!QUOTE]+ Read-Aloud
> This was the Final resting place of Evinrood the Water Wizard. He did battle with Selgolub the Master of Deamons inthe yearoftheBitter Wyvern. He failed to over throwSelgolub andwas Accursed. Herein lies the master Wizard; Savior of Karthaki, friend of the dwarves, and kobolds, Master of the Elements. Here too lies his greatest treasure. Disturb this slumber at your peril.

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> After prolonged research more was found about the legendary Evinrood by consulting an archivist sorcerer who's specialty is restoring ancient records. (This is a wizard who spends his time restoring old scrolls hoping one will contain a map to some old castle site, dungeon·, or tomb. These he sells to hapless fools through a" broker". This is considerably safer than exploring them himself.)
> 
> It seems Evinrood's chief claim to fame was a feat of conjuration he performed at the behest of Shillary Lockwood, Chateline Of Karthaki. (As with all wizards it was more than likely a large "gold" behest.) During the third year of the Reign of Terror, brought on by the Death Empress of Khazan, attacks into the reign aroundKarthaki were rife. Evinrood destroyed one such expeditionary forceout ofKharkadan. He used his control of the earth elementals, and the aid of the dwarves and kobolds to drive the horde to the banks of the river Dajja. There on the banks of the river he summoned a myriad of water elementals. The attacking horde was dragged into the river and consumed by the elemental force. Thus ended the Battle of Three Plains. (The archivist/wizard will gladly sell you a map to the site for a" small fee, so good luck, you'll need it.")

## Mechanics
In this book, there will be many comments about the li.keli hood (usually given in both percentages and Level - e.g. I 0% (LI) chance of making it across the pit) of success or failure. The percent chance is a straightforward and generic way to detennine the odds. You, as the gamemaster, can either use it directly by rolling a 100-sided Zocchihedron or two IO-sided dice, or you can use the numbers to come up with whatever "saving throw" fits into your own game system. Naturall1 this is modified by any bonuses that a player has for that particular activity. The level number is just another comparison of the difficulty of an action.

Leyel l means anyone but a raw beginning character should have little trouble with this. 

Level 2 means that beginners should experience a serious risk offa ilure, and even experienced characters should have a chance to miss. 

Level 3 is seriously dangerous to beginning characters, experienced characters should be a little nervous, and even mega-characters should have at least a possibility of missing. Level 4 should be almost out of the question for beginners, dangerous to experienced characters, and somewhat dangerous to the mega-characters. 

And so on. Remember in all cases, that although Grim tooth has set this adventure up for you, YOU are now the gamemaster and can adjust things as you think best.

There are also references to the amount of damage that occurs, listed as the number of `dice: D6` (the universal six sided die) that could be rolled to detennine the number of hits to be taken off of however many hits it takes to killthe characters. If this is not appropriate for your game system, you can come up with your own numbers for one of these, and then use these numbers for comparison.

We have also included a chart in the back of this book listing some suggested numbers for several game systems. These numbers are not authorized by any particular company, but have merely been suggested by one of our playtesters.
