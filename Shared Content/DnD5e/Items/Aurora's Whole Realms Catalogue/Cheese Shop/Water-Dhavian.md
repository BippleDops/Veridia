## Description
Also called eyed cheese, holed cheese, or arrow-shot, this pale cheese has a sharp, tangy bite which would make it instantly recognizable without its unique appearance. A popular and common cheese in the City of Splendors, it is found both in the most common bars and on the richest tables of the nobles. Remember, I sell cheese by weight, not volume, so you arenâ€™t paying for the holes! Available in 1 lb wheels (4 sp) or 100 lbs oval wheys (35 gp)
