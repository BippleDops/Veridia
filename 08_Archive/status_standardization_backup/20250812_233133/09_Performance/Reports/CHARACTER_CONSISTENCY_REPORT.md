# Character Consistency Report
*Comprehensive Analysis of Character Names, Relationships, Locations, and Power Levels*

**Generated**: 2025-08-12  
**Analysis Scope**: Obsidian TTRPG Vault Experimental

---

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes character consistency across the TTRPG vault, identifying naming conflicts, relationship inconsistencies, location contradictions, and power level discrepancies. The analysis reveals a systematic pattern of stub files creating naming confusion alongside well-developed character profiles.

### Key Findings:
- **327+ character files** identified in People directory
- **Multiple naming variations** for the same characters
- **Stub files creating confusion** with canonical character versions
- **Strong relationship consistency** in well-developed characters
- **Generally consistent power scaling** within established hierarchies

---

## 1. Identity Consistency Analysis

### 1.1 Major Naming Inconsistencies

#### **Critical Issues**

**Marina Red Tide Coralheart Variants:**
- `Marina Red Tide Coralheart - Aquabyssos.md` (fully developed, Aquabyssos-specific)
- `Marina-Red-Tide-Coralheart.md` (well-developed, surface-world focused)
- **Status**: Two distinct character versions with different backgrounds
- **Recommendation**: Establish canonical version or clarify as alternate timeline

**Admiral Cassandra Stormwind Variants:**
- `Admiral Cassandra Stormwind.md` (fully developed, 200+ lines)
- `Admiral Lady Cassandra Stormwind.md` (stub file, TODO sections)
- **Status**: Clear canonical vs stub distinction
- **Recommendation**: Delete or redirect stub file

**Captain Thaddeus Variations:**
- `Captain Thaddeus Blackwater.md` (well-developed explorer character)
- `Captain Thaddeus Stormwright.md` (mentioned in portrait prompts)
- **Status**: Potential duplicate or separate characters
- **Recommendation**: Verify if these are intended as different characters

**Lord/Duke Blackwater Confusion:**
- `Duke Aldric Blackwater.md` (stub file)
- `Duke Blackwater's Estate.md` (location/character confusion)
