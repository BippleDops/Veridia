# Bolt of Glory (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a small amber rod bound with bronze)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You fire a burst of energy from the Positive plane at one target you can see within range. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 10d10 radiant damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one. Celestials are not affected by this spell and fiends and undead are at disadvantage on the saving throw.
