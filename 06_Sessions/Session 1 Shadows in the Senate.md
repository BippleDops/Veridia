- -- # Session 1: Shadows in the Senate * [[The Shadow [Conspiracy Investigation]] Begins* > [!info] [[Session Overview > **Duration**: 4-6 hours
> **[Level Range]]**: 5-8
> **Focus**: Investigation, [[Social Encounters, [Light Combat]]
> **Location**: Parliament of Echoes, Aquabyssos
> **[[Key Theme**: Something is terribly wrong with democracy ### [The Impossible]] Vote * Read aloud:* > The grand chamber of the Parliament of Echoes resonates with an unnatural harmony. Where once heated debates echoed off the coral-carved walls, now only uimous agreement flows like a dark tide. [[The Speaker calls for a vote on the "[Emergency Powers]] Act" - a bill that would effectively dissolve democratic oversight. >
> "All in favor?" > Every hand rises in perfect synchronization. Not a single voice of dissent. Not even a moment's hesitation. The watching crowd gasps as even historically opposed parties vote as one.
> In the observation gallery, you notice a parliamentary aide's face go pale. She clutches a portfolio to her chest and rushes toward the exit, glancing fearfully over her shoulder. As she passes your group, she stumbles, dropping a single document that reads: "HELP - THEY'RE NOT THEMSELVES ANYMORE." ### [[Initial Reactions **Perception **DC 12****: Notice several parliament members have identical posture **Insight **DC 14****: Recognize the terror in the aide's eyes is genuine
**History **DC 13****: Remember these parties have never agreed on anything
**Arcana **DC 16****: Detect faint necrotic energy in the chamber ### [The Aide]]'s Plea **[[Marina Currentswift** ([Parliamentary Aide]]) - Young triton woman, visibly shaking
- Knows something is wrong but not what
- Afraid she's being watched
- Will only talk in private * If approached:* > "Please, not here. They have eyes everywhere now. Meet me at the [[Drowned Scholar tavern tonight. Back room. Come alone - or at least look like you are. I'll explain everything I can, but... But you have to promise to help. Democracy is dying and no one else seems to notice or care." ### Path A: [Parliamentary Records]] **Location**: [[Parliamentary Archive **Guardian**: [Archivist Kelp]]-Tome (shadow-touched) **Challenges**:

**Summary**: Path A: [[Parliamentary Records **Location**: [Parliamentary Archive]] **Guardian**: [[Archivist Kelp-Tome (shadow-touched) **Challenges**: - Key information at a glance.
