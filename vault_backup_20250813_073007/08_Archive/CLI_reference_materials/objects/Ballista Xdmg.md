# Ballista
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 96*  

A Ballista is a massive crossbow that fires heavy bolts. Loading a Ballista requires the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action, and aiming it requires another [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action. Then a crew member can take the Ballista Bolt action.
