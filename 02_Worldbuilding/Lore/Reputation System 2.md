# Reputation System
*Social Standing in the Merged Realms*

> *"In a world where surface and depth have collided, your reputation isn't just about what people think of you—it's about survival. The wrong word in the right place can seal borders, start wars, or save civilizations. Every action echoes through both realms, and memory runs deeper than the ocean trenches."*
> — [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Social Navigator Coral Diplomacy, Master of Cross-Realm Relations

## Overview

The Reputation System tracks characters' standing with various factions, organizations, settlements, and influential individuals across both [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor. Unlike simple approval ratings, this system recognizes that reputation is multifaceted—you might be feared by enemies, respected by allies, and unknown to neutral parties, all simultaneously.

Reputation affects everything from prices in shops to access to restricted areas, availability of services, quest opportunities, and survival during political crises. In the merged realms, reputation with one faction can dramatically affect standing with their allies or enemies, creating complex webs of social consequence.

The system operates on multiple scales: personal reputation with individuals, local reputation within communities, organizational reputation with factions, and realm-wide reputation affecting major political movements. Each scale influences the others but can be managed separately through targeted actions and relationship building.

Recent convergence events have complicated reputation management as factions from both realms now interact regularly, creating opportunities for diplomatic bridges or catastrophic misunderstandings. Characters may find their reputation in one realm helps or hinders them in the other, depending on political alliances and cultural differences.

## Core Mechanics

- **+41 to +60**: **Revered** - Greatly respected, significant influence
- **+21 to +40**: **Honored** - Well-regarded, doors open easily
- **+11 to +20**: **Friendly** - Liked and trusted, minor benefits
