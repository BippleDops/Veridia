## Player-Facing Summary

Races is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of races as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around races.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.

## Rule Summary

Races provides a systematic approach to handling specific game situations. This mechanic integrates with core D&D 5e rules while adding depth to gameplay.

## When to Use

Apply this rule when:
- Specific trigger conditions are met
- Players request this type of action
- The situation calls for additional detail

### Example 1: Basic Application
*Scenario*: Simple use case
*Resolution*: How to handle it
*Outcome*: What happens

### Example 2: Complex Situation
*Scenario*: More complicated use
*Resolution*: Step-by-step process
*Outcome*: Various possibilities

## Quick Reference

1. Trigger condition occurs
2. Determine modifiers
3. Make appropriate rolls
4. Apply results
5. Narrate outcome

## Plot Hooks

- A shipment has gone missing and truth emerges
- A noble needs help investigating before the festival
- A corpse reveals ancient history about a local noble

## Balance Analysis

### Damage Output Comparison
- Standard Fighter: `dice: 2d6`+5 (avg 12)
- This Ability: `dice: 2d8`+3 (avg 12)
- Conclusion: Comparable but trades consistency for variance

### Resource Economy
- Uses per day: 3
- Comparable feature: Action Surge (1/rest)
- Balance note: More uses but weaker effect
