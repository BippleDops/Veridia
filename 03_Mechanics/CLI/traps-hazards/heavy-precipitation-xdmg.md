# Heavy Precipitation
*Environmental Hazard*  

Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy snowfall is [Lightly Obscured](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/lightly-obscured-xphb.md), and creatures in the area have [Disadvantage](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on all Wisdom ([Perception](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Perception)) checks. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames.
