# Begging Fakery
## Overview
**Price**: -

**Weight**: -

## Description
Despite the protestations of thievesâ€™ guilds throughout Toril, I refuse to stock materials expressly meant for the cruel and unimaginative scam of begging fakery. Granted, those bent on schemes that take bread from the mouths of the truly needy will buy crutches, bandages, and so forth from our medical section, but I can little stop such reprobates.
