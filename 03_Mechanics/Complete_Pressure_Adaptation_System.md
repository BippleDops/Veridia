# Complete Pressure Adaptation System
*The Ultimate Guide to Evolution Under Pressure*

> **For the Table - Safety First:** This system includes body horror elements. Always check with players about comfort levels. Use the "Narrative Adaptation" option for players who want mechanical benefits without descriptive transformation.

## Core Concepts

### The Pressure Paradigm

Pressure in Aquabyssos is more than physical forceâ€”it's a transformative power that reshapes body, mind, and soul. Every 100 feet of depth adds approximately 3 atmospheres of pressure, but in this world, pressure also carries metaphysical weight that can alter the fundamental nature of existence.

### Adaptation Points (AP) System

**Adaptation Points** represent your body's capacity to change and evolve. They are earned through:

| Source | AP Gained | Frequency | Risk |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------|
| Natural Exposure | 1 AP | Per week at depth | Low |
| Forced Adaptation | 1d4 AP | Per day of extreme exposure | High |
| Symbiotic Integration | 2d4 AP | Per parasite accepted | Extreme |
| Technological Augmentation | 1d6 AP | Per modification | Moderate |
| Deep Mother's Blessing | 3d6 AP | Per vision embraced | Variable |
| Memory Absorption | 1 AP | Per depth memory consumed | Low |
| Ritual Transformation | 10 AP | One-time ceremony | Guaranteed |

### Adaptation Stages

Your total AP determines your overall adaptation stage:

| Stage | AP Required | Depth Limit | Changes |
|-------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Surface-Bound** | 0 | 30ft | Baseline human |
| **Shallow Adapted** | 10 | 500ft | Minor changes |
| **Depth Walker** | 25 | 1,500ft | Visible modifications |
| **Pressure Born** | 50 | 4,000ft | Major alterations |
| **Depth Speaker** | 75 | 10,000ft | Inhuman features |
| **Abyss Touched** | 100 | 20,000ft | Transcendent form |
| **Deep Merged** | 150 | Unlimited | One with the depths |

### Adaptation Resistance

Not everyone adapts equally. Your **Adaptation Resistance** determines how your body responds:

**Base Resistance** = 10 + Constitution modifier + Wisdom modifier

| Resistance | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 0-5 | Hyper-adaptive: Double AP gains, unstable mutations |
| 6-10 | Receptive: Normal AP gains, controlled changes |
| 11-15 | Resistant: Half AP gains, fewer mutations |
| 16-20 | Stubborn: Quarter AP gains, minimal change |
| 21+ | Immutable: No natural adaptation possible |

## Safety Tools & Player Agency

> **For the Table:** These options ensure all players can engage with the system comfortably.

### Narrative Adaptation Mode
Players uncomfortable with body horror can choose "Narrative Adaptation":
- Gain mechanical benefits without physical description
- Changes described as "auras," "spiritual evolution," or "pressure attunement"
- Same game effects, different narrative framing
- Player decides how much detail they're comfortable with

### The Veil System
**Green Light:** Full description okay
**Yellow Light:** Mechanical effects only, minimal description  
**Red Light:** Skip this content entirely, use alternate progression

### Recovery & Reversal Options

> **For the Table - Giving Players Control:**
> - **Stabilization Rituals:** Pause adaptation at any stage (500gp components, 8-hour ritual)
> - **Regression Therapy:** Reverse 1d4 AP per week with medical treatment (100gp/week)
> - **Divine Intervention:** Clerics can halt/reverse with Greater Restoration
> - **Technological Suppression:** Pressure suits prevent further adaptation
> - **The Surface Cure:** Extended surface time (1 month+) reverses most changes

### Consent Checkpoints
Before major transformations, always ask:
1. "Are you okay with this change?"
2. "How would you like it described?"
3. "Do you want to explore reversal options?"

### Alternative Progression Paths
For players opting out of transformation:
- **Pressure Mastery:** Mental techniques for depth resistance
- **Technological Reliance:** Enhanced equipment instead of body changes
- **Symbiotic Partnership:** External creature provides adaptation
- **Magical Warding:** Protective spells replace physical change

## Adaptation Paths

### The Three Primary Paths

#### 1. The Natural Path (Biological Evolution)
Embrace organic transformation through exposure and acceptance. Your body becomes one with the depths through gradual metamorphosis.

**Core Philosophy**: "The flesh is clay, pressure is the sculptor"
**Advantages**: No maintenance, natural immunities, instinctive abilities
**Disadvantages**: Irreversible, socially isolating, loss of humanity

#### 2. The Constructed Path (Technological Modification)
Use technology to overcome biological limitations. Pressure suits, implants, and mechanical augmentations preserve your humanity while granting depth access.

**Core Philosophy**: "Master the depths, don't become them"
**Advantages**: Reversible, upgradeable, socially acceptable
**Disadvantages**: Expensive, requires maintenance, can malfunction

#### 3. The Synthesis Path (Hybrid Adaptation)
Combine biological and technological approaches, using technology to guide and control biological changes.

**Core Philosophy**: "Evolution guided by intelligence"
**Advantages**: Best of both worlds, controlled transformation
**Disadvantages**: Complex management, expensive, requires expertise
