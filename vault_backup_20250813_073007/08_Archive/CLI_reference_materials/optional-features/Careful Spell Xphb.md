# Careful Spell
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 141. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span>*  

When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, spend 1 Sorcery Point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, and it takes no damage if it would normally take half damage on a successful save.

## Player-Facing Summary

Careful spell xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties careful spell xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at careful spell xphb to avert a public scandal.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
