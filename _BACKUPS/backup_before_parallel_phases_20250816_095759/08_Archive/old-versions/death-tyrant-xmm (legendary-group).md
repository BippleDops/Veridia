_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_ The region containing a death tyrant's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects: - **Negative Energy Suffusion.** Whenever a creature within 1 mile of the lair regains [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules) from a spell, it subtracts`d10`from the number of [hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] regained. - **Scopophobia.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair feel as if they're being watched. Any creature (excluding the death tyrant and its allies) that finishes a [[short-rest-xphb while within 1 mile of the lair must succeed on a **DC 15** Wisdom saving throw or gain no benefit from that rest. If the death tyrant dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. ## Player-Facing Summary Death tyrant xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of death tyrant xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around death tyrant xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is searching for a artifact for love
