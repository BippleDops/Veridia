--- > [!figure] View # The Drowned Embassy *Where air meets water, and diplomacy meets conspiracy* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

The Drowned Embassy stands partially submerged in the perpetual twilight waters of [[The Shadowmere|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Shadowmere, serving as [Aquabyssos]]'s official diplomatic presence in Aethermoor. Half above water, half below, the building exists in two worlds simultaneously - much like its inhabitants. ## Description

The Embassy appears as a once-grand marble structure that seems to have been pulled partially into the swamp. The upper floors maintain an illusion of normalcy with dry meeting rooms and offices, while the lower levels are completely flooded, accessible only to those who can breathe water. Strange bioluminescent coral grows along the waterline, pulsing with an rhythm that matches the tides of distant seas. ### The Tide Pools

Strange pools that show visions of [[Aquabyssos and can transport small objects between realms. Prolonged exposure causes scales to grow and lungs to adapt to water. ### The Drowning Chamber

A room that slowly floods and drains, used for "negotiations" and transforming willing subjects into Deep Heralds. ### The Coral Garden

A grotesque fusion of corrupted [Aether Crystals]] and deep-sea coral, growing into formations that whisper in long-dead languages. ## DM Secrets

> [!warning] The Rising Tide

> The Embassy is slowly expanding its flooded area by inches each month. At this rate, all of [[The Shadowmere|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Shadowmere]] will be underwater within five years, creating a beachhead for Aquabyssos invasion. > [!danger] The Deep Gate
> The portal in the basement isn't just a connection - it's an anchor point for a massive ritual. If three of the [[The Seven Shards|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]] are brought here, it could open a permanent gateway large enough for an army. > [!info] Hidden Prisoners
> Several missing nobles from [[Crystalhaven|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven are kept in the flooded cells, slowly being transformed into sleeper agents. They'll be returned with no memory of their time here, but carrying Aquabyssos commands in their subconscious. ## Player-Facing Summary The Drowned Embassy is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Drowned Embassy as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Drowned Embassy. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is blackmailing an heir for money
