_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 72_ ## Artisan's Tools

_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 220. Available in the Free Rules (2024)_ Artisan's Tools are each focused on crafting items and pursuing a trade. Each type of Artisan's Tools tools requires a separate proficiency. If you have proficiency with a tool, add your [[Proficiency Xphb]] to any ability check you make that uses the tool. If you have proficiency in a skill that's used with that check, you have [[Advantage Xphb]] on the check too. ## Explosive ## Food and Drink

_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 231. Available in the Free Rules (2024)_ ## Gaming Set

_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 221. Available in the Free Rules (2024)_ Proficiency with a gaming set applies to one type of game, such as Three-Dragon Ante or games of chance that use dice. ### Components A gaming set has all the pieces needed to play a specific game or type of game, such as a complete deck of cards or a board and tokens. ### History Your mastery of a game includes knowledge of its history, as well as of important events it was connected to or prominent historical figures involved with it. ### Insight Playing games with someone is a good way to gain understanding of their personality, granting you a better ability to discern their lies from their truths and read their mood. ### Sleight of Hand Sleight of Hand is a useful skill for cheating at a game, as it allows you to swap pieces, palm cards, or alter a die roll. Alternatively, engrossing a target in a game by manipulating the components with dexterous movements is a great distraction for a pickpocketing attempt. **Gaming Set** | Activity | DC |

_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 214. Available in the Free Rules (2024)_ **Range.** A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after the Ammunition or Thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second is the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have [[Advantage Xphb]] on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the long range. ## Ring

_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 139_ ## Rod ## Scroll ## Shield ## Spellcasting Focus ## Tack and Harness ## Tool ## Trade Bar

_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 213_ Because large numbers of coins can be difficult to transport and account for, many merchants prefer to use trade barsâ€”ingots of precious metals and alloys (usually silver). These bars are valued by weight. ## Trade Good Merchants commonly exchange trade goods without using currency. ## Treasure

_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 133_ ## Treasure (Art Object)

_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 215_ Idols cast of solid gold, necklaces studded with precious stones, paintings of ancient kings, bejeweled dishesâ€”art objects include all these and more. ## Treasure (Coinage) Characters often find coins on their adventures and can spend those coins in shops, inns, and other businesses. Coins come in different denominations based on the relative worth of their material. The Coin Values table lists coins and how much they're worth relative to the Gold Piece, which is the game's main coin. For example, 100 Copper Pieces are worth 1 Gold Piece. A coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound. ## Treasure (Gemstone)

_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 214_ Gemstones are small, lightweight, and easily secured compared to their same value in coins. ## Vehicle (Air) **Speed.** A ship sailing against a strong wind moves at half speed. In a dead calm (no wind), waterborne ships can't move under sail and must be rowed. Keelboats and Rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can't be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A Rowboat can be carried and weighs 100 pounds. **Crew.** A ship larger than a Keelboat or Rowboat needs a crew of skilled hirelings (see ""Services"") to function. The minimum number of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on the type of ship. **Passengers.** The number of Small and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate using hammocks. A ship outfitted with private accommodations can carry one-fifth as many passengers. A passenger usually pays 5 SP per day for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private cabin usually costs 2 GP per day. **Damage Threshold.** See the [[damage-threshold-xphb (variant-rules)]]. **Ship Repair.** Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 GP for materials and labor. If the repairs are made in a location where supplies and skilled labor are abundant, such as a city shipyard, the repair time and cost are halved. ## Vehicle (Land) ## Vehicle (Water) **Speed.** A ship sailing against a strong wind moves at half speed.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of item types as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around item types. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
