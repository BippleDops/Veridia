## Description
This tender-podded vegetable grows rampant in Maztica and is used in households rich and poor. Sweet and crisp when fresh, the long green beans can also be dried or pickled for nutritious winter fare and in this form brought back to Toril. I have imported both varieties and now am pleased to be the first to offer this wonder of the new world. (Dried beans 100 gp/lb.; pickled beans 10 gp/qt.)
