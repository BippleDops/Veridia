On a failed save,\ \ the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and\ \ also gains a random form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the\ \ Madness of Zuggtmoy table in appendix D) that lasts until the creature is\ \ cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't\ \ be reinfected, and it must be repeat the saving throw at the end of every\ \ 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's\ \ body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves,\ \ the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature\ \ that can be (see the \"Myconids\" entry in the Monster Manual)."
