# Baba Yaga's Pestle

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Quaterstaff, Melee Weapon

**Rarity:** artifact

**Attunement**: *requires attunement*

**Weight**: 4 lbs.

**Damage:** 1d6 bludgeoning versatile (1d8)

## Description

The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra `dice: 1d8` force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
