## Overview

The Memory Thief is one of Aquabyssos's most enigmatic and feared criminals, operating in the shadows to steal, modify, and trade in memories themselves. Unlike common thieves who target material possessions, this [[Mysterious Figure]] specializes in extracting specific memories from victims, leaving them with gaps in their recollections that they may not even realize exist.

The Memory Thief's true identity remains unknown, with victims describing different appearances, genders, and even species during encounters. This has led to theories that either multiple individuals share the title, or the thief possesses shapeshifting abilities that extend to manipulating observers' perceptions and memories of the encounters themselves.

What makes the Memory Thief particularly dangerous is their surgical precision - rather than causing wholesale amnesia, they extract specific memories with minimal collateral damage, making their crimes difficult to detect and even harder to prove.

## Appearance

Descriptions of the Memory Thief vary wildly and contradictorily. Witnesses have described:
- A tall, gaunt figure in hooded robes that seem to absorb light
- A charming, well-dressed individual of indeterminate gender with hypnotic eyes
- A child-like entity with ancient, knowing expressions
- A shapeless shadow that speaks directly to the mind
- An ordinary citizen who could be anyone encountered in daily life

The only consistent element across all accounts is that encounters with the Memory Thief feel dreamlike and surreal, with victims often uncertain whether the meeting actually occurred.

**Memory Sight.** The Memory Thief can see and read memories as visible auras around creatures within 60 feet. They can identify valuable or significant memories without making contact.

**Shapeshifter.** The Memory Thief can change their appearance at will, including species, gender, and apparent age. This change affects observers' memories of the encounter.

**Memory Immunity.** The Memory Thief is immune to all memory-altering effects and retains perfect recall of all experiences.

**Ethereal Jaunt.** The Memory Thief can shift to the Ethereal Plane as a bonus action and return as a move action.

### Actions

**Memory Extraction.** *Melee Spell Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* The target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the Memory Thief extracts one specific memory chosen by them. The target loses all recollection of the extracted memory and related experiences.

**Implanted Memory.** The Memory Thief can implant a false memory in a creature within 30 feet (DC 17 Wisdom save to resist). The implanted memory feels completely real to the target.

**Memory Maze (1/day).** The Memory Thief creates a 30-foot radius area where creatures experience confusion as their memories become jumbled. Creatures in the area must make DC 17 Wisdom saves each turn or be stunned as they become lost in false memories.

**Mind Touch.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +9 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 4d8 + 4 psychic damage, and the target must make a DC 17 Constitution save or have their maximum HP reduced by the damage taken.

### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)

**Move.** The Memory Thief moves up to their speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
**Memory Probe.** The Memory Thief attempts to read surface thoughts of a creature within 60 feet.
**Extract (Costs 2 Actions).** The Memory Thief uses Memory Extraction.

## Background

The Memory Thief first appeared in Aquabyssos approximately five years ago, initially dismissed as an urban legend until investigative [[Evidence]] confirmed the existence of systematic [[Memory Manipulation]] throughout the city. Early cases involved the theft of traumatic memories from victims of crime or accident, leading some to theorize that the entity began as a benevolent healer.

Over [[Time]], the Memory Thief's activities evolved to include extracting valuable information, embarrassing secrets, and skilled knowledge from various individuals. The pattern suggests either expanding abilities or changing motivations, though the entity's ultimate goals remain mysterious.

Investigations have revealed no clear origin for the Memory Thief, with some scholars theorizing they may be from another plane of existence or the result of experimental magic gone wrong.

## Current Activities

Recent Memory Thief incidents have focused on individuals connected to the city's political crisis, with several key figures reporting gaps in their recollections around crucial events. This has led to speculation that the Memory Thief is either working for one of the factions or pursuing their own agenda related to the current conflicts.

The entity has also been [[Link]]ed to a growing black market in stolen memories, where wealthy clients pay premium prices for experiences they could never have themselves or knowledge they could never legitimately acquire.

## Quest Hooks

1. **The Stolen Secret**: A key witness to a major crime has had their crucial memories stolen, and [[The Party]] must either recover the memories or find another way to uncover the truth.

2. **The Memory Market**: The party discovers an underground auction where stolen memories are being sold, providing an opportunity to confront the Memory Thief or their agents.

3. **Personal Stakes**: One of the [[Party Members]] begins experiencing memory gaps, indicating they've become a target of the Memory Thief for unknown reasons.

4. **[[The Collector]]'s Purpose**: Evidence suggests the Memory Thief is assembling memories related to a specific historical event or piece of knowledge that could affect the city's fate.

### [[Key Locations]]
1. Main entrance/approach
2. Central gathering area
3. Important buildings/features
4. Defensive positions (if applicable)
5. Hidden or secret areas

## [[DM Notes]]

The Memory Thief serves as both a recurring antagonist and a source of mystery in the campaign. Their ability to alter memories creates unique storytelling opportunities where players must question the reliability of their own knowledge and experiences. Use the Memory Thief to introduce plot twists, remove inconvenient knowledge from NPCs, or create situations where the party must decide whether recovering stolen memories is worth the risks involved.
