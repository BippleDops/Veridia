## Overview
The Carrion Court is an aristocratic hierarchy of undead beings that maintains the twisted traditions of an ancient noble court from beyond the grave. Led by **Lich-Queen Morwyn the Deathless**, this organization of vampires, liches, wraiths, and other powerful undead seeks to establish a kingdom where death is merely a transition to higher nobility rather than an ending. They operate with the pomp, ceremony, and political intrigue of a living court, but with the power and immortal patience of the undead.

### Conversion Process
1. **The Courtship**: Extended period of testing and preparation
2. **The Choice**: Formal offer of eternal service and nobility
3. **The Transformation**: Ritual conversion to appropriate undead type
4. **The Investiture**: Formal ceremony granting court title and position

### The Great Nobility Project
> [!warning] DM Only
> The court is systematically identifying and converting the most influential noble families across multiple kingdoms, planning to replace living aristocracy with undead rulers within 50 years.

### The Eternal Archive
> A vast library containing the memories and knowledge of every being the court has converted to undeath, making them one of the most knowledgeable organizations in the world.

### The Blood Pact Network
> Secret agreements with living nobles ensuring their conversion to undeath upon natural death, in exchange for current protection and favor.

### Social Intrigue
1. **The Invitation**: Party receives formal invitation to court function
2. **Noble Impostor**: Undead noble assumes identity of living aristocrat
3. **The Inheritance Dispute**: Legal battle between living and undead claimants
4. **Diplomatic Mission**: Negotiate between living kingdom and undead court

### Investigation & Mystery
5. **The Vanishing Nobles**: Track disappearing aristocratic families
6. **The Blood Trade**: Investigate suspicious funeral home activities
7. **Corrupted Clergy**: Root out undead infiltrators in religious orders
8. **The False Death**: Determine if noble's death was natural or orchestrated

### Combat & Military
9. **Siege of the Bone Palace**: Direct assault on court headquarters
10. **The Undead Army**: Face military force led by death knights
11. **Vampire Hunt**: Track and eliminate specific court noble
12. **Necromantic Duel**: Magical combat with court's lich advisors

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
