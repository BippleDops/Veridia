# Isolde's Answer (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *divination*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a crystal ball or gilt-framed mirror worth at least 250 gp)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
You hold a mirror or crystal ball and ask a question (which must have a *who, what,* or *where*). For instance, “where did I put my keys?” or “what is on the other side of the Iron Gate?” or “who is the fairest of them all?” The item them shows you an answering image, provided the object, place, or person is within 5 miles of you. It provides no other information about the image.
