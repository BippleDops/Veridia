## Special Traits
**Animated Hair:** A korred carries cuttings of its own hair, braided into ropes, in its leather pouch. It can quickly splice these short hair ropes into a longer rope and magically animate it to entangle foes. The time it takes to weave together enough rope for the job depends on the size of the creature to be entangled, as shown below. A korred's animated hair rope has AC 14, 8 hp, is immune to all but slashing damage, and flies with a speed of 30 feet. When it attacks its target, the target creature must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity or Strength saving throw or be restrained. A restrained creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. The hair rope is destroyed by a successful Str saving throw, but a successful Dex save leaves it unaffected and it continues attacking.

| **Target Size** | **Time to Create** | **Duration** |
|---|---|---|
| Up to Tiny | 1 round | 9 rounds |
| Small or Medium | 2 rounds | 6 rounds |
| Large | 3 rounds | 3 rounds |

**Mobility:** An opponent has tactical disadvantage on opportunity attack rolls against a korred.

**Spell-like Abilities:** Korreds can use the following spell-like abilities, using Charisma as their casting ability (DC 12). A korred doesn’t need material components to use these abilities.

- At Will: *animate objects (stones only), shatter, speak with stone (functions identically to speak with plants, but with stones instead), stone shape*

**Stone Stride:** A korred can step into a stone and emerge from any other stone within 30 feet as part of normal movement. The stones must be at least as large as the korred. It can't end its turn inside a stone.

## Actions
**Club:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d6+2`) bludgeoning damage.

**Shears:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d8+2`) slashing damage. A korred scores a critical hit with shears if its attack roll is a natural 18, 19, or 20.

**Stone:** *Ranged Attack:* +4 to hit, range 20 ft./60 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (`dice: 1d4+2`) bludgeoning damage.

**Laugh (Recharge 5—6):** Area Attack: automatic hit, range 60 ft., all creatures in range. Hit: creatures in range that can hear the laugh must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned for `dice: 1d3` rounds.
