# Elder Matthias Stoneward

*"The crystal gardens may shine with ethereal beauty, but it's stone and steel that keep this floating realm from tumbling into the void. Pretty magic fades - good engineering endures."*

## Overview

Elder Matthias Stoneward is Aethermoor's chief structural engineer, responsible for maintaining the complex systems that keep the floating island stable in the sky. A mountain dwarf who adapted his traditional stone-working skills to the unique challenges of aerial construction, he oversees everything from the massive crystal anchors that provide lift to the intricate networks of pipes and supports that distribute weight throughout the island.

Stoneward has served Aethermoor for over thirty-five years, earning his "Elder" title through both experience and the grudging respect of his peers who initially doubted a dwarf's ability to work in an aerial environment. His engineering expertise has become essential as the island's crystal corruption spreads, requiring constant structural adaptations to maintain stability.

As the Silverscale Conspiracy's influence grows, Stoneward finds himself caught between his duty to maintain the island's infrastructure and growing suspicions about who is really controlling Aethermoor's destiny.

## Appearance

Matthias is a broad-shouldered dwarf in his mid-seventies, with steel-gray hair and beard both braided with small crystal fragments that pulse with gentle light. His hands show the wear of decades working with both traditional tools and crystal-based technology, bearing scars from crystal cuts and metal burns alike.

He wears practical leather work clothes reinforced with crystal-woven fabric that helps him withstand the magical energies he works with daily. His tool belt contains both traditional dwarven engineering instruments and specialized crystal-working devices unique to Aethermoor. Most prominently, he carries an ancient family warhammer that has been modified with crystal focusing elements.

## Personality
- Deeply practical and focused on structural integrity above political concerns
- Skeptical of purely magical solutions, preferring hybrid crystal-mechanical systems
- Protective of his workers and adamant about safety protocols
- Growing increasingly suspicious of the changes being made to the island without proper engineering consultation

## Statistics
**Medium humanoid (mountain dwarf), lawful good**
- **AC** 17 (Splint Armor)
- **HP** 102 (15d8 + 30)
- **Speed** 25 ft, fly 30 ft (crystal harness)
- **STR** 18 (+4) **DEX** 12 (+1) **CON** 16 (+3) **INT** 19 (+4) **WIS** 15 (+2) **CHA** 13 (+1)
- **Skills** Athletics +7, Investigation +7, Perception +5, Arcana +7
- **Damage Resistances** Poison, Force (crystal adaptation)
- **Senses** Darkvision 120 ft, passive Perception 15
- **Languages** Common, Dwarvish, Primordial (Terran, Auran), Celestial
- **Challenge** 7 (2,900 XP)

### Special Abilities
**Dwarven Resilience.** Matthias has advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance to poison damage.

**Crystal Sensitivity.** Matthias can detect the stability and corruption level of crystal formations within 60 feet, and has advantage on saves against crystal-based magical effects.

**Structural Engineer.** Matthias can spend 1 minute analyzing any structure to determine its weak points, methods of construction, and optimal repair techniques.

### Actions
**Multiattack.** Matthias makes two attacks with his crystal-enhanced hammer.

**Crystal-Forged Warhammer +1.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d8) force damage from embedded crystals.

**Emergency Protocols (1/day).** Matthias can activate emergency systems in a 60-foot radius, creating walls of force, adjusting local gravity, or providing temporary structural support to damaged areas.

**Crystal Resonance (3/day).** Matthias strikes his hammer against a crystal surface, creating a harmonic frequency that can either stabilize corrupted crystals (healing 2d8 HP to crystal-based creatures) or disrupt hostile crystal magic (dispel magic effect).

### Legendary Actions (3 per turn, when in engineering areas)
**Move.** Matthias moves up to his speed.
**Tool Work.** Matthias uses a tool, activates a system, or makes a quick repair.
**Hammer Strike (Costs 2 Actions).** Matthias makes one warhammer attack.

## Background

Matthias arrived in Aethermoor thirty-five years ago as part of a diplomatic exchange between the mountain dwarf kingdoms and the floating realm. Initially viewed with suspicion by those who doubted a dwarf could adapt to aerial engineering, he quickly proved himself by solving critical stability issues that had plagued the island for decades.

His innovative fusion of traditional dwarven engineering with Aethermoor's crystal technology revolutionized the island's infrastructure. He developed new techniques for working with living crystals, created hybrid support systems that combined stone with crystalline matrices, and established safety protocols that have prevented numerous catastrophic failures.

Throughout his career, he has maintained detailed records of every modification made to the island's structure, creating an invaluable archive of engineering knowledge that only he fully understands.

## Current Activities

Matthias is increasingly alarmed by unauthorized modifications being made to critical systems throughout Aethermoor. He's discovered that someone has been secretly altering crystal matrices and structural supports, changes that seem designed to make the island more susceptible to external control rather than improving stability.

He's been conducting discrete investigations while maintaining his regular duties, trying to determine who is behind these modifications and what their ultimate goal might be. His findings suggest a coordinated effort to compromise the island's independence.

## Relationships
- **Engineering Guild**: Respected leader despite initial prejudice against his non-native origins
- **Crystal Garden Keepers**: Professional relationship managing crystal growth and stability
- **Royal Engineers**: Growing tension over unauthorized modifications to his designs
- **Worker Teams**: Loyal followers who trust his expertise and safety protocols
- **Diplomatic Corps**: Occasional consultant on inter-realm engineering projects

## Secrets
- Has evidence that someone is systematically weakening the island's defenses
- Maintains secret blueprints showing the island's complete structural layout, including hidden areas
- Discovered that some recent crystal corruptions are artificially induced rather than natural
- Built hidden emergency systems that could disconnect Aethermoor from external magical influences

## Quest Hooks
1. Matthias approaches the party after discovering sabotage to critical systems, needing discrete investigators who aren't part of the official power structure.
2. The party needs access to restricted areas of Aethermoor, and Matthias can provide passage through maintenance tunnels in exchange for help with his investigation.
3. A critical system failure threatens the island's stability, requiring the party to assist Matthias with dangerous repairs while avoiding those who might want the island to fall.

## DM Notes
Matthias serves as a valuable source of information about Aethermoor's hidden areas and structural vulnerabilities. His engineering expertise can provide creative solutions to challenges or create dramatic scenarios involving the island's stability. Use his outsider perspective and growing suspicions to highlight the Silverscale Conspiracy's influence while providing a trustworthy ally for characters seeking to uncover the truth.
