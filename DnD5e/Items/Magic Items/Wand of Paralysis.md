## Description
This [[Wand|wand]] has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cause a thin blue ray to streak from the tip toward a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15 [[Constitution|Constitution]] saving throw or be [[Paralyzed|paralyzed]] for 1 minute. At the end of each of the target’s turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The [[Wand|wand]] regains `dice: 1d6+1` (1d6+1) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
