## Special Traits
**Flawless Tracking:** An aerial servant can track any creature on the same plane of existence as itself across any terrain automatically.

**Link with Caster:** When summoned, an aerial servant creates a mental link between itself and the caster who summoned it. Should the aerial servant fail the mission it was assigned, it returns to the caster and attacks him. The aerial servant can find the caster as long as they are on the same plane of existence. If the caster leaves the plane, the link is temporarily broken. If the two are again on the same plane of existence, the link is immediately re-established and the aerial servant moves at full speed toward the caster's location. The link is broken permanently only when the aerial servant or the caster is destroyed.

**Natural Invisibility:** An aerial servant is permanently invisible, and it remains invisible even when attacking. This ability is inherent and can't be magically cancelled or dispelled. Invisibility is not factored into the aerial servant's +8 Stealth modifier; it gains the benefits of invisibility in addition. An aerial servant is visible on the Astral and Ethereal Planes, but it is always lightly obscured in those locales.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The aerial servant slams once and constricts once, or uses its wind blast.

**Melee Attack—Slam:** +9 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d10 + 5` bludgeoning damage, and the target creature is grappled.

**Melee Attack—Constrict:** automatic hit (one creature grappled by the aerial servant). Hit: `dice: 2d10 + 5` bludgeoning damage.

**Area Attack—Wind Blast (recharge 5, 6):** automatic hit (80 ft. line; creatures in the line). Hit: `dice: 4d10` bludgeoning damage, and creatures of Medium size or smaller are knocked prone and pushed `dice: 2d10` feet away from the aerial servant. Affected creatures that make a successful DC 17 Dex saving throw take half damage and are not knocked prone, but they are pushed away.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any (Plane of Air)

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
Aerial servants are semi-intelligent creatures from the Plane of Air that often roam the Astral and Ethereal planes. One is seldom met on the Material Plane unless it was summoned by a spellcaster and commanded to perform some task. Typically, such tasks involve retrieving objects or tracking the summoner’s enemies. Though an aerial servant performs whatever task is asked of it, it resents being summoned and forced to do another’s bidding; therefore, it looks for ways to pervert the conditions of the summoning and its mission. An aerial servant that fails or is thwarted in its mission becomes insane and immediately returns to the caster who summoned it, either killing the caster or carrying the caster back to the Plane of Air with it.

Aerial servants are always invisible on the Plane of Air. On other planes, they can be seen when they wish, though only vaguely, appearing as humanoids composed of whitish-gray vapor. Sometimes eyes, a nose, and a small mouth form in the vapor. They can’t become invisible on the Astral and Ethereal Planes, but their appearance is always indistinct there.

Aerial servants attack with a shearing blast of wind or by grabbing and crushing an opponent in their powerful grasp.

Aerial servants can be killed only on their native Plane of Air. If slain elsewhere, they simply dissolve into wisps of vapor and return to their home plane.
