## Overview
The last surviving member of the Selenthian Dynasty, Marina has died by drowning 777 times, each death making her more powerful and less human.

3. Offers valuable information in exchange for childhood memories
4. Someone is stealing from her memory vaults

## Quotes
- "Everything that was, is for sale. Everything that is, is negotiable."
- "I've died so many times, death now owes me favors."
- "Your memories are quaint. How much for your mother's last smile?"
- "The economy of drowning favors those who sink with style."

## Court Etiquette
Visitors must observe:
- Never acknowledge the drowning
- Address her by pre-drowning titles
- Bring memories as tribute
- Dance at least once (while drowning)
- Never mention the number 1000

## DM Notes
Marina represents the desperate clinging to humanity while embracing monstrous transformation. She's a tragic figure who uses commerce and etiquette to maintain sanity. Her memory manipulation makes her incredibly dangerous for information-based campaigns. She should feel like a decadent noble playing elaborate games while drowning eternally. Her connection to surface operations makes her a perfect bridge between Aquabyssos and Aethermoor plots. The countdown to her 1000th drowning creates timeline pressure.
