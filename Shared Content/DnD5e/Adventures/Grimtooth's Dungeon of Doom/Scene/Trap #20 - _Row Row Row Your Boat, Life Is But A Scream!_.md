# Trap #20 - "Row Row Row Your Boat, Life Is But A Scream!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The current will carry anyone who has found lhe elfish boats toward a point in the center of the far wall of the grotto. At this point there is a curtain of old chains hanging down from a fixture in the ceiling. The chains are set closely enough together that the delvers cannot see what lies beyond. The chains also come within inches of the water's surface so they cannot be looked under. They are heavy enough that they hang straight down, but loose enough that the prow of a canoe, or boat will force them apart. Unless otherwise noted chain curtains like this separate every part of this river system in the Tomb from every other part.
> 
> Once the delvers have parted the curtain they will find themselves on a swifter, much narrower and shallower portion of the river. At this point there will be no real necessity for the party to paddle unless they are really into speed. The can use paddles to steer if they like, but there doesn't appear to be any part of the waterway different than any other part.
> 
> The trap here lies just below the surface, and is a wonder of dwarven technology in it's simplest form. Set in the river bottom pointing back into the current are three lines of razor sharp spears. They are set inches below the surface and are thin enough that they do not ruffle the water's surface. They are elevated in response to any lateral pressure on the curtain at [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]]. Push aside the curtain and you will release a counterweight that lifts the spears off the bottom and upward at just the right attitude to spoil the delvers day! The spears are made of a corrosion proof alloy perfected by the dwarves. They are as sharp today as they were the day they were set in place. This is one of those intrinsic treasures that the party is likely to overlook in the ensuing carnage. Metal of this type that holds its edge against any test, and resists corrosion under water for centuries would be worth over 1,000 g.p. per blade to any weaponsmith. They would alô€ƒ“o serve any delver who survives well as a weapon.
> 
> Just the thing to build overconfidence.
> 
> The object of the spears is not, as some would think to impale tomb robbers through the bottom of their flimsy boats. Oh no! Evinrood has been far more subtle than that. The spears are in place to slice open any watercraft that finds it's way down this merrie waterway. (Oh I suppose if the party chose to swim down the river, battling the underwater denizens every turn of the way, that these spears would hit them about chest high. But no one would be fool enough to try to swim the length of the river... well we are talking dungeon delvers after all.)
> 
> Keep in mind the current is very swift here. Ruination is almost a certainty. After the first boat has been impaled there will be little that its crew can do to avoid being carried along in their rapidly-sinking craft. Any boat behind it may take a lesson from what happens to the first, but being delvers the occupants of the first boat will more than likely be inarticulate in their confused babble. If some kind of halt can be accomplished the spears can be pulled out Qf the sockets they are set in with little effort. The spears are `dice: 4D6+3` dwarvish steel Pila. Any party that cannot stop but manages to avoid the spears will be swept on into another curtain at the end of the short tunnel, and into the next trap.
> 
> The risk factor against life for those in the boats is low; clearly this is to rob the delvers of their transportation. Against boat people a one skull rating. For the swimmers the rating goes up to three, a nasty surprise for the combat-weary.
