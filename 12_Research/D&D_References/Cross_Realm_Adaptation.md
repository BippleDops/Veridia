# Cross-Realm Adaptation
## Dual Environment Evolution

### Overview
Characters who frequently travel between Aquabyssos and Aethermoor develop hybrid physiology allowing survival in both environments.

### Adaptation Process

#### Month 1-3: Initial Flexibility
- No penalties when switching between realms
- +1 Constitution saves vs. pressure/altitude
- Rapid environmental adjustment (1 hour vs. 24 hours)

#### Month 4-12: Biological Compromise
- Develop dual respiratory system
- Pressure/altitude tolerance ranges overlap
- Enhanced environmental awareness
- -1 to Constitution (biological stress)

#### Year 2-3: Hybrid Stability
- Function normally in both environments
- Can assist others with adaptation
- Enhanced constitution (+1 back, net 0)
- Unique magical signature (both realms)

#### Year 3+: Convergence Master
- Immune to environmental extremes
- Can create transition zones for others
- Natural ambassador between realms
- Permanent dual-realm citizenship

### Benefits
- Diplomatic immunity in both realms
- Economic advantages in cross-realm trade
- Natural mediator for inter-realm conflicts
- Access to combined magical traditions

### Drawbacks
- Never fully "at home" in either realm
- Identity questions about cultural belonging
- Potential target for purist factions
- Medical complications from hybrid physiology

### Social Implications
- Viewed with suspicion by extremists
- Valued by diplomatic and trade organizations
- Natural leaders in convergence communities
- Often caught between conflicting loyalties
