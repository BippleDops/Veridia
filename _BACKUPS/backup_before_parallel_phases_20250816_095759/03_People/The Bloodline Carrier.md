## Special Abilities

**Ancestral Resoce.** Lysander can commune with the spirits of his bloodline ancestors. As an action, he can gain advantage on any ability check, attack roll, or saving throw for 1 minute (3/day).

**Crystal Wings.** Lysander can manifest ethereal crystal wings that grant him a flying speed. While flying, he sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

**Divine Bloodline.** When Lysander casts a spell of 1st level or higher, he regains hit points equal to the spell's level. Additionally, undead and fiends have disadvantage on attacks against him.

**Lineage Magic.** Lysander can cast spells using spell slots from both his sorcerer and paladin classes. He knows additional spells passed down through his bloodline that don't count against his known spells limit.

**Aura of Ancestral Protection.** Friendly creatures within 10 feet of Lysander have resistance to necrotic damage and advantage on death saving throws.

**Spellcasting.** Lysander is a 14th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save **DC 19**, +11 to hit). He has the following spells prepared:

**Sorcerer Spells (Divine Soul):**
- Cantrips (at will): *light*, *sacred flame*, *guidance*, *prestidigitation*, *thaumaturgy*, *mending*
- 1st level (4 slots): *cure wounds*, *detect magic*, *bless*, *shield*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *aid*, *spiritual weapon*, *misty step*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell*, *daylight*, *revivify*
- 4th level (3 slots): *greater invisibility*, *freedom of movement*
- 5th level (2 slots): *greater restoration*, *dispel evil and good*
- 6th level (1 slot): *heal*, *mass suggestion*
- 7th level (1 slot): *fire storm*, *plane shift*

- 2nd level (3 slots): *lesser restoration*, *zone of truth*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *remove curse*, *protection from energy*
- 4th level (1 slot): *banishment*, *locate creature*

## Actions

**Multiattack.** Lysander makes two Ancestral Blade attacks or casts a spell and makes one attack.

**Ancestral Blade.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`dice: `dice: 1d8`` + 4) slashing damage plus 9 (`dice: `dice: 2d8``) radiant damage. If the target is an undead or fiend, it takes an additional 7 (`dice: `dice: 2d6``) radiant damage.

**Divine Smite (4/Day).** When Lysander hits with his Ancestral Blade, he can expend a spell slot to deal an additional 9 (`dice: `dice: 2d8``) radiant damage, +4 (`dice: `dice: 1d8``) radiant damage per spell level above 1st.

**Channel Bloodline (1/Day).** Lysander calls upon his entire ancestral line for power. For 1 minute, he gains the following benefits:
- +2 to all saving throws
- Resistance to all damage types except psychic
- Can cast any spell he knows without expending a spell slot (once per spell)
- His melee attacks deal maximum damage

**Ancestral Judgment (1/Day).** Lysander targets one creature within 60 feet. The target must make a **DC 19** Wisdom saving throw. On failure, they take 45 (`dice: `dice: 10d8``) radiant damage and are stunned for 1 round as they experience the judgment of Lysander's ancestors. On success, half damage and no stun.

## Description

Lysander Crystalborn stands as living testament to the power of pure bloodlines in Aethermoor. Tall and imposing at 6'3", his human heritage has been refined over generations of selective breeding with celestial-touched beings and exposure to the purest crystal magic. His golden hair seems to contain flecks of actual crystal that catch and refract light, and his blue eyes glow with inherited divine power.

Most remarkably, intricate crystalline patterns run beneath his skin like luminous veins, pulsing with the combined magical essence of his entire bloodline. These patterns become more pronounced when he channels ancestral power, sometimes forming runic script that tells the stories of his forebears.

Lysander wears ceremonial plate armor forged from blessed metals and inscribed with the names and deeds of every notable ancestor in his line. The armor itself has been passed down for twelve generations, growing stronger with each bearer's accomplishments.

He maintains the Bloodline Sanctum, a crystal cathedral where the spirits of his ancestors dwell in crystalline statues that can speak and offer guidance. This sacred space serves both as a family shrine and a meeting place for others who carry significant magical bloodlines.

## Relationships

**Allies:**
- **[[Order of the Shattered Crown** - His primary faction dedicated to restoring royal bloodlines
- **[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]** - Distant cousin through ancient royal connections
- **The Genealogy Guild** - Scholars who research and verify bloodline claims
- **Crystal-Touched Nobility** - Other families with similar magical heritage

**Enemies:**
- **[[The Convergence Seekers** - They view bloodline purity as an obstacle to unity
- **Bloodline Thieves** - Criminals who steal or corrupt magical heritage
- **The Common Revolutionary** - Radicals who oppose hereditary privilege
- **Shadow Corruptors** - Entities that seek to taint pure bloodlines

**Complicated:**
- **[Keeper of the Shattered Crown, Marcus Crystalvein]]** - Rival claimant to certain royal bloodlines
- **[[Professor Aldric Crystalweaver]]** - Collaborates on magical research but disagrees on bloodline ethics
- **The Bastard Branch** - Illegitimate relatives who challenge his inheritance claims

## Quest Hooks

1. **The Bloodline War** - Several ancient families are making competing claims to the same royal inheritance, and their magical bloodlines are literally fighting each other through their descendants. Lysander needs mediators before the conflict tears apart Aethermoor's nobility.

2. **The Corrupted Heritage** - A plague is spreading that specifically targets those with magical bloodlines, corrupting their inherited abilities. Lysander must work with the party to find a cure before all of Aethermoor's ancient families are destroyed.

3. **The Lost Heir** - Lysander has discovered evidence of a surviving member of a bloodline thought extinct for centuries. Finding and protecting this person could restore a powerful magical dynastyâ€”or unleash something that was deliberately hidden.

4. **The Ancestral Awakening** - The spirits of Lysander's ancestors are becoming increasingly active and demanding, sometimes possessing him to complete unfinished business from their lifetimes. He needs help managing these supernatural family obligations.

5. **The Bloodline Synthesis** - An enemy has discovered how to artificially combine multiple bloodlines into a single person, creating supernaturally powerful but unstable individuals. Lysander must stop this perversion of natural heritage.

## Motivations

**Primary**: Preserve and protect the purity of magical bloodlines for future generations
**Secondary**: Restore the rightful royal bloodlines to their proper positions of power
**Hidden**: Discover the true purpose behind his bloodline's celestial blessing

## Secrets
- Hidden information about this character
- Unknown connections or past events

## Roleplaying Notes

**Personality**: Noble and dignified with genuine compassion, but can be unconsciously condescending to those without magical heritage. Takes family honor very seriously.

**Ideals**: "Power without responsibility is tyranny, but responsibility without power is impotence. Those blessed with strong bloodlines must use that blessing to protect all people."

**Bonds**: "Every ancestor who came before me lives on through my actions. I am not just myselfâ€”I am the culmination of a thousand generations of nobility."

**Flaws**: "I sometimes judge people by their bloodline rather than their character. My pride in my heritage can blind me to the value of those born to humbler origins."

**Voice**: Speaks with perfect diction and formal grammar, as if addressing a royal court. His voice carries harmonic undertones that suggest multiple speakers.

**Speaking Patterns**:
- "The wisdom of my forebears suggests..."
- "In the name of my bloodline and its honored dead..."
- "Noble birth is a gift that must be earned anew each generation..."
- "The crystal remembers what the mind forgets..."

**Mannerisms**: Unconsciously traces genealogical patterns in the air when thinking deeply. The crystal patterns under his skin glow brighter when he's emotional. He has a habit of consulting with empty air, as if speaking to invisible advisorsâ€”which he actually is.
