# Linguist
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 167*  

You have studied languages and codes, gaining the following benefits:

- Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.  
- You learn three languages of your choice.  
- You can ably create written ciphers. Others can't decipher a code you create unless you teach them, they succeed on an Intelligence check (DC equal to your Intelligence score + your proficiency bonus), or they use magic to decipher it.

## Player-Facing Summary

Linguist is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of linguist as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around linguist.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties linguist to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at linguist to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to linguist active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
