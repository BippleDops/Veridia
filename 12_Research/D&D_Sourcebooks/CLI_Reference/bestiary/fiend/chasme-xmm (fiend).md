## Chasme

*Demon of Betrayal and Sycophancy*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Abyss)  
- **Treasure.** Relics  

Flying forth from the Abyss, chasmes resemble horse-size flies. They incapacitate foes by producing a mind-numbing droning, then use their proboscises to drain victims of life. In the Abyss, most chasmes obsequiously serve more powerful demons and search for captives to press into demonic hordes.
