# The Floating Markets of Nereidios
*Where Ocean and Commerce Flow as One*

## Overview
The Floating Markets of Nereidios are a massive collection of interconnected ships, platforms, and artificial islands that form a mobile trading city on [[The Azure Coast]]. This unique maritime marketplace serves as the primary hub for aquatic goods, deep-sea treasures, and cultural exchange between surface dwellers and underwater civilizations.

## Market Operations
The floating city operates on tidal schedules, with different merchant districts rotating based on ocean currents and seasonal patterns.
