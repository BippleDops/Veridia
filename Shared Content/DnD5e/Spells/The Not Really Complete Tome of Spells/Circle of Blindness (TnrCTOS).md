# Circle of Blindness (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *8th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 300 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 hour


## Effects
You create an immobile circle with a 30-foor-radius to delay and confuse enemies. Within the area of effect, all creatures be-come blinded and deafened and lose tremorsense. It also suppresses divination spells that enhance or produce additional senses, such as *arcane eye, clairvoyance, detect magic, see invisibility*, and so on. It does not affect either truesight or the spell *true seeing*, however. An affected creature that leaves the area regains its sight and hearing.

***At Higher Levels.*** If cast with a 9th-level spell slot, the circleâ€™s radius increases to 50 feet.
