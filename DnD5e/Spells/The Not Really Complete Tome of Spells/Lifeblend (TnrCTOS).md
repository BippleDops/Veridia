# Lifeblend (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *8th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a cage made of precious metals, worth at least 2,500 gp, and a lit candelabra studded with as many candles as there creatures to blend and studded with 1,000 gp worth of rubies, which are all consumed by the casting)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You place two living beasts, humanoids, giants, monstrosities, or plants (which must have an Intelligence of at least 1) in the cage and touch each of them while casting the spell. When you finish casting the spell, each creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If either of these rolls are successful, the spell fails.

If both creatures fail their saving throws, then over the course of the next 24 hours, the creatures begin to mutate and join together, taking on characteristics of both “parent” creatures. The GM should roll a d20.

| **Roll** | **Result** |
|---|---|
| 1-5 | ***Success.*** The resulting creature looks more or less like a combination of its two original forms. |
| 6 | ***Bonding.*** The creatures are not truly |
| 6 | melded together but instead are conjoined melded together but instead are conjoined in some way. |
| 7 | ***Imperfect Melding.*** The two creatures have joined together in a “tauric” fashion—half one creature and half the other. |
| 8 | ***Shapeshifter.*** The creature is melded but can shift between its two parent forms and may have a split personality—it does not have a “hybrid” form. The change may be voluntary or involuntary. |
| 9 | ***Dominance.*** The creature looks mostly like one of its original forms with only hints of the original creature. |
| 10 | **Death.**While it looks like the desired creature, something went horribly wrong with the transformation and it takes 15d10+20 necrotic damage. If it is still alive, it may be able to be nursed back to health. |

The resultant creature’s attributes, abilities, and attacks should be determined by the GM, using the original creatures’ attributes as a guideline.
