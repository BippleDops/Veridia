## Special Traits
**Locking Jaws:** When the aurumvorax bites a creature and locks its jaws, the aurumvorax enters that creature's space. The aurumvorax can't move on its own while its jaws are locked, but it moves with the other creature. To get free from the aurumvorax, the target creature or an adjacent ally must use its action to make a successful DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check. The aurumvorax can't use its bite attack again until it releases its jaws, which automatically moves it out of that creature's space.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The aurumvorax bites once and attacks twice with its claws. If the aurumvorax has its jaws locked onto a target, it rakes that target instead of biting.

**Melee Attack—Bite:** +8 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d8 + 5` piercing damage, and the aurumvorax locks its jaws onto the target (see below).

**Melee Attack—Claws:** +8 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d6 + 5` slashing damage.

**Melee Attack—Rake:** automatic hit (reach 0 ft.; one creature the aurumvorax’s jaws were locked onto at the start of the aurumvorax’s turn). Hit: `dice: 4d6 + 5` slashing damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate plains, hills, or forests

**Organization**: Solitary or pair

## Description
The aurumvorax (also called the golden gorger) is an extremely vicious creature. It will attack any living prey it meets in its territory, and its territory often extends up to a mile in all directions from its lair.

Despite being just 3 feet long, an aurumvorax weighs between 100 and 150 pounds. The creature’s copper-colored claws are razor sharp. Its eyes are silver with gold pupils, and its whiskers are bronze in color.

The aurumvorax attacks by biting a foe, locking its jaws, then leaping onto the creature and shredding it with a tornado of claws. Once its jaws are locked onto an enemy, an aurumvorax doesn’t let go until either it or its prey is dead.
