## Overview
Senator Cordelia Valerius is one of Aquabyssos' most beloved and respected parliamentary leaders, known for her passionate advocacy for citizen rights, progressive social policies, and unwavering moral stance against corruption. What neither she nor her constituents realize is that she has been partially shadow-replaced over the past two years, with key aspects of her personality and decision-making subtly altered to serve shadow interests. She genuinely believes she's fighting for justice while unknowingly advancing the shadow agenda through seemingly beneficial legislation.

### Early Life
**Origins**: Born to a middle-class merchant family in Aquabyssos Prime's Tidal District
**Education**: Scholarship student at the prestigious Deep Academy of Political Sciences
**Early Career**: Started as a legal advocate for displaced families during the Depth Wars
**Motivation**: Witnessed government corruption that left communities without aid
**Natural Talent**: Exceptional orator with genuine empathy for constituents

### The Gradual Replacement

**Initial Contact** (3 years ago)

- She attributed new "insights" to political experience and wisdom
- No dramatic personality changesâ€”just gradual shifts in priorities

**The Partial Replacement** (2 years ago)
