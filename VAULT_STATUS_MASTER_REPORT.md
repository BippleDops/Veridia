## Priority Development Areas

### 🔴 Critical (Immediate Need)

2. **NPC Development**: Major characters need full entries
3. **Location Details**: Key locations are stubs

### 🟡 Important (Soon)
1. **Visual Assets**: Character art, location images
2. **Audio Resources**: Ambiance, music playlists
3. **Handout Creation**: Player materials
4. **World Bible**: Consolidated lore reference

### 🟢 Nice to Have (Future)
1. **Advanced generators**: NPC dialogue, encounters
2. **Interactive tools**: Character sheets, calculators
3. **Animation resources**: Combat maps, effects
4. **Video content**: Intro videos, tutorials

## Technical Health

### File Organization
- ✅ Consistent folder structure
- ✅ Proper YAML frontmatter
- ✅ Standardized naming conventions
- ⚠️ Some duplicate files need cleanup
- ⚠️ Stub files need development

### Cross-References
- **Strong Areas**: Mechanics heavily cross-linked
- **Weak Areas**: Stub files have broken links
- **Improvement**: Need systematic link verification

### Performance Considerations
- Large vault size may impact load times
- Consider archiving completed sessions
- Optimize image assets when added
- Regular maintenance recommended

## Maintenance Schedule

### Daily (During Active Campaign)
- Update session logs
- Track faction changes
- Monitor reality stability
- Update NPC status

### Weekly
