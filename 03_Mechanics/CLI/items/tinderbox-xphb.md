# Tinderbox
*Adventuring gear*  


- **Cost**: 5 sp
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

A Tinderbox is a small container holding flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a [Candle](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/candle-xphb.md), [Lamp](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/lamp-xphb.md), [Lantern](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/hooded-lantern-xphb.md), or [Torch](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/torch-xphb.md)—or anything else with exposed fuel—takes a [Bonus Action](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md). Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.
