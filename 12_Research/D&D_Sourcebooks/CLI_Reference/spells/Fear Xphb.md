# Fear
*3rd-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Cone)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a white feather)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each creature in a 30-foot [[Area of Effect Xphb]] must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and have the [[conditions#frightened|Frightened]] condition for the duration.

A [[conditions#frightened|Frightened]] creature takes the [[actions#Dash|Dash]] action and moves away from you by the safest route on each of its turns unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a space where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends on that creature.
