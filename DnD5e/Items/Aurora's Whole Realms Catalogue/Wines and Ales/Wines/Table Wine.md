## Description
This good wine, red or white, is available in bulk as provisioning for a tavern, castle, or manor. I am able to supply it cheaply as shipping costs are kept to a minimum due to numerous local suppliers. Though this wine supplies a merry evening and is unfailingly tasty, I cannot vouch for its even and consistent quality due the nature of local suppliers.
