# Fount of Moonlight
*4th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A cool light wreathes your body for the duration, emitting [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]] in a 20-foot radius and [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] for an additional 20 feet.

Until the spell ends, you have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/resistance-xphb|Resistance]] to Radiant damage, and your melee attacks deal an extra `2d6` Radiant damage on a hit.

In addition, immediately after you take damage from a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself, you can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb|Reaction]] to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Blinded|Blinded]] condition until the end of your next turn.
