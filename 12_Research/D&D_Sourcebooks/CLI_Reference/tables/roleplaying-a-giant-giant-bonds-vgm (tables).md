| dice: d6 | Bond |
|----------|------|
| 1 | My clan is the most important influence on my life, our collective place in the ordning depends on our devotion to one another. |
| 2 | My clan mates who serve in our deity's temples are the closest companions I'll ever know. |
| 3 | My place in the ordning is ordained by our patron deity, and it would be blasphemous to aspire to anything higher or lower. |
| 4 | Though I can never rise above my clan's position in the ordning, I can be a leader among my clan. |
| 5 | My own kind have turned their backs on me, so I make my way among the lesser creatures of the world. |
| 6 | Humans have proven their worth in the world and earned a measure of respect from giantkind. |
