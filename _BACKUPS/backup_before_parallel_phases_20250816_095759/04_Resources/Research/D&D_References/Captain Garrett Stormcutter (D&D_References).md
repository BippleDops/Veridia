Captain Garrett Stormcutter is [[Aquabyssos World Overview|Aquabyssos's most successful "legitimate" merchant, operating from [New Tethys|02 Worldbuilding/Places/New Tethys]] and [[The Wandering Atoll|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Wandering Atoll. He maintains the facade of a profit-driven trader while secretly funding and supplying the [Free Current]] rebellion. Still fully human after 40 years underwater through expensive magical preservation, he refuses adaptation on principle. His weathered face and grey-streaked beard mark him as one of the few who remember the surface world as an adult. ## History

Has been secretly supporting resistance for 30 years while building legitimate business empire. ## Current Activities
