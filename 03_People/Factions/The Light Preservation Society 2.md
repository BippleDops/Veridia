# The Light Preservation Society
*Guardians of Authentic Humanity*

## Overview

The Light Preservation Society represents the largest organized resistance to [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Shadow Conspiracy|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Shadow Conspiracy's continental infiltration efforts. Founded by survivors of early shadow replacement operations and their families, the Society has evolved from desperate support group into sophisticated underground network capable of detecting, documenting, and countering shadow influence across Aquabyssos.

Unlike radical anti-shadow groups that advocate violence or species purification, the Light Preservation Society focuses on preservation, protection, and restoration. Their core mission centers on maintaining records of authentic human identity, developing detection methods for shadow replacement, and providing sanctuary for those fleeing shadow conversion attempts.

The Society operates under the philosophical principle that consciousness and identity represent sacred aspects of human existence that cannot be artificially replicated or improved. They view the shadow conspiracy not as evil, but as a fundamental threat to the diversity and authenticity that makes humanity worthy of preservation.

## Founding and History

### The Great Awakening (8 Years Ago)
**The First Survivors**

The Society's origins trace to a support group formed by Elena Brightmemory, whose husband returned from medical treatment with subtly altered behavior patterns. When Elena discovered evidence of consciousness manipulation, she began seeking others who noticed similar changes in loved ones.

**Initial Discovery Process**:
- Pattern recognition of behavioral changes in returned family members
- Medical investigation revealing gaps in treatment records
