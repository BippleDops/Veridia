She can use this feature 3 times per long rest. **Tide Vision.** Pythia can cast *augury* at will without expending a spell slot. Additionally, she can see 24 hours into the future regarding any single creature she touches, gaining advantage on all rolls related to that creature for the next day. **Depth Communion.** Pythia can communicate with sea creatures and water elementals as if she shared a language. She can also sense the emotional state of any creature that has been underwater in the last 24 hours. **Oracular Trance.** As an action, Pythia enters a trance for 1 minute. During this time, she can ask one question about future events and receives a cryptic but truthful vision. She can use this ability once per day. **Amphibious.** Pythia can breathe air and water. **Spellcasting.** Pythia is a 16th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save **DC 20**, +12 to hit). She has the following spells prepared: **Wizard Spells:**

- Cantrips (at will): *mage hand*, *minor illusion*, *prestidigitation*, *guidance*
- 1st level (4 slots): *detect magic*, *identify*, *comprehend languages*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts*, *locate object*, *see invisibility*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *clairvoyance*, *tongues*, *water breathing*
- 4th level (3 slots): *arcane eye*, *divination*, *locate creature*
- 5th level (2 slots): *commune*, *legend lore*, *scrying*
- 6th level (1 slot): *true seeing*, *find the path*
- 7th level (1 slot): *plane shift*, *etherealness*
- 8th level (1 slot): *feeblemind*, *maze* **Warlock Spells (Pact with the Leviathan):**
- 5th level (3 slots): *hold monster*, *dominate person*, *modify memory* ## Actions **Multiattack.** Pythia casts a spell and uses her Prophetic Strike, or makes two Prophetic Strike attacks. **Prophetic Strike.** *Melee Spell Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (`dice: 2d8` + 6) psychic damage. The target must make a **DC 20** Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of their next turn as they experience a overwhelming vision of their potential deaths. **Tidal Prophecy (1/Day).** Pythia speaks a prophecy that affects all creatures within 60 feet. Each creature must make a **DC 20** Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they are cursed for 24 hours: whenever they make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, they must roll twice and take the lower result. On a success, they are blessed for 24 hours: they can roll twice and take the higher result. **Oracle's Gaze (3/Day).** Pythia fixes her gaze on a creature within 60 feet. The target must make a **DC 20** Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, Pythia learns the creature's deepest secret and the creature is frightened of her for 1 minute. ## Description Pythia Deepgazer appears as a figure suspended between realms and times. Her triton heritage is evident in her blue-green skin that shimmers like sunlight on water and her flowing hair that moves as if perpetually underwater. Her most striking feature is her eyes—completely white orbs that seem to contain swirling galaxies, reflecting visions of what was, what is, and what might be. Standing 5'8" with an ethereal grace, Pythia is draped in flowing robes made from luminescent sea silk that phases between blue, purple, and silver. Bioluminescent patterns spiral across her arms and neck, pulsing in rhythm with her visions. When she speaks prophecies, these patterns flare brilliantly, and her voice takes on a harmonic quality that resonates like whale song. She resides in the Depths of Contemplation, a sacred site where the barriers between present and future are thinnest. Here, surrounded by pools of liquid starlight and crystalline formations that sing with memories of the deep, she receives visitors who seek knowledge of tomorrow's tides. ## Relationships **Allies:**

- **[[The Waking Prophets** - Her order of seers and future-whisperers who interpret omens across both realms
- **[Emperor Thalassius the Wise]]** - She serves as his primary advisor, though her cryptic prophecies often frustrate him
- **[[The Leviathan Prophets** - Ancient entities from the deep trenches who share visions with her in exchange for mortal insights
- **[High Priestess Scylla Deepdream]]** - Theological ally who helps interpret the spiritual meaning of her visions **Enemies:**
- **[[Shadow Parliament** - They fear her ability to see through their schemes and expose their plans
- **[The Biomancers]]** - Her prophecies have repeatedly warned against their experiments
- **Temporal Cultists** - Fanatics who believe the future should remain hidden from mortal eyes **Complicated:**
- **[[Prince Caspian Duskwater** - She has foreseen multiple potential futures for him, some glorious, others tragic
- **[The Party]]** - Her prophecies about them are contradictory and ever-shifting, suggesting they exist at a nexus of possibility ## Quest Hooks 1. **The Shattered Vision** - Pythia's most important prophecy has been fragmented by shadow magic. She needs the party to recover the missing pieces from dangerous locations before a catastrophe she can no longer clearly see comes to pass. 2. **The Temporal Thief** - Someone is stealing moments from time itself, causing Pythia's visions to become increasingly unreliable. She must work with the party to track down this chrono-criminal before reality itself unravels. 3. **The False Oracle** - A charlatan claiming to be the true Tide Oracle is spreading false prophecies for political gain. Pythia needs the party's help to expose the fraud while dealing with the fact that some of the false prophecies are mysteriously coming true. 4. **The Vision Quest** - Pythia foresees that one party member will face a terrible choice that could doom both realms. She offers to guide them through a prophetic journey to understand their destiny and find a third option. 5. **The Silence of the Deep** - The leviathans who provide Pythia with her deepest visions have gone mysteriously silent. She needs brave souls to descend to the deepest ocean trenches to discover what force could frighten such ancient beings. ## Motivations **Primary**: Guide others away from the darkest futures she foresees

**Secondary**: Understand the nature of time and fate in the cosmic scheme
**Hidden**: Prevent the specific apocalypse she witnessed in her deepest vision ## Roleplaying Notes **Personality**: Speaks in riddles and metaphors, often seeming distracted by visions only she can see. Compassionate but sometimes emotionally detached from present concerns. **Ideals**: "Knowledge of the future is a burden that must be borne with wisdom. Not all truths should be spoken, but all paths should be seen." **Bonds**: "I am bound to the flow of time itself, but my heart still remembers what it means to love mortally and fear for others." **Flaws**: "I sometimes become so focused on distant futures that I ignore immediate dangers. My prophecies can be so cryptic as to be useless." **Voice**: Her voice has a lilting, harmonic quality that echoes strangely in enclosed spaces. She often speaks as if addressing multiple people at once, because she sees multiple timeline versions of her conversation partners. **Speaking Patterns**: - "The tides whisper of possibilities..."

- "In seven turns of the moon, or perhaps seventy..."
- "I have seen this face in dreams that have not yet been dreamed..."
- "The future flows like water—it finds the easiest path, but can be diverted..." **Mannerisms**: Her eyes frequently lose focus as visions overlay her present sight. She traces patterns in the air when thinking deeply, and water around her begins to swirl when she's accessing powerful prophecies. She sometimes responds to questions before they're asked, then appears confused when others don't understand the context. ## Player-Facing Summary Oracle is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Oracle as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Oracle. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Hidden Prophecy of Depths ## Plot Hooks - The authorities needs help finding before the festival
