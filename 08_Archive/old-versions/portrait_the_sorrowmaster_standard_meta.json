    "description": "Morteus Grieveheart appears as a figure carved from living sorrow. His deep merfolk heritage shows in his elongated form and pale, almost translucent skin that seems to absorb light rather than reflect it. Standing 6'2\" with an ethereal, gaunt frame, he moves with the slow, measured pace of one who has witnessed countless deaths.\n\nHis most striking features are his eyes—completely black voids that seem to contain the collected tears of every soul he has \"comforted\" in their final moments. His hair flows like dark water, occasionally revealing glimpses of the many mourning symbols braided within. Intricate tattoos of funeral rites spiral across his arms and chest, each one representing a different culture's approach to death and grief.\n\nMorteus dwells in the Grief Gardens, a haunted grove where the water itself seems to weep. Here, surrounded by monuments to the dead and tended by his undead servants, he offers his services to those seeking to commune with lost loved ones—for a price that extends far beyond mere coin.",
