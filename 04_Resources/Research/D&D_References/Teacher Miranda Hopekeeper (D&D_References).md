Founded by [Miranda Hopekeeper]], this institution secretly trains young minds to resist the spreading corruption while maintaining the facade of a traditional underwater academy. Built within a series of interconnected kelp forests and coral chambers, the school serves both surface and aquatic students seeking to understand the true nature of the shadow magic plaguing their world. ## Physical Description The academy is ingeniously constructed within a living kelp forest, with buildings woven from cultivated coral and reinforced kelp fronds. The complex consists of: ### [[Miranda Hopekeeper (Headmistress)

**STR** 10 **DEX** 14 **CON** 14 **INT** 20 **WIS** 18 **CHA** 16 A distinguished half-elf with silver hair that seems to shimmer with its own light.

- **Knowledge Decay**: Books and memories begin to fade, requiring immediate intervention ### Unstable Magic Zones

Student experiments sometimes create hazardous areas:
- **Wild Magic Surges**: Spells cast have 25% chance of triggering wild magic surge

- **Elemental Rifts**: Random portals to elemental planes ### The Headmistress's Office

[Miranda Hopekeeper]]'s private chambers contain:
- **Staff of the Deep** (+2 quarterstaff, water breathing for wielder and 5 others)

**Reward**: 400 gp + magical research assistance ### The Fading Knowledge

Books in the library are mysteriously losing their text. The corruption appears to be targeting knowledge itself. The party must travel to the [[Memory Coral Reefs to restore the lost information.
