- Dark water (heavily obscured beyond 30ft) **Tactics**:
- Ranged attackers maintain height advantage
- Melee fighters use current for mobility
- Controller manipulates battlefield with spells/abilities **Victory Conditions**:
- Defeat all enemies
- Survive 10 rounds
- Reach escape point
- Protect objective ### Leviathan Hunt

**Setup**: Single massive creature in open water
**Enemy**: Leviathan (CR = Party Level +3) **Phases**:
1. **Approach** (100-50ft): Ranged attacks only
2. **Engagement** (50-10ft): Full attacks, Ao E abilities
3. **Desperation** (10ft-0): Grapples, swallow attempts **Environmental Features**:

- No sea floor (infinite depth below)
- Debris field (half cover)
- Thermal layer (obscures vision) **Special Mechanics**:
- Weak points (double damage)

**Setup**: Political enemies strike during negotiation

1. **Negotiation**: Social encounter
2. **Betrayal**: Surprise round for enemies
3. **Chaos**: Full combat
4. Additionally, **Escape/Capture**: Chase scene **Complications**:

- Civilians present (moral choices)
- Political ramifications (killing has consequences)
- Evidence to preserve (for later proof) ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Encounter Builder is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Encounter Builder as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Encounter Builder. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A document has gone missing and truth emerges
