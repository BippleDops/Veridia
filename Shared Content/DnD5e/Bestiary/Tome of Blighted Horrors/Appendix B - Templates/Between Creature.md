# Between Creature
## Overview
### Between Creature

[[43puux4q.rq4.png|open outside]]

A Between creature is infused with the weirdness of Between and is shaped and changed by its environment and experiences. Some [[Appendix A - Between Creatures|Between creatures]] are bizarre versions of existing creatures (such as gargoyles and wyverns), while others are new creatures that don’t have a non-Between equivalent (such as [[Caul Cuckoo|caul cuckoos]] and [[Hyme|hymes]]).

If you need (or just want) more [[Appendix A - Between Creatures|Between creatures]] beyond those presented in the Tome of Blighted Horrors and [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Spells/PHB Spells/A-E/Blight]] adventures, you can create them three ways.

1. Apply a Between simple template to an existing monster stat block. This is quick and simple, and is perfectly adequate for most encounters.

2. Convert an existing creature to the Between subtype using the guidelines presented here. This involves more effort and is better suited to major foes, such as creatures that command groups of lesser, Between minions (which can be converted quickly with the simple [[Appendix B - Templates|templates]]).

3. Create a wholly new Between creature from scratch, following the guidelines below. This is ideal for a powerful villain or recurring foe.

## Between Creature Simple Templates
Although all life in Between is unique, some creatures (wolves, for example) are common to the normal world and Between. The following simple [[Appendix B - Templates|templates]] can be used to turn any creature that does not have the Between subtype into a Between creature. A creature given one of these [[Appendix B - Templates|templates]] counts as a Between creature for the purposes of spells, abilities, and magical items but it does not gain the Between subtype or the many benefits of having the Between subtype — it gains only those benefits specifically described in the simple template.

## Converting an Existing Creature
Most [[Appendix A - Between Creatures|Between creatures]] have the following abilities. (These are already included in the Between creature stat blocks presented in this book). [[Appendix A - Between Creatures|Between creatures]] are highly varied, however, so it’s not a hard-and-fast rule that every Between creature must have these traits or can’t have others.

**Between Age (BA):** Many of a creature’s statistics improve with the length of its exposure to Between. Because a Between creature can’t die of old age, even normally short-lived creatures can become quite powerful through centuries of exposure. These increases are divided into five age categories, according to how long the creature has been exposed to Between: larval, naiadic (15+ years), adult (50+ years), elder (150+ years), and ancient (600+ years). At each age category, a Between creature gains the following cumulative benefits:

+1 to its Dex score;

+1 to one other ability score besides Dex;

+1 Hit Die (added to its hit points, + its Con modifier, as usual)

one feat (if feats are being used in your campaign) or proficiency in one type of saving throw.

**Senses:** A larval creature gains darkvision (30 feet) if it doesn’t already have darkvision. The range increases to 60 feet at naiadic age and to 120

feet at adult. An elder creature gains blindsense (30 feet), and an ancient Between creature has blindsight (60 feet).

**Damage Resistance:** A naiadic creature gains resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. An adult creature gains resistance to cold, force, and poison damage. An elder creature gains resistance to acid, fire, and lightning damage. An ancient creature gains resistance to necrotic, psychic, and thunder damage. All of these gains are cumulative, so an ancient Between creature has resistance to all but radiant damage and bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from magical weapons.

**Magic Resistance:** An adult Between creature has Magic Resistance (1/day, when it fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead). This increases to 2/day for ancient creatures.

Intelligence: If an animal’s Intelligence score is increased above 2, it gains the ability to understand and speak Deep Speech.

**Additional Abilities:** [[Appendix A - Between Creatures|Between creatures]] can have abilities that reflect their habitat, history, environment, and supernatural nature. Adding one such ability per age category is a good benchmark, but it’s not a hard-and-fast rule. These abilities can be adapted from other monsters, drawn from spell-like abilities, or can be new abilities you create. These abilities should be thematically appropriate to the Between and to the creature’s origin. Two new abilities that are especially suited to [[Appendix A - Between Creatures|Between creatures]] are Dislocated and Distorted.

**Dislocated:** The creature’s form is made up of its memories, which shift and change. The creature is continually under the effect of a blur spell (attacks against it are made with tactical disadvantage unless the attacker has blindsight, truesight, or an equivalent). The creature can suppress or reactivate this ability at will as a bonus action.

**Distorted:** A distorted creature’s internal anatomy varies from individual to individual and seldom makes any biological sense. Critical hits against the creature do a flat +1 damage but don’t roll damage dice twice.

**Challenge:** After making all these changes, the creature’s CR should be reevaluated from scratch. As a simpler alternative, just increase the creature’s CR by +1 per Between age category. This will be close enough in most cases, unless the creature gained especially powerful attacks.

## Create a New Creature
Creating a new Between creature is no different from creating any other creature, as described in the GM’s rulebook. It’s easiest if you start by choosing its age category and proceed from there, but do what you’re most comfortable with.
