These foot-tall spirits of nature resemble elves with exaggerated, whimsical features and gossamer wings. Sprites can sense the innate goodness or wickedness of other creatures. Those that enter their realms with good intentions might be treated to tiny feasts and celebrations. The wicked face nasty tricks and bold ambushes at the hands of [[conditions#Invisible|invisible]] sprite defenders. These woodland guardians enchant the arrows of their tiny bows with charming magic that can pierce the heart of the fiercest foe. Sprites oppose any creatures that seek to harm places of natural magic and beauty. This can put them into conflict with would-be settlers, monsters like ettercaps, and despoilers such as goblinoids and hags. They frequently aid other good creatures of the forest, including treants and unicorns, in defending their homes. > [!quote] > > The tree had a wee village nestled in its boughs, I swear. Next thing I knew, I was lyin' face-down in the dirt. My head was full of stars, an' when I stood up an' looked around, both the tree an' the wee village were gone.```statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of sprite xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around sprite xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Second Prophecy of Depths ## Plot Hooks - A map reveals a betrayal about the government
