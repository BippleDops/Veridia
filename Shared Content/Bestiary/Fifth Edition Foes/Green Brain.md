## Description
Green brains are plant creatures grown by myconids and other malevolent races with aptitudes for magically altering and breeding plants. Green brains are reasonably intelligent, psychically potent, and entirely free of personal ambitions or thoughts of freedom, traits that make them useful to their masters for supervising and overseeing the activities of mindless or semi-intelligent creatures. Often the supervised species will be other plant creatures of some kind, but a green brain can also supervise brutish humanoids and other non-plant creatures of low intelligence.

The telepathy of green brains allows them to project mental commands and communication at a deep enough level that the brain’s demands are clear even to mindless creatures such as oozes or monstrous plants. Indeed, the less intelligent the recipient of the orders, the stronger the green brain’s hold over it.
