# Rope
*Adventuring gear*  

- **Cost**: 1 gp
- **Weight**: 5.0 lbs.

As a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action, you can tie a knot with Rope if you succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity ([[skills#Sleight%20of%20Hand|Sleight of Hand]]) check. The Rope can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check.

You can bind an unwilling creature with the Rope only if the creature has the [[conditions#Grappled|Grappled]], [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]], or [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition. If the creature's legs are bound, the creature has the [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition until it escapes. Escaping the Rope requires the creature to make a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]) check as an action.
