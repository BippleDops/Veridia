## Background & Motivations

[[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/People/Harbor Master Luna Freedrift]] is the charismatic and cunning administrator of [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]'s bustling [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Grand Harbor]], one of the most important maritime trade hubs in the known world. Born to an elvish sea captain and a human dock worker, Luna grew up straddling two worldsâ€”the structured hierarchy of maritime law and the rough-and-tumble reality of port life.

### Rise to Power
Luna's path to becoming Harbor Master was unconventional. Originally a smuggler and information broker operating from the docks, she earned her position through a combination of blackmail, genuine competence, and a spectacular public service when she single-handedly prevented a [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Kraken]] attack on the harbor by coordinating the city's defenses while the official Harbor Master cowered in his office. The [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/City Council of Aquabyssos]] recognized her natural leadership and appointed her to the role, much to the chagrin of more traditional candidates.

### Current Authority
As Harbor Master, Luna oversees all maritime traffic entering and leaving [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], manages the complex web of dock fees, shipping schedules, and trade regulations, and serves as the de facto law enforcement for the harbor district. Her authority extends to investigating smuggling, piracy, and other maritime crimes, making her one of the most influential figures in the city's economy.

### The Freedrift Network
Luna maintains her old contacts from her smuggling days, creating an extensive intelligence network that spans from the lowest dock workers to the highest-ranking ship captains. This network, known as the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Freedrift Network]], provides her with information about everything happening in and around [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]'s waters, making her an invaluable ally and a dangerous enemy.

## Current Plots & Hooks

### The Ghost Ship Incident
A mysterious vessel called [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Phantom Current]] has been spotted in [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] waters, seemingly crewed by undead sailors. Luna needs trustworthy agents to investigate without causing panic among the merchant fleet. She suspects the ship is connected to an ancient curse but needs proof before taking official action.

### The Smuggling War
Two rival smuggling operations are escalating their conflict, threatening to spill over into legitimate harbor operations. Luna must maintain plausible deniability while maneuvering the groups into either peace or mutual destruction. She's looking for discrete operatives to handle sensitive negotiations.

### The Deep Trade Routes
Strange reports from deep-sea fishing vessels suggest new trade routes opening to previously unknown civilizations in the ocean depths. Luna wants to establish [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]'s claim to these routes but needs explorers to chart the waters and establish first contact protocols.

### The Harbor Master's Gambit
Political pressure is mounting to replace Luna with a more "traditional" candidate from the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Noble Houses]]. She's building a coalition of supporters while gathering leverage on her opponents, but needs allies who can operate in both legitimate and shadowy circles.

### The Siren's Bargain
A group of [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/People/Sirens]] has approached Luna with a proposal for safe passage through their territorial waters in exchange for certain considerations. The deal could revolutionize shipping routes but comes with moral complications that Luna needs help navigating.
