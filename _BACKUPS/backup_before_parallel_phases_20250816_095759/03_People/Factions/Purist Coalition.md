## Overview
The Purist Coalition opposes all use of Aether Crystals, viewing them as divine punishment for mortal hubris. They seek to destroy all crystals and return [[Aethermoor]] to its pre-Shattering state. What began as peaceful protest has evolved into an organized resistance with extremist cells conducting terrorist attacks.
