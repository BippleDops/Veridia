# The Shadow Markets

*"Where the city's conscience sleeps, its darker appetites wake to feast on forbidden fruit."*

## Overview

The Shadow Markets represent the apex of Aquabyssos's criminal enterprise - a massive underground complex that serves as the central hub for all illegal trade, conspiracy coordination, and underworld governance in the city. Hidden beneath the respectable Merchant Quarter, this sprawling network of chambers and tunnels hosts the most sophisticated black market operation in either realm.

Unlike smaller criminal enterprises that operate in secrecy and fear, the Shadow Markets function as a parallel economy with their own rules, enforcement mechanisms, and social structures. Here, crime is not chaos but commerce - carefully regulated, professionally managed, and surprisingly civilized. The Markets serve not just criminals, but corrupt officials, desperate citizens, and anyone whose needs cannot be met through legitimate channels.
