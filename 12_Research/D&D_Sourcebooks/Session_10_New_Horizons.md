## Opening: Six Months Later

The session begins with a montage showing how the world has changed based on the heroes' convergence choice, followed by the emergence of a new cosmic threat.

### The New World Order

**Scene Setup**: Varies dramatically based on Session 9 outcomes

#### If Worlds Were Separated
> [!info] Separated Worlds Timeline
> The dimensional barriers have solidified into permanent crystal walls. Trade occurs through heavily regulated portal gates. Both worlds have developed new technologies to compensate for lost connections. The heroes are celebrated as saviors but some question if isolation was worth the price.

**Current Challenges**:
- Smuggling operations through unstable micro-rifts
- Cultural stagnation without cross-world inspiration
- Resource shortages affecting both civilizations
- Growing movement to reunite the worlds

#### If Controlled Unity Was Chosen
> [!info] Controlled Unity Timeline
> Complex magical infrastructure maintains stable but limited connections between worlds. A joint council governs inter-dimensional affairs. The heroes serve as advisors but political tensions run high as both worlds struggle with shared governance.

**Current Challenges**:
- Political deadlock in the Joint Council
- Shard energy fluctuations threatening stability
- Emerging nationalist movements in both worlds
- Corruption in the portal management systems

#### If True Merger Occurred
> [!info] Merged Worlds Timeline
> The combined realm shows patches of sky cities floating above underwater districts. New hybrid cultures emerge while traditional ones struggle to adapt. The heroes are founding members of the new world government but face constant crisis management.

**Current Challenges**:
- Environmental disasters from incompatible ecosystems
- Cultural conflicts between surface and depth dwellers
- Economic disruption from merged currencies
- Identity crises among displaced populations

#### If Deep Mother Returned
> [!info] Deep Mother Timeline
> The reformed Deep Mother guides both worlds with benevolent wisdom, but individual agency has diminished. The heroes serve as her chosen representatives but question whether peace achieved through reduced free will is truly victory.

**Current Challenges**:
- Resistance movements fighting against "guidance"
- Heroes questioning their own autonomy
- Discovery that other cosmic entities oppose the Deep Mother
- Gradual erosion of personal choice and creativity

### Meta-Bind Status Tracker

```meta-bind
INPUT[progressBar(minValue(0), maxValue(100)):world-stability]
```

**World Stability Factors**:
- Political unity: `dice: 1d20+5`
- Economic prosperity: `dice: 1d20+3`
- Cultural harmony: `dice: 1d20+2`
- Magical stability: `dice: 1d20+7`

## Investigation Phase: Signs of the Void Lords

Regardless of the convergence outcome, the heroes discover that their victory has attracted attention from entities that exist beyond dimensional boundaries - the [[Void Lords]].

### The First Signs

**Void Manifestations** `dice: 1d6`:
1. **Null Zones**: Areas where magic and life simply cease to exist
2. **Echo Storms**: Temporal distortions showing deleted timelines
3. **Absence Shadows**: Creatures made of pure negation
4. **Reality Tears**: Wounds in existence that resist all healing
5. **Memory Voids**: People forgetting they ever existed
6. **Conceptual Erosion**: Ideas and languages beginning to disappear

### Investigation Opportunities

**Research Path** - [[Academy Alliance Archives]]  
**DC 18 Investigation**: Discover references to "entities beyond creation"  
**DC 20 Arcana**: Understand that Void Lords exist outside the concept of existence itself  
**DC 22 History**: Learn of ancient civilizations that vanished completely from reality

**Political Path** - [[Joint Council Emergency Session]]  
**DC 16 Persuasion**: Convince leaders to take the threat seriously  
**DC 18 Insight**: Realize some officials have been affected by void exposure  
**DC 20 Deception**: Navigate political maneuvering while revealing cosmic threats

**Mystical Path** - [[Shard Resonance Tracking]]  
**DC 15 Religion**: Connect void manifestations to disruptions in cosmic balance  
**DC 19 Arcana**: Trace void incursions to areas of reality stress  
**DC 21 Nature**: Understand how existence itself can be threatened

### Key Revelations

**The Void Lords' Nature**:
- They exist in the spaces between realities
- They view existence as a contamination to be cleansed
- The shard convergence created "reality scars" they can exploit
- They cannot be fought with conventional means

**The Growing Threat**:
- Void incursions are accelerating
- Each reality alteration makes the next easier
- The Void Lords seek to unmake not just worlds, but the concept of existence
- Only unified action across all affected realities can stop them

## Main Event: The Void Incursion

The Void Lords launch a coordinated assault on the heroes' reality, seeking to unravel the changes made during the convergence.

### The Assault on Reality

### Environment: The Battlefield of Existence

**Special Combat Rules**:

**Void Zones** `dice: 1d4+1` appear each round:
- 20-foot radius areas where nothing can exist
- Creatures entering take 3d10 necrotic damage per turn
- Magic items cease functioning in these areas
- Spells cast into void zones simply fail

**Reality Anchors**: Heroes must maintain connection to existence:
- At start of each turn, make DC 15 Wisdom save
- Failure: Gain 1 level of "existential exhaustion"
- 6 levels = character is erased from reality entirely

**Existential Exhaustion Effects**:
1. Disadvantage on attack rolls

### Victory Conditions

**Tactical Victory**: Force retreat by destroying 75% of supporting entities  
**Existential Victory**: Use shard powers to reinforce reality and banish the void

**Special Mechanics for Victory**:
- Heroes can channel shard energies they've encountered
- NPCs from throughout the campaign can provide crucial assistance
- Environmental features can be turned into weapons against void

## Climax: The Choice Beyond Choice

With the immediate threat defeated, the heroes face a final decision about their role in the cosmic order.

### The Revelation

**Brother Marcus the Willing** reveals the ultimate truth:
> "You have done what we thought impossible - not just saved two worlds, but proven that existence itself can be defended. But this is only the beginning. There are infinite realities under threat, and the Void Lords will not stop with just one defeat."

### The Final Choice

**The Cosmic Calling**: The heroes are offered a chance to become interdimensional guardians, protecting all realities from void incursions.

**Option 1: Accept the Calling**
- Heroes become cosmic guardians
- Gain immortality and vast power
- Must leave their home reality behind
- Future adventures span infinite dimensions

**Option 2: Remain Home**
- Heroes stay to protect their world
- Train successors for the cosmic role
- Focus on rebuilding and improvement
- Future adventures remain local but meaningful

**Option 3: Split the Party**
- Some heroes ascend, others remain
- Maintain connection between cosmic and local
- Balanced approach to responsibility
- Complex but rich future possibilities
