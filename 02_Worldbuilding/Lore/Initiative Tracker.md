# Initiative Tracker
*Advanced Combat Organization for the Merged Realms*

> *"In the chaos of battle between realms, victory belongs to those who can think faster than their enemies can act. Track everything, anticipate everyone, and always know whose turn comes next—even when time itself bends around you."*
> — [[Combat Coordinator Master Strike Orderwright]], Tactical Command Specialist

## Overview

The Initiative Tracker provides comprehensive tools and systems for managing complex combat encounters in the merged realms of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]. Unlike standard initiative systems, this framework accounts for environmental factors, multi-dimensional combat, temporal distortions, and the unique challenges of underwater and aerial combat scenarios.

The system addresses several complications unique to the merged realms: pressure effects that can slow actions, crystal resonance that affects reaction times, memory magic that can alter turn order, and reality distortions that may cause combatants to act in multiple time streams simultaneously. These factors require enhanced tracking methods and contingency procedures.

Beyond basic turn order management, the Initiative Tracker integrates with [[Multi-Phase Boss Fights]], [[Environmental Hazards]], [[Temporal Distortion Zones]], and [[Reputation System]] to create a comprehensive combat management framework. The system scales from simple encounters to massive battles involving hundreds of participants across multiple dimensions.

The tracker includes tools for managing complex initiative modifiers, environmental effects, group actions, delayed actions, and the special timing requirements of spellcasting, multi-attack sequences, and legendary actions in the unique physics of the merged realms.

## Core Initiative System

### Standard Initiative Calculation

**Base Initiative**: 1d20 + Dexterity modifier + situational modifiers

**Environmental Initiative Modifiers**:

| Environment Type | Initiative Modifier | Special Conditions |
|------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Surface (Air/Land) | +0 | Standard conditions |
| Shallow Water (0-100ft) | -1 | Familiar aquatic environment |
| Medium Depth (100-1000ft) | -2 | Pressure affects reflexes |
| Deep Water (1000-3000ft) | -3 | Significant pressure impairment |
| Extreme Depth (3000ft+) | -5 | Severe environmental stress |
| Sky Realm (Aerial) | +1 | Enhanced mobility and awareness |
| Crystal Resonance Zone | -2 | Harmonic interference |
| Shadow Wells | -3 | Darkness impairs reaction |
| Reality Merge Zone | Special | See Convergence Rules |
| Temporal Distortion | Special | See Temporal Initiative |

**Adaptation Initiative Modifiers**:

| Adaptation Level | Aquabyssos | Aethermoor | Cross-Realm |
|------------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Native | +2 | +2 | -2 |
| Highly Adapted | +1 | +1 | +0 |
| Moderately Adapted | +0 | +0 | -1 |
| Poorly Adapted | -2 | -2 | -3 |
| Unadapted | -5 | -5 | -5 |

### Initiative Phases and Segments

**Standard Combat Round** (6 seconds):
1. **Surprise Phase** (if applicable)
2. **Initiative Declaration**
3. **Fast Actions** (Initiative 25+)
4. **Standard Actions** (Initiative order)
5. **Slow Actions** (Initiative 10 or lower)
6. **Environmental Effects**
7. **End of Round Effects**

**Extended Combat Segments**:
- **Legendary Actions**: Between other creatures' turns
- **Reactions**: Interrupt normal initiative order
- **Delayed Actions**: Hold action for specific trigger
- **Readied Actions**: Prepared responses to conditions
- **Environmental Actions**: Automatic effects based on location

### Initiative Ties and Resolution

**Tie Resolution Priority**:
1. **Player Characters** (players decide order among themselves)
2. **Friendly NPCs** (GM controls, usually favor players)
3. **Neutral Creatures** (GM discretion)
4. **Hostile Creatures** (GM controls)
5. **Environmental Effects** (always last in tie)

**Complex Tie Situations**:
- **Simultaneous Spells**: Resolve by spell level (higher first), then caster level
- **Identical Creatures**: Use individual Dexterity scores
- **Multi-Form Creatures**: Each form rolls separately
- **Group Actions**: Designated leader rolls for entire group

## Advanced Initiative Mechanics

### Variable Initiative System

**Dynamic Initiative**: Rather than rolling once, initiative changes based on actions taken:

**Action Speed Modifiers**:
- **Fast Actions** (Move, single attack): +5 next round
- **Standard Actions** (Most actions): No modifier
- **Slow Actions** (Full attacks, complex spells): -3 next round
- **Very Slow Actions** (Ritual casting, complex maneuvers): -5 next round

**Momentum System**: Successful actions can grant initiative bonuses:
- **Critical Success**: +2 initiative next round
- **Defeating Enemy**: +1 initiative next round
- **Completing Objective**: +3 initiative next round
- **Saving Ally**: +2 initiative next round

### Multi-Dimensional Initiative

In [[Reality Merge Zones]], combatants may exist across multiple dimensional states:

**Dimensional Initiative States**:
- **Single State**: Normal initiative in one dimension
- **Dual State**: Act in both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor versions of encounter
- **Phase State**: Shift between dimensions, different initiative each
- **Quantum State**: Exist in multiple probability states simultaneously

**Multi-State Initiative Rules**:
- Roll separate initiative for each dimensional state
- Actions in one dimension may affect initiative in others
- Can delay action in one state to coordinate with another
- Dimensional transitions cost initiative (reduce by 5 next round)

### Temporal Distortion Initiative

**Time Effect Categories**:

**Accelerated Time** (Actions happen faster):
- **Minor Acceleration**: Act twice per round at initiative -5
- **Major Acceleration**: Act three times per round at -5 and -10
- **Extreme Acceleration**: Continuous actions, special rules apply

**Decelerated Time** (Actions happen slower):
- **Minor Deceleration**: Act every other round
- **Major Deceleration**: Act every third round
- **Extreme Deceleration**: Act once per minute (10 rounds)

**Fragmented Time** (Inconsistent action timing):
- **Roll 1d6 each round**: 1-2 = No action, 3-4 = Delayed action, 5-6 = Normal action
- **Initiative changes randomly**: Reroll initiative each round
- **Action Echo**: Previous round's action repeats automatically

**Temporal Loop Initiative**:
- **Same Turn Repeats**: Must take identical actions to previous loop
- **Knowledge Retention**: Remember what happened in previous loops
- **Loop Breaking**: Specific actions or conditions end temporal loop
- **Cascade Effect**: Breaking loop affects all temporal effects in area

## Specialized Combat Situations

### Underwater Combat Initiative
