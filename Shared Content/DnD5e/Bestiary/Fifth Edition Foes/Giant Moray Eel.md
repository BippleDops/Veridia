## Special Traits
**Water Dependency:** Giant moray eels can survive out of water for 15 minutes. After that, they begin suffocating.

## Actions
**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (`dice: 2d6+3`) piercing damage and the target is grappled. The grapple is broken if the eel tries to bite a different target.

**Gnaw:** *Melee Attack:* automatic hit, one creature already grappled at the start of the eel's turn. Hit: 12 (`dice: 2d8+3`) piercing damage, and the target must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (`dice: 2d6`) necrotic damage and lose 1 point of Charisma.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Warm aquatic

**Organization**: Solitary or school (4–8)

## Description
The moray eel is a ferocious predator, and its giant cousin even more so. It is capable of holding prey in its primary jaws while a smaller set of inner jaws in its throat takes bites out of the prey. These inner jaws carry a flesh-rotting poison that leaves disfiguring scars. Lost Charisma can be restored with a *greater restoration* spell.
