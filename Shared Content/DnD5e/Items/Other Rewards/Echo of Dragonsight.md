# Echo of Dragonsight
**Type**: Supernatural Gifts
**Group**: Draconic Gift

## Overview: 
You have begun to extend your awareness beyond the single world of the Material Plane that is your home.

You can cast [[contact other plane]] as a ritual. The entity you contact is a dragon on another world in the Material Plane, so its knowledge of your world might be limited. 

Also, this dragon is an echo of the dragon who is the source of the gift, which might affect its attitude and behavior toward you.
