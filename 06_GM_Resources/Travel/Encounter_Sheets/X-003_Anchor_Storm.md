# X-003 Anchor Storm

## Read-Aloud
> Anchors sing to each other across worlds. The air thickens; the sea stills; your teeth tingle with stability.

## Setup
- Twin anchors resonate; cult interference likely

## Mechanics
- Anchorite DC 15 orchestrate; Engineer DC 15 buffer; Group Sanity DC 14

## Outcomes
- Success: Integrity +2 lane; reroll 1 travel hazard today
- Partial: +1 only; Sensor -1 for 1h
- Fail: Integrity -1; one short-term madness

## Integrations
- [[Complete Reality Merger System]]; [[Sanity System]]; faction doctrines

## Quick-Run
- Roll three checks; set Integrity; adjust next encounters accordingly
