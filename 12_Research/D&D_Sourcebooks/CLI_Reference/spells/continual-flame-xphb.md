# Continual Flame
*2nd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

A flame springs from an object that you touch. The effect casts [[bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]] in a 20-foot radius and [[dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] for an additional 20 feet. It looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and consumes no fuel. The flame can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.
