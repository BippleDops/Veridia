## Description
To ensure clean feet and pleasantsmelling [[Footwear|footwear]], we offer cotton, woolen, or flannel stockings. They come short or long, as the buyer desires. Our stockings have warmed the toes of elf and dwarf alike. In fact, one loyal customer once reported finding a slain pack of orcs— all of which were wearing Auroraordered stockings. (They weren’t wearing any after he left.) Demihuman: 1 gp/pair; human: 2 gp/pair.
