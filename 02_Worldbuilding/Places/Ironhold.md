# Ironhold
*The Adamantine Citadel of the Sundered Peaks*

## Overview

Ironhold stands as the greatest dwarven stronghold in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]], carved deep into the heart of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Sundered Peaks]]. This fortress-city has weathered the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Crystallization]] and centuries of conflict, its halls echoing with the sounds of forge-hammers and the songs of ancient clans. Unlike other settlements, Ironhold has largely resisted crystal corruption through traditional dwarven stonework and deep-earth magic.

## Geography & Architecture

### The Mountain Fortress
Built into Mount Ironpeak, the tallest mountain in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Sundered Peaks]], Ironhold descends through thirteen levels carved directly from living stone.
