## Special Traits
***Rampage.*** When the gnoll reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, the gnoll can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The gnoll makes two melee attacks with its spear or two ranged attacks with its longbow.

***Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (`dice: 1d4+2`) piercing damage.

***Spear.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d6+2`) piercing damage, or 6 (`dice: 1d8+2`) piercing damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d8+2`) piercing damage, and the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.

## Description
Hunters are the stealthiest gnolls in a war band, and they put their talents to use on the battlefield in a number of ways. In the vanguard of a war band, hunters creep around, picking off isolated opposition while clearing the way for the rest of the force to run roughshod over the enemy's territory.

Hunters are particularly skilled with the longbow, and they fire arrows with viciously barbed heads. Even when a hunter doesn't kill its target with its first shot, the arrow strike brings so much pain that the victim is hobbled in its attempt to run away. When a hunter on the prowl finds prey and isn't concerned about remaining stealthy, it sounds a horn crafted from bone that produces a keening wail similar to a banshee's yell.
