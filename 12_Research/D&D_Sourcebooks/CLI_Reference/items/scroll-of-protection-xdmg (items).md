*Scroll, rare*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/scroll-of-protection.webp#right)

`dice: [](scroll-of-protection-xdmg.md#^1-creature-type)`

| dice: 1d100 | Creature Type |
|-------------|---------------|
| 01-10 | [[scroll-of-protection-aberrations-xdmg (items)]] |
| 11-15 | [[beast]] |
| 16-20 | [[scroll-of-protection-celestials-xdmg (items)]] |

^1-creature-type

Using a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to read the scroll creates a 5-foot Emanation originating from you. For 5 minutes, creatures of the specified type can't enter or affect anything in the area. However, if you move in such a way that a creature of the specified type would be inside the area, the effect ends.

As a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, a creature within 5 feet of the Emanation can attempt to overcome it, which forces the creature to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the creature ceases to be affected by the Emanation.
