# Eastern Kingdoms
*The Maritime Empire of the Rising Sun*

## Overview

The Eastern Kingdoms represent the largest and most influential political entity in the post-[[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Crystallization world, controlling vast territories across multiple continents through sophisticated naval power and complex diplomatic networks. Unlike the crystal-focused civilizations of [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] or the depth-adapted societies of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos, the Eastern Kingdoms built their power on traditional monarchy, merchant capitalism, and military expansion.

Spanning over 4.2 million square miles across seven major continents and countless islands, the Eastern Kingdoms maintain political unity through the **Imperial Throne of the Rising Sun** while allowing significant regional autonomy. Their influence extends far beyond direct territorial control through trade networks, diplomatic alliances, and strategic military interventions that have shaped global politics for over eight centuries.

The Eastern Kingdoms are unique among world powers for their successful adaptation to the post-crystallization world without fundamental transformation of their social or political systems. While other civilizations underwent radical changes following magical catastrophes, the Eastern Kingdoms absorbed these disruptions and emerged stronger, making them both a stabilizing force and a conservative anchor in an increasingly transformed world.
