# Ice Knife
*1st-level, Conjuration*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/ice-knife.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a drop of water or a piece of ice)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `d10` Piercing damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `2d6` Cold damage.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The Cold damage increases by `d6` for each spell slot level above 1.

**Classes**: [Druid](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard (College of Lore)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
