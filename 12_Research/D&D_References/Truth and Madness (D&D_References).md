Truth and Madness is a living crossroads where memory-currents and trade flows intersect. Merchants, informants, and faiths compete to steer the tides of influence. The Convergence leaves subtle scars here: whispers cling to stone, and bargains echo across depths. ## Player-Facing Summary Truth and Madness is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Truth and Madness as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Truth and Madness. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A letter reveals a conspiracy about the cult
