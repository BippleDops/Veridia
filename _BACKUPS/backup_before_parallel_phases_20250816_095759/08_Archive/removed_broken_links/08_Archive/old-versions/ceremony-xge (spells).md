On a successful check, you restore the target to its original alignment. ## Bless Water You touch one [Vial Xphb]] of water and cause it to become [[Holy Water Xphb. ## Coming of Age You touch one humanoid who is a young adult. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes an ability check, it can roll a`d4`and add the number rolled to the ability check. A creature can benefit from this rite only once. ## Dedication You touch one humanoid who wishes to be dedicated to your god's service. For the next 24 hours, whenever the target makes a saving throw, it can roll a`d4`and add the number rolled to the save. A creature can benefit from this rite only once. ## Funeral Rite You touch one corpse, and for the next 7 days, the target can't become undead by any means short of a [wish-xphb (spells)]] spell. ## Wedding You touch adult humanoids willing to be bonded together in marriage. For the next 7 days, each target gains a +2 bonus to AC while they are within 30 feet of each other. A creature can benefit from this rite again only if widowed. ## Summary **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes *Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 151* ## Player-Facing Summary Ceremony xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of ceremony xge as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around ceremony xge. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A noble needs help delivering before the new moon
