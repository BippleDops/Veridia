# Beholder

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing a beholder's lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Scopophobia.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair feel as if they're being watched. Any creature (excluding the beholder and its allies) that finishes a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb|Short Rest]] while within 1 mile of the lair must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or gain no benefit from that rest.  
- **Warping Terrain.** Minor warps in reality occur near the lair; any creature (excluding the beholder) within 1 mile of the lair that makes a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb|D20 Test]] and rolls a 1 has the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Prone|Prone]] condition.  

If the beholder dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

- An NPC seeks discreet help at beholder xmm to avert a public scandal.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
