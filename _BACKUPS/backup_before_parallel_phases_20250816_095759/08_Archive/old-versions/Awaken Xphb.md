--- # Awaken

*5th-level, Transmutation* - **Casting time:** 8 hours
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (an agate worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous You spend the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, and then touch the target. The target must be either a Beast or Plant creature with an Intelligence of 3 or less or a natural plant that isn't a creature. The target gains an Intelligence of 10 and the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a natural plant, it becomes a Plant creature and gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. The DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened Plant, such as the statistics for the [[awakened-shrub-xmm or [awakened-tree-xmm (plant)]] in the "Monster Manual". The awakened target has the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed condition for 30 days or until you or your allies deal damage to it. When that condition ends, the awakened creature chooses its attitude toward you. **Classes**: [classes]]; [[classes *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 244.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of awaken xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around awaken xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Strange dreams suggest a conspiracy
