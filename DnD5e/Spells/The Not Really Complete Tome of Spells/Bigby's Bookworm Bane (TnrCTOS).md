# Bigby's Bookworm Bane (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *cantrip*

**School**: *Evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a child-sized glove)

**Duration**: 10 minutes


## Effects
You create a Tiny hand out of shimmer-ing, translucent force. This hand immediate-ly seeks out and destroys bookworms and other creatures that eat paper and glue. The *bookworm bane* has a Strength of 6 (-2) and a Dexterity of 12 (+1), so it can open books to seek out insects living inside. When it finds an intrusive creature of no larger than Tiny size, it automatically hits, doing 1 point of damage, which is more than enough to au-tomatically squish a bookworm, roach, mouse, etc. The hand has 4 hit points and will not attack anything larger than Tiny, cannot defend itself, and can perform no other actions.
