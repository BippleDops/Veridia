# Fool's Gold (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *illusion*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a powdered piece of iron pyrite)

**Duration**: 6 hours


## Effects
You touch a pile of up to 150 copper coins or an object made out of copper, brass, or bronze that weighs less than 1 pound, you turn them into gold. When the spell has expired, they revert back to normal.

If one of these altered items is touched with a piece of iron, it has a 25% chance of instantly reverting back to normal.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 4th-level or higher spell slot, the resultant gold objects will not revert if touched with iron.
