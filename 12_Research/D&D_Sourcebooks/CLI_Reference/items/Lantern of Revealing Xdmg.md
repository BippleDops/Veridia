# Lantern of Revealing
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/lantern-of-revealing.webp#right)

While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding [[bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]] in a 30-foot radius and [[dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] for an additional 30 feet. [[conditions#Invisible|Invisible]] creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern's [[bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]]. You can take a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action to lower the hood, reducing the lantern's light to [[dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] in a 5-foot radius.
