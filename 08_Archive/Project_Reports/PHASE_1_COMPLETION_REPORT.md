## üîß Technical Implementation

### Pydantic Integration
```python
# Example: Character Model with Full Validation
class Character(BaseModel):
    id: UUID = Field(default_factory=uuid4)
    name: str = Field(..., min_length=1, max_length=100)
    level: int = Field(1, ge=1, le=20)
    stats: Stats
    inventory: List[Item] = []
    relationships: Dict[str, Relationship] = {}
    
    class Config:
        json_encoders = {
            UUID: str,
            datetime: lambda v: v.isoformat()
        }
```

### Obsidian 1.9.7 Features
