# Hovering Road (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *conjuration*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Self (20-foot road centered on your-self)

**Components**: V, S, M (a chunk of black mar-ble and a loop of gold wire)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 12 hours


## Effects
You create a magical road, 10 feet wide and extending 10 feet ahead of you and 20 feet behind you, and that hovers anywhere from three to thirty feet above the ground, for as long as you continue to walk forward. If you stop walking for longer than 15 minutes, the road slowly sinks and vanishes.

The road is approximately one foot thick and has the texture and color of black marble. It is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum, and is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. If it is destroyed, it turns to black mist, dropping all creatures on it to the ground below.
