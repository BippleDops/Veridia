## Description
For bards who hope for higher occupations, we supply stilts of all lengths. We offer both simple stilts with [[Poles|poles]], handles that run behind the arms, and complex stilts that strap to the calves. (Both are the same price.) Either type uses lightweight, sturdy pine. The heights we carry are 1 ft (2 gp), 2 ft (3 gp), 4 ft (4 gp), 8 ft (6 gp), 12 ft (8 gp), and 20 ft (12 gp). Greater heights can be special ordered.

## Additional Details
requires one hour of practice for each foot off the ground; slows movement by half; requires Dex check each round; regular falling damage applies
