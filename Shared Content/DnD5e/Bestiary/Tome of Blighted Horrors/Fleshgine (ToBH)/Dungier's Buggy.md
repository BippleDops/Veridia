## Overview
### Dungier's Buggy

[[o52p44nb.eyd.png|open outside]]

*The rumble of a coach’s wheels upon the cobbles comes out of the misty night, but it is not accompanied by the clip-clop of hooves. Rather, there is a soft slapping of skin upon the hard stones. Emerging from the fog is a hansom cab drawn not by a team of horses but rather by the upper torso of an ogre melded to the front of the conveyance. It walks on its massive hands, and its head stares forward, the eyes alert but vacant.*

## Special Traits
**Berserk:** Every time the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] is injured in combat, roll `dice: d100`. If the result is less than or equal to the total number of hit points the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] has lost so far in this combat, its elemental spirit breaks free and the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] goes berserk. The berserk [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] attacks the nearest living creature; if no creature is close enough to attack with a single move, it attacks an object instead. The [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]]’s controller can try to reestablish control, provided the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] is within 60 feet. The controller must use an action to speak firmly and authoritatively to the construct and make a successful DC 15 Charisma check. A damaged [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] that spends at least 1 minute outside combat has its chance to go berserk reset to 0 percent.

**Cover:** The coach portion of a Dungier’s buggy provides three-quarters cover to occupants. The coach is built from iron and wood. It has AC 8, 80 hit points, and is immune to necrotic, poison, psychic, and radiant damage. If the coach is destroyed, the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] becomes a Large creature and loses its Cover, Facing, and Trample traits.

**Facing:** Because the legless ogre is permanently melded to a wagon, it can only move forward and backward, or turn. Its speed is halved when it moves backward. Its slam and bite attacks can be made only against targets in front of it. It can trample while moving forward or backward. behind it as normal. Once a Dungier’s buggy’s front side has been determined, it requires a move action to turn its facing greater than 90 degrees. A Dungier’s buggy is aware of attackers behind it but cannot see them, though it can accurately estimate what space they are in if within 20 feet.

**Narrow:** Though a Dungier’s buggy is Huge, it can move through areas only 10 feet wide without penalty. It can’t, however, squeeze through spaces narrower than 10 feet.

**Trample:** As the Dungier’s buggy moves, it can enter spaces occupied by enemies but can’t stop there. Creatures in spaces the Dungier’s buggy enters can attempt DC 13 Dex saving throws. On a failed save, the creature takes `dice: 2d10 + 4` bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone; on a successful save, the creature moves 5 feet out of the buggy’s path and can make an opportunity attack if it’s allowed to react. A Dungier’s buggy can trample any number of creatures during its move, but it can’t trample the same creature more than once per round.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The Dungier’s buggy slams once and bites once.

**Melee Attack—Slam:** +6 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d6 + 4` bludgeoning damage.

**Melee Attack—Bite:** +6 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d4 + 4` piercing damage.

## Description
**Environment**: Urban (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Spells/PHB Spells/A-E/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary

Perhaps the most successful of Castorhage’s many [[Fleshgine|fleshgines]] are the hired coaches of the golem-stitcher Dunaven Dungier. His method of crafting a hansom cab with the animated upper torso of an ogre (occasionally a hill giant) fused to its front in place of a team of horses proved both practical and popular in a city as vast and populous as the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Spells/PHB Spells/A-E/Blight]]. Soon Dungier’s buggies were traveling throughout the city providing swift, reliable transportation for the noble and common alike and for only a modest fare. Dungier’s popularity with the other cab drivers and owners of hacks proved to be less than stellar, though, and only three years after the introduction of his ingenious cab, portions of his body were found floating in the Great Canal. It is assumed that [[Sough-Eel|sough eels]] or some other denizen devoured the rest. Fortunately for his legacy, Dungier’s methods were fairly easy to reproduce, and now hundreds of these coaches — still known colloquially as Dungier’s buggies — travel the streets of the city.
