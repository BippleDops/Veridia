## Description
Though any ranger worth his salt can cobble together a sufficient animal trap in half an hour, most such traps tend to be lethal or torturous in nature. By contrast, we offer both live and lethal traps. Our live traps come in three sizesâ€”rabbit (4 gp, 3 lb), boar (7 gp, 8 lb), and bear (12 gp, 15 lb), all of which can be set up in ten minutes. Our lethal trap (10 gp) works on any size of animal and is mercifully swift. These baited traps contain opposing blades that spring closed when an animal comes to feed, decapitating it instantly.
