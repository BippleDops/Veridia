## Actions
**Multiattack:** A deep hunter attacks once with its tail and either bites or uses its swallow attack.

**Bite:*** Melee Attack*: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 18 (`dice: 2d12+5`) piercing damage plus 11 (`dice: 2d10`) poison damage, and the target must make a successful DC 18 Strength saving throw or be grappled and restrained. If the target of this attack is already grappled by the sea serpent, the attack hits automatically but the target repeats the saving throw; if the save succeeds, the target escapes from the grapple and restraint, but if the save fails, the target is swallowed (see above). A deep hunter can have up to two creatures grappled at a time.

**Swallow (Recharge 5—6):** *Melee Attack:* automatic hit, reach 5 ft., one creature grappled by the deep hunter. Hit: the target must make a successful DC 18 Strength saving throw or be swallowed. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained. It takes 18 (`dice: 2d12+5`) piercing damage immediately, and another 13 (`dice: 3d8`) bludgeoning damage plus `dice: 2d8` acid damage automatically at the start of each of the sea serpents turns. Up to two Large creatures and any number of smaller creatures can be inside the deep hunter at one time. A swallowed creature is unaffected by anything happening outside the deep hunter or by attacks from outside it. A swallowed creature can get out of the deep hunter by using 15 feet of movement, but only after the sea serpent is dead.

**Tail Slap:** *Melee Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 16 (`dice: 2d10+5`) bludgeoning damage and the target is pushed 10 feet away from the sea serpent.

**Coiling Maneuver:** +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: the target must make a successful DC 18 Strength saving throw or be grappled and restrained by the sea serpent. A deep hunter can have up to two creatures grappled at a time.

**Unhinge Jaw:** The sea serpent can try to recharge its swallow attack. Roll `dice: 1d6`; the attack recharges on a roll of 5 or 6.

**Tail Attack:** The sea serpent uses its tail attack against a target within reach.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any aquatic

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
The sea serpents, great snakelike creatures that have roamed the oceans for ages, are nearly as old as the dragons that roam the sky. Unlike dragons, these great, scaly, serpentine beasts are products of natural evolution, though many scholars suspect magical influence, either deliberate or natural, somewhere in their evolution.

Sea serpents display great variation in size, color, intellect, and temperament. All of them, however, bear certain similarities. They are long, serpentine, warmblooded creatures that resemble snakes in appearance, though they also have two sets of flippers. On some sea serpents, these flippers are large and powerful, while on others they are so small and atrophied as to be almost unnoticeable. All sea serpents are aquatic, as their name implies, but they can survive for extended times out of water and some can even make their way about on land. Furthermore, all sea serpents are sentient, with intellects ranging from that of a smart dolphin to levels rivaling the smartest humans.

One trait that sea serpents share with dragons is a sense of innate superiority, a feeling that they are unequalled, unchallenged masters of the sea.

Unlike dragons, sea serpents are not distinguished by color or age. A few species are as acquisitive as dragons, but most have no interest in hoarding wealth or surrounding themselves with worshipful, lesser creatures. All sea serpents can speak and understand Aquatic, and many know Draconic as well. The more intelligent among them often learn the languages of nearby marine civilizations or the languages of seagoing surface dwellers.

In combat, most sea serpents use similar tactics. All have venomous bites, and all have the ability to trap prey in their coils and crush the life out of them the way a giant constrictor snake does. The largest sea serpents can even crush ships this way; mariners in their smoky dens delight in recounting tales of horror about great serpents that splintered mighty hulls and then gulped down the helpless sailors as they splashed in the water or sank into the brine.

Because they are intelligent, sea serpents can often be reasoned with or bargained with, if the bargainer has something the sea serpent wants and approaches as a supplicant, not an equal. They are adaptable to circumstances and never throw themselves into battle rashly.

The immense deep hunter sea serpent lives in the deepest parts of the ocean, where it delights in hunting down and killing the most fearsome creatures of the sea. Its preferred prey is giant squids, the largest whales, and sometimes even other sea serpents—only the long-slumbering kraken is more feared than this monstrous predator of the sea. Its lair usually is near thermal vents or underwater volcanoes, where the water is very warm. When hunting, however, it can be encountered anywhere at sea.

Thankfully, the deep hunter seldom comes to the surface, because its favorite prey sticks to deep water. When one is sighted on the surface, rumors of its presence can cause shipping to reroute thousands of miles out of its way to avoid deep hunter-infested water, or to not venture out of port at all. Such a sighting is a calamity for commerce, but also a great opportunity for the few sea captains brave enough to risk a trip through a deep hunter’s territory (and charismatic enough to find a crew that will share the risk).
