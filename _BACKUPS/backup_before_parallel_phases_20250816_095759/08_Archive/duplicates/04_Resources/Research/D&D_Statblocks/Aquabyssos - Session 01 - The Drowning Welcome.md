The party arrives in Aquabyssos via Pressure Tube, experiencing molecular liquification and reconstitution. Upon arrival at the Inverse Palace, they witness Senator Hadrian dissolve into living shadow during a Parliament session. Their own shadows begin showing signs of independence as they settle into their inverted quarters. ### Opening Scene

**Location:** [[Abyssos Prime
**Time:** Midday (though sunlight doesn't reach here)
**Description:** The party materializes from liquid form in the Pressure Terminal's reconstitution chambers. One member's shadow reforms a second late, moving independently for just a moment. Terminal guards check "molecular integrity" while making notes about shadow irregularities. Graffiti in Aquabyssos script on the walls reads: "The Harvest Comes." > **Read Aloud:** "Your consciousness snaps back like a rubber band as your body reconstitutes from liquid. The sensation is wrongâ€”like being poured into a mold that doesn't quite fit. As you solidify, you notice your shadow on the curved glass wall. For just a moment, it waves while your hand remains still." #### Event 1: The Emperor's Court

**Location:** [Throne of Bubbles]]
**NPCs:** [[The Scattered Emperor, [Marina Red Tide Coralheart - Aquabyssos (D&D_References)]]
**Pressure Check:** **DC 12** CON save or gain 1 exhaustion
**Outcome:** - Emperor speaks through electric eel collective
- Each eel contains personality fragment
- Warning about shadows: "Trust nothing that casts shadows"
- Marina introduced as adapted guide
- Bubbles containing last breaths reveal shadow murders **Emperor's Fragmented Dialogue:**
- Eel 1: "Weâ€”"
- Eel 2: "â€”welcomeâ€”"
- Eel 3: "â€”you butâ€”"
- Eel 4: "â€”trust nothingâ€”"
- Eel 5: "â€”that castsâ€”"
- Eel 6: "â€”shadows." #### Event 2: The Dissolution

**Location:** [[Parliament of Echoes - Public Gallery
**NPCs:** [Senator Glaucus]], dissolving Senator Hadrian
**Witness Horror:** **DC 13** WIS save or frightened for 1 minute
**Outcome:**
- Senator Hadrian screams and melts into living shadow
- Shadow attacks other senators before escaping
- Senator Glaucus laughs inappropriately
- Other senators seem unsurprised by timing
- Party's shadows twitch during event **Investigation Clues:**
- Shadow left behind senator's skin like shed clothes
- Glaucus's shadow makes different gestures than him
- Three senators carefully avoid looking at shadows
- Guards at Shadow Checkpoint were absent #### Event 3: Quarters Assignment

**Location:** [[Inverted Ballroom Wing
**Investigation DC:** 15 to find previous ambassador's journal
**Shadow Check:** **DC 10** WIS to notice shadow irregularities
**Outcome:**
- Rooms have inverted gravity (walk on ceiling)
- Previous ambassador's journal: "I am no longer casting it"
- Mirrors show shadows performing different actions
- Evidence someone entered rooms before arrival
- Waterfalls flow upward into ceiling pools ### Closing Scene

**Location:** [Inverted Ballroom Wing - Party Quarters]]
**Time:** Night cycle (artificial darkness)
**Cliffhanger:** Party members wake to find their shadows standing at the foot of their beds, perfectly still, watching them. One shadow holds a knife. Marina bursts in: "Don't move. Don't even breathe. If you acknowledge them, they become real." Through the window, dozens of shadows dance in the Inverted Ballroom without their owners. ### Environmental Challenges
