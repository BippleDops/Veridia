# Rescue Senator Glaucus

**Type:** Rescue/Political Intrigue  
**Level:** 1-5  
**Location:** [[The Sunken Markets]], [[Parliament of Echoes]], [[Smuggler's Cove]]  
**Duration:** 2-3 sessions  
**Threat:** A key political figure has been kidnapped to destabilize [[Aquabyssos]] democracy

## Overview
[[Senator Glaucus]], a moderate voice in the [[Parliament of Echoes]] and key supporter of surface-depth cooperation, has vanished during a routine visit to [[The Sunken Markets]]. His disappearance threatens to collapse delicate peace negotiations between [[Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos]]. Time is running out as political extremists on both sides use his absence to push for war.

## Background
Senator Glaucus was investigating reports of illegal [[Shadow Surgeons Collective]] operations in the market district when he disappeared. Security footage from [[Pressure Tubes]] shows him entering a seemingly legitimate memory merchant's stall, but he never emerged. His bodyguards were found days later, their memories completely wiped.

## Key NPCs
- **[[Senator Glaucus]]**: Moderate politician, expert negotiator, secretly dying from pressure poisoning
- **[[Shadow Merchant Riptide]]**: Ruthless trader who arranged the kidnapping for political gain
- **[[Memory Merchant Zephyr Mindweaver]]**: Reluctant accomplice with crucial information
- **[[Commander Drake Pressureborn]]**: Military leader demanding immediate action
- **[[Mediator Serenity Stillwater]]**: Desperate diplomat trying to prevent war
- **[[Admiral Thorne Blackwater]]**: Naval commander coordinating search operations
- **[[Elena Starweaver]]**: Crystal mage investigating magical aspects of the kidnapping
- **Detective Coral Truthseeker**: [[Parliament of Echoes]] investigator with inside knowledge
- **[[Vault Keeper Eternal]]**: Ancient guardian who may have witnessed similar incidents
- **Nurse Tidal Mercy**: Medical professional treating pressure poisoning symptoms
- **[[The Recursion Oracle]]**: Seer whose visions might reveal the Senator's location

## Investigation Phase

### Phase 1: The Senator's Last Steps (1 session)
**Location:** [[The Sunken Markets]]  
**Objective:** Trace the senator's movements and identify suspects

**Key Locations to Investigate:**
- **Memory Merchant Stalls**: Several report unusual "bulk orders" for political memories
- **[[Pressure Tube Terminal]]**: Security constructs have partial recordings
- **[[The Depth Market]]**: Black market dealers may have seen something
- **Senator's Office**: Contains evidence of his investigation into shadow surgeries

**Clues to Discover:**
1. **Scheduled Meeting**: Glaucus had an appointment with "Merchant Zephyr" at Stall 7-Beta
2. **Modified Pressure Suits**: Someone has been altering suits to hide identity markers
3. **Memory Residue**: Psychic traces of fear and confusion around the merchant stalls
4. **Financial Records**: Large payments made to shadow surgery facilities
5. **Temporal Disturbances**: Minor time anomalies suggest magical transportation

### Phase 2: Following the Trail (1 session)
**Location:** [[Shadow Market Canals]], [[Smuggler's Cove]]  
**Objective:** Navigate the criminal underworld to find the kidnapping network

**Challenges:**
- **Trust Issues**: Criminals won't talk without proof of reliable payment or protection
- **Shadow Surgery Traps**: Areas booby-trapped with memory-altering magic
- **Rival Investigators**: Other parties (both legitimate and criminal) seeking the senator
- **Time Pressure**: Every hour increases the chance of permanent memory damage

**Key Encounters:**

- **Former Shadow Surgery Patient**: Victim who escaped, has inside knowledge
- **[[Coral Throne Syndicate]] Enforcer**: Wants the senator found to maintain stability
- **Crooked Pressure Tube Operator**: Accepting bribes to alter transport logs

## The Rescue Location: Hidden Surgical Facility

### Facility Layout
**Location:** Converted section of [[Ancient Siege Tunnels]] beneath [[The Sunken Markets]]  
**Security:** Memory-locked doors, emotional manipulation traps, shadow construct guards

**Key Areas:**
1. **Reception Chamber**: Disguised as legitimate memory therapy clinic
2. **Holding Cells**: Where victims await "treatment"
3. **Surgery Theater**: Where memories are extracted and altered
4. **Storage Vaults**: Crystalline containers holding stolen memories
5. **Escape Routes**: Emergency tunnels leading to [[The Cerulean Trench]]

### Facility Defenses
- **Memory Scramblers**: Devices that confuse intruders' recollections
- **Emotion Dampeners**: Suppress courage and determination
- **Shadow Guards**: Constructs made from extracted fear and anger
