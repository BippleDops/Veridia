# Hail of Stone (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *1st-level*

**School**: *conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 300 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of jade worth at least 5 gp)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
A storm made of stones appears in a location you choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 5-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least once face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one, each round that the creature ends its turn in the storm.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
