# Shadow Ambush - Optional

## Overview
Shadow Ambush - Optional (SAO) is an elite military unit within the [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] armed forces, specializing in ambush tactics, guerrilla warfare, and surgical strikes against high-value targets. Unlike traditional military formations that rely on direct confrontation, SAO operates using stealth, misdirection, and precisely timed assaults to achieve maximum impact with minimal casualties.
