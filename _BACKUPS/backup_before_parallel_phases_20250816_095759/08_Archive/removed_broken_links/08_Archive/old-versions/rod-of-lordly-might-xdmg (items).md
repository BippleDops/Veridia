--- # Rod of Lordly Might

*Rod, legendary (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/rod-of-lordly-might.webp#right) - **Weight**: 2.0 lbs. This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic Mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Buttons You can press one of the following buttons as a [[Action Xphb; a button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form: - **Button 1.** A fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head. The flames shed [Light Xphb]] in a 40-foot radius and [[Light Xphb for an additional 40 feet, and the blade functions as a magic Longsword or Shortsword (your choice) that deals an extra``dice: 2d6``Fire damage on a hit. - **Button 2.** The rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. - **Button 3.** The rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic Spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. - **Button 4.** The rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long (you specify the length), though the rod's buttons remain within your reach. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form. - **Button 5.** The rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength ([skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers. - **Button 6.** The rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it. ## Drain Life When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a **DC 17** Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an extra``dice: 4d6``Necrotic damage, and you regain a number of [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules) equal to half that Necrotic damage. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn. ## Paralyze When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a **DC 17** Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the [conditions#Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] condition for 1 minute. The target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn. ## Terrify While holding the rod, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself to make a **DC 17** Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a target has the [conditions#frightened|Frightened]] condition for 1 minute. A [[conditions#frightened|Frightened]] target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 300.
