# Enspelled Staff (Cantrip)
*Staff, weapon, uncommon (requires attunement by a Spellcaster)*

  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning

- **Properties**: [[item-properties#Versatile|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

Bound into this staff is a cantrip. The cantrip is determined when the staff is created and can be of any school of magic. The staff has 6 charges and regains `d6` expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 charge to cast its spell. If you expend the staff 's last charge, roll `d20`. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical [[quarterstaff-xphb|Quarterstaff]].

The spell's saving throw DC is 13, and its attack bonus is `+5`.
