--- # Horn of Valhalla, Bronze

*Wondrous item, very rare* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/horn-of-valhalla.webp#right) You can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you. Each spirit uses the [[Bestiary]] stat block and returns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]]. The spirits look like living, breathing warriors, and they have [[immunity-xphb (variant-rules)]] to the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] and [[conditions#frightened|Frightened]] conditions. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed. A bronze horn summons 4 [[Bestiary]]. To use the bronze horn, you must have training with all Medium armor. If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned [[Bestiary]] attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are [[friendly-attitude-xphb (variant-rules)]] to you and your allies and follow your commands. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 270.
