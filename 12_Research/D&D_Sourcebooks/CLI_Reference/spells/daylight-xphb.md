# Daylight
*3rd-level, Evocation*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/daylight.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration, sunlight spreads from a point within range and fills a 60-foot-radius [[sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]]. The sunlight's area is [[bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]] and sheds [[dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] for an additional 60 feet.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the sunlight to fill a 60-foot [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the sunlight.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of [[darkness-xphb|Darkness]] created by a spell of level 3 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.

## Adventure Hooks

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
