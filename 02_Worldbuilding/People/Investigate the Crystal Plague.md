## Overview
A mysterious crystalline disease is spreading through Aethermoor, transforming victims into living crystal statues while maintaining their consciousness. The government has quarantined affected areas, but the plague continues spreading. Investigators must uncover its source and find a cure before the entire city succumbs.

## Quest Giver
**High Healer Seraphina Goldlight** - Desperate to save her transformed patients, offers 10,000 gp plus access to exclusive healing magic for finding the plague's source and cure.

## Symptoms and Progression
**Stage 1:** Skin develops crystalline patches, minor stiffness
**Stage 2:** Crystal growth spreads, movement becomes difficult
**Stage 3:** Major body parts fully crystallized, speech impaired
**Stage 4:** Complete transformation, conscious but immobile
**Stage 5:** Unknown - no one has survived this long

## Investigation Leads
1. **Patient Zero Location:** Abandoned crystal mine outside city
2. **Common Factors:** All victims visited specific merchant district
3. **Crystal Analysis:** Unknown mineral composition defying identification
4. **Magic Resistance:** Divine healing accelerates rather than cures
5. **Pattern Recognition:** Plague follows underground water system

 ## Key Encounters
- **Quarantine Zone Infiltration** (Stealth) - Accessing restricted areas
- **Crystal Zombie Swarm** (Combat CR 8) - Fully transformed victims
- **Mad Alchemist Researcher** (Social/Combat CR 7) - Plague researcher gone insane
- **The Source Entity** (Combat CR 10) - Aberrant crystal creature
- **Time Pressure** (Environmental) - Plague spreads daily

## The Truth
The plague originates from experiments with Far Realm crystals that escaped containment. A research team led by Magus Cornelius Vex was attempting to create permanent magical enhancement crystals but instead opened a dimensional rift.

## Multiple Solutions
**Destroy Source:** Collapse the mine and seal the rift permanently
**Purification Ritual:** Use opposing elemental forces to cleanse crystals
**Temporal Reversal:** Magical time manipulation to undo the outbreak
**Transformation Acceptance:** Help victims adapt to crystal form
**Evacuation:** Abandon affected areas and relocate population

## Rewards
10,000 gp, Staff of Greater Healing, Crystal of Protection, government honors
