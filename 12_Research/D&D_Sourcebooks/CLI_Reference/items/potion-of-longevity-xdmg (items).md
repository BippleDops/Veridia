# Potion of Longevity
*Potion, very rare*  

- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, your physical age is reduced by `1d6 + 6` years, to a minimum of 13 years. Each time you subsequently drink a Potion of Longevity, there is 10 percent cumulative chance that you instead age by `1d6 + 6` years.

Suspended in this amber liquid is a tiny heart that, against all reason, is still beating. These ingredients vanish when the potion is opened.
