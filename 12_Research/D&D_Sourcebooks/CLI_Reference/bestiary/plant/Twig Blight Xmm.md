# [[Twig Blight Xmm]]
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 43*  

Resembling bundles of sticks or dead brush, twig blights easily blend in among deadwood, flotsam, and the wood piles common in many rural settings. Groups of them are often found near river crossings, forgotten wells, or natural campsites, where they ambush those who let down their guard.

## Blights

*Plants Sprouted from Evil*

- **Habitat.** Forest  
- **Treasure.** None  

Blights are malicious plants that sprout from deep-rooted evil. Their gnarled forms twist with fearsome features suggestive of human limbs and vicious maws. Blights lurk in ambush amid mundane vegetation and lash out at non-Plant creatures. While blights can act independently, they're usually motivated by whatever sinister forces spawned them or by wicked creatures with control over nature. The magic that creates blights often affects other vegetation as well, causing brambles, vines, and gnarled trees to overwhelm roads and fields, choke wells and streams, and force animals from their natural habitat. This might make blights the first sign of an oncoming wave of corruption.
