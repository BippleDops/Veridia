## Description
The tailer performs for the back what the [[Loin Guard|loin guard]] does for the front. With a tailer secured to one’s [[Broadbelt|broadbelt]], an adventurer needn’t fear attacks from behind—at least from halflings and kobolds. Our tailers are rigid plate mail but comfortable all the same; in fact, with a long tailer and [[Loin Guard|loin guard]] and a suitable [[Broadbelt|broadbelt]], one could sit down without a chair.

## Additional Details
