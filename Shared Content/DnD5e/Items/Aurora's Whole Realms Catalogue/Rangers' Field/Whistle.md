## Description
The forest is filled with innumerable birds and beasts, some of whom you may wish to attract, and some of whom you may wish to repel. We offer whistles and calls for both purposes. Those that attract creatures produce the sound pleasing to the creature’s ear (mating call or sound of prey); those that repel create an unpleasant sound (distress call or cry of enemy). All our animal calls cost 1 gp. Please specify which creature you wish to attract or repel: badger, bat, bear, boar, cat, deer, dog, eagle, hawk, horse, mountain lion, owl, rat, snake, sparrow, wolf, wren.

## Additional Details
90% chance to attract/repel friendly creatures; 70% on indifferent; 50% on cautious; 30% on threatening; 10% on hostile; 0% if none in ½ mile radius
