# Difficulty Class
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 366. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A Difficulty Class (DC) is the target number for an ability check or a [[saving-throw-xphb|saving throw]].

## Player-Facing Summary

Difficulty class xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of difficulty class xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around difficulty class xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties difficulty class xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at difficulty class xphb to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to difficulty class xphb active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
