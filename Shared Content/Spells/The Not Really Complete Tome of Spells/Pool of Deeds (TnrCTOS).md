# Pool of Deeds (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *divination*

**Casting Time**: 1 hour

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a handful of colored powder)

**Duration**: 24 hours


## Effects
You turn a pool of water that is anywhere from 1 foot to 30 feet in diameter as a story-teller. It shows, in images only, the deeds of any one person you name, living or dead. You must name which deeds you wish to see (i.e., the deeds must be publically known), but the pool will show even unknown de-tails. It will show the event in realtime. If there are details that the named person does or did not want known, you must make a DC 18 Intelligence check to reveal them.
