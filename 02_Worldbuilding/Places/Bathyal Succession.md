# Bathyal Succession

*"When the throne beckons from the deepest depths, who will answer the call?"*

## Overview
The Bathyal Succession is a complex political crisis unfolding in Aquabyssos as the current ruler's health fails and multiple claimants vie for the throne. This succession dispute threatens to tear apart the underwater kingdom's fragile political stability.

Unlike surface kingdoms with clear primogeniture laws, Aquabyssos follows ancient traditions where the worthiest candidate must prove themselves through trials in the deepest ocean trenches - the bathyal zones where few can survive.

## The Crisis
Emperor Nereon the Deep-Sworn has ruled for forty years, but recent corruption exposure has weakened him considerably. With no clear heir designated and his condition deteriorating, three major factions have emerged to claim the throne.

## Succession Claimants
**Prince Abyssos the Bold**: Eldest son, military commander, traditionalist
**Princess Pelagia the Wise**: Second child, diplomat, reformist
**Duke Hadean the Forgotten**: Distant cousin, shadow broker, opportunist

## The Trials
Traditional succession requires candidates to complete three challenges:
1. **Trial of Depths**: Survive 72 hours in the deepest trenches
2. **Trial of Wisdom**: Solve an ancient riddle posed by the Deep Oracles
3. **Trial of Command**: Lead a military expedition against a chosen threat

## Political Factions
**The Deep Guard**: Military traditionalists supporting Prince Abyssos
**The Progressive Current**: Reformers and diplomats backing Princess Pelagia
**The Shadow Tide**: Criminal elements and opportunists behind Duke Hadean
**The Neutral Depths**: Undecided nobles waiting to see who emerges strongest

## Current Tensions
- Increasing incidents of sabotage between factions
- Foreign powers attempting to influence the outcome
- Economic instability as trade partners grow nervous
- Rising criminal activity as law enforcement is distracted
- Protests and civil unrest in outer districts

## Key Locations
**The Deepest Court**: Where succession trials are officially declared
**Bathyal Testing Grounds**: Dangerous trenches used for depth trials
**The Assembly of Currents**: Political body overseeing succession law
**Safe Houses**: Hidden locations where factions plan their moves

## Timeline
The succession process is expected to take 3-6 months, with each phase potentially creating new crises or opportunities for intervention.

## Impact on Daily Life
- Increased security checkpoints throughout the city
- Trade disruptions as merchants avoid political risks
- Rising prices for basic goods due to uncertainty
- Recruitment drives by various factions
- Increased crime as law enforcement is stretched thin

## Adventure Hooks
1. Players hired as bodyguards for one of the claimants
2. Investigation into succession-related sabotage
3. Diplomatic mission to secure foreign support
4. Race to recover ancient succession artifacts
5. Preventing assassination attempts on multiple targets

## Potential Outcomes
**Legitimate Victory**: One claimant completes all trials and gains broad support
**Civil War**: Multiple claimants refuse to accept trial results
**Foreign Intervention**: External powers install their preferred candidate
**Revolutionary Change**: Common citizens reject monarchy entirely
**Shadow Victory**: Duke Hadean manipulates trials through criminal networks
