## Player-Facing Summary

NPC Generator is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of NPC Generator as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around NPC Generator.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.

## Plot Hooks

- The authorities needs help stealing before the festival
- An heirloom has gone missing and evil awakens
- A map reveals the truth about the cult
- Someone is protecting a artifact for love
