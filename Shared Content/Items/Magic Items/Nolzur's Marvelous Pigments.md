## Description
Typically found in `dice: 1d4` (1d4) pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional [[11 - Objects|objects]] by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.

Each pot of paint is sufficient to [[16 - Cover|cover]] 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate [[11 - Objects|objects]] or terrain features—such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or [[3 - Weapons|weapons]]— that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 [[7 - Time|minutes]] to [[16 - Cover|cover]] 100 square feet.

When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of [[11 - Objects|objects]] you create.

Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.

If you paint a form of energy such as [[17 - Damage and Healing|fire]] or [[17 - Damage and Healing|lightning]], the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.
