# Deep Work Prompt: Comprehensive TTRPG Vault Analysis & Optimization

## Context & Objective
You are tasked with performing a deep, comprehensive analysis and optimization of this Obsidian TTRPG vault containing two interconnected D&D 5e campaigns (Aethermoor and Aquabyssos). This vault has ~5,600 files and has undergone initial cleanup but requires expert-level optimization based on current best practices.

## Phase 1: Deep Contextual Analysis (Read Everything First)

### 1.1 Campaign Context Absorption
**Task**: Read and fully understand the campaign setting before making any changes.

**Required Reading Order**:
1. `_WORLD_SUMMARY.md` - Understand the dual-world setting
2. `_CAMPAIGN_CONTEXT.md` - Current campaign state
3. `_AI_CONTEXT.md` - Themes and tone
4. Both campaign overviews in `01_Campaigns/*/[Campaign] Campaign Overview.md`
5. At least 3 sessions from each campaign to understand narrative flow
6. Sample NPCs from each campaign to understand character depth

**Deliverable**: Create `_CAMPAIGN_DEEP_ANALYSIS.md` documenting:
- Core narrative threads and their interconnections
- Character relationship webs (who knows whom and why)
- Timeline consistency across both worlds
- Unresolved plot threads that need attention
- Thematic consistency analysis
- Opportunities for deeper world integration

### 1.2 Structural Analysis
**Task**: Map the entire vault's information architecture.

**Analysis Points**:
- Document every folder's actual purpose vs intended purpose
- Identify information silos (content that should be connected but isn't)
- Map content duplication patterns
- Analyze naming convention adherence
- Document organizational inconsistencies

**Deliverable**: Create `_VAULT_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md` with:
- Complete folder hierarchy with file counts
- Content type distribution analysis
- Redundancy report with specific examples
- Naming convention violations list
- Proposed restructuring plan with justification

## Phase 2: Link Integrity & Relationship Verification

### 2.1 Comprehensive Link Audit
**Task**: Verify every single internal link in the vault.

**Required Checks**:
```javascript
// Pseudocode for link verification
for each markdown file:
    extract all [[wiki links]]
    verify target exists
    check for case sensitivity issues
    detect near-matches (typos)
    identify orphaned pages (no incoming links)
    find broken link chains (A→B→C where B missing)
    detect circular references
```

**Special Attention**:
- Cross-campaign links (should they exist?)
- Links to archived content (should be updated)
- Links to templates (should be avoided in content)
- External links (verify they're still valid)

**Deliverable**: Create `_LINK_INTEGRITY_REPORT.md` with:
- Total links analyzed
- Broken links with specific file:line references
- Orphaned pages list
- Suggested link corrections
- Cross-reference matrix for major NPCs/Locations

### 2.2 Relationship Consistency
**Task**: Verify character and location relationships are bidirectional and consistent.

**Validation Rules**:
- If NPC A lists NPC B as ally, B should reference A
- If Location X contains NPC Y, Y's location should be X
- If Quest involves NPC Z, Z should reference the quest
- Faction membership should be consistent across all references
- Timeline references should align across all mentions

**Deliverable**: Create `_RELATIONSHIP_VALIDATION.md` documenting all inconsistencies.

## Phase 3: Database Enhancement & Bases Plugin Optimization

### 3.1 Bases Plugin Deep Dive
**Task**: Research and implement advanced Bases plugin features.

**Research Requirements**:
1. Study official Bases documentation: https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Bases

- Create relational links between bases
- Implement filtered views for session prep
- Add statistical analysis views
- Create player-facing filtered views

**Deliverable**: Enhanced .base files with documentation in `_BASES_ENHANCEMENT_GUIDE.md`

### 3.2 Create Missing Databases
**Task**: Identify and create missing database needs.

**Potential Databases**:
- Faction relationship tracker
- Timeline/chronology database
- Loot/treasure tracker
- Random encounter database
- Rule modification tracker
- Player action consequence tracker

**Each database must include**:
- Source folder configuration
- Minimum 5 useful properties
- At least 3 different views

**Resources to Cross-Reference**:
- D&D 5e SRD: https://dnd.wizards.com/resources/systems-reference-document
- Monster Manual, DMG, PHB indices
- Verify page numbers are correct
- Ensure edition consistency (2014 vs 2024 rules)

**Deliverable**: Update `_5E_CONNECTIONS.md` with complete mappings.

### 4.2 Combat Balance Verification
