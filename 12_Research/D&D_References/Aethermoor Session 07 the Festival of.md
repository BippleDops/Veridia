## üé¨ Strong Start

The festival grounds pulse with violet energy. Thousands of citizens stand in concentric circles, their eyes glazed, crystal veins spreading across their skin. The party must navigate through the crowd as the bloodline carrier is increasingly pulled toward the center. Every step closer accelerates their transformation. Overhead, the sky cracks like glass, revealing glimpses of an underwater realm.

## üîç Secrets & Clues

1. The ritual can be partially redirected rather than stopped
2. Citizens in the outer rings can still be saved
3. The Queen's consciousness is strongest near her sister's artifacts
4. [[Vex Shadowthorn]] has been promised rulership of the new world
5. The entity needs willing participation from the bloodline
6. Festival decorations hide ancient protective wards
7. [[Captain Lyanna Brightshield]] has the Queen's true crown
8. The transformation can be reversed within the first hour
9. Breaking three anchor points destabilizes everything
10. [[The Crimson Sage]] prepared a contingency inside the bloodline carrier

## üé≠ Cliffhanger Ending

As the bloodline carrier makes their choice, the ritual reaches critical mass. The sky shatters completely, revealing [[Aquabyssos]] descending from above like an inverted city. Water doesn't fall - it hangs in massive spheres. The entity's true form begins manifesting: a colossal crystalline figure made of thousands of absorbed souls. [[The Crimson Sage]] appears, burning with silver fire: "Now! While the barriers are weak! We can rewrite reality itself, but someone must anchor the new world order. Someone must become the seal." The bloodline carrier feels their body beginning to resonate with all seven shards.
