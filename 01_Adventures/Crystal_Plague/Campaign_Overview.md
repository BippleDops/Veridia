### The Volunteer Dilemma

Desperate infected volunteer for dangerous experiments:

Crystallized victims contain valuable materials:
- **Harvest**: Fund research but desecrate dead
- **Preserve**: Respect dead but lack resources
- **Selective**: Volunteer donors only

### The Immune Child

Child has natural immunity in their blood:
- **Extract Aggressively**: Fast cure but harm child
- **Protect Completely**: No cure but child safe
- **Negotiate**: Limited extraction with consent
