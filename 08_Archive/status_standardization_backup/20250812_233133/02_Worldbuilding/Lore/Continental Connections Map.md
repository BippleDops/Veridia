# Continental Connections Map

*"Every current flows somewhere - follow the connections to see the whole."*

## Overview
The Continental Connections Map is a comprehensive cartographic representation showing the physical, magical, and political connections between different continental regions across both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. This map reveals how underwater current systems link to surface geography, creating a unified view of inter-realm geography that traditional single-realm maps cannot provide.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
- Extensive geographical surveys of both realms
- Magical mapping techniques for dimensional connections
- Current flow analysis and surface topography correlation
- Political boundary documentation across realms

### Effects
- **Navigation Aid**: Improved travel planning between realms
- **Strategic Planning**: Military and diplomatic applications
- **Trade Route Optimization**: Enhanced commercial connections
- **Exploration Guidance**: Identifies unexplored connection points

### Duration
Requires regular updates as political boundaries and magical phenomena change.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Map Update**: Survey expedition to chart new connections
2. **Hidden Route**: Discovery of secret connection not on official maps
3. **Cartographic Espionage**: Steal or protect classified map sections

## Campaign Use
Provides visual aid for world-building and serves as reference for planning inter-realm travel and adventures.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
