### Light Domain (Level 3)

*Bring Light to Banish Darkness*

The Light Domain emphasizes the divine power to bring about blazing fire and revelation. Clerics who wield this power are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their deities' discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.

The Light Domain is associated with gods of truth, vigilance, beauty, insight, and renewal. Some of these gods are identified with the sun or as charioteers who guide the sun across the sky. Others are sentinels who pierce deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul's improvement.

### Light Domain Spells (Level 3)

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Light Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

**Light Domain Spells**

| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells |
|--------------|-----------------|
| 3rd | [[burning hands xphb|Burning Hands]], [[faerie fire xphb|Faerie Fire]], [[scorching ray xphb|Scorching Ray]], [[see invisibility xphb|See Invisibility]] |
| 5th | [[daylight xphb|Daylight]], [[fireball xphb|Fireball]] |
| 7th | [[arcane eye xphb|Arcane Eye]], [[wall of fire xphb|Wall of Fire]] |

### Radiance of the Dawn (Level 3)

As a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you present your [[holy symbol xphb|Holy Symbol]] and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to emit a flash of light in a 30-foot [[emanation area of effect xphb|Emanation]] originating from yourself. Any magical [[darkness xphb|Darkness]]â€”such as that created by the [[darkness xphb|Darkness]] spellâ€”in that area is dispelled. Additionally, each creature of your choice in that area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking Radiant damage equal to `2d10` plus your Cleric level on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Warding Flare (Level 3)

When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of yourself makes an attack roll, you can take a [[reaction xphb|Reaction]] to impose [[disadvantage xphb|Disadvantage]] on the attack roll, causing light to flare before it hits or misses.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long rest xphb|Long Rest]].

### Improved Warding Flare (Level 6)

You regain all expended uses of your Warding Flare when you finish a [[short rest xphb|Short]] or [[long rest xphb|Long Rest]].

In addition, whenever you use Warding Flare, you can give the target of the triggering attack a number of [[temporary hit points xphb|Temporary Hit Points]] equal to `2d6` plus your Wisdom modifier.

### Corona of Light (Level 17)

As a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you cause yourself to emit an aura of sunlight that lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required). You emit [[bright light xphb|Bright Light]] in a 60-foot radius and [[dim light xphb|Dim Light]] for an additional 30 feet. Your enemies in the [[bright light xphb|Bright Light]] have [[disadvantage xphb|Disadvantage]] on saving throws against your Radiance of the Dawn and any spell that deals Fire or Radiant damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long rest xphb|Long Rest]].
