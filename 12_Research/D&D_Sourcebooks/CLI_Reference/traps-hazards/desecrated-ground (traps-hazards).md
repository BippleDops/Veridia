--- # Desecrated Ground

*Wilderness Hazard* Some cemeteries and catacombs are imbued with the unseen traces of ancient evil. An area of desecrated ground can be any size, and a [[detect-evil-and-good-xphb (spells)]] spell cast within range reveals its presence. Undead standing on desecrated ground have advantage on all saving throws. A vial of [[Holy Water Xphb]] purifies a 10-foot-square area of desecrated ground when sprinkled on it, and a [[Hallow Xphb]] spell purifies desecrated ground within its area. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 110* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Desecrated ground is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of desecrated ground as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around desecrated ground. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Covenant - Control trade routes
