**Summary**: Personal Accounts **Diary of Marina Saltwind, Dock Worker's Daughter (45 PD)** - Key information at a glance.

*"Father says the shadows in the deep water are getting darker. Yesterday, Captain Torres came back from the Midnight Run with half his crew missing. They wouldn't say what happened down there, just kept muttering about 'the Mother's children.' I'm scared, but Father says I must be brave. The crystals will protect us, he says. But even the crystals are changing color now..."* **Letter from Scholar Erasmus Brightwater to his Sister (234 PD)**
*"Dearest Coral, The research proceeds, but I fear we are too late. The dimensional mathematics indicate a convergence event within the next two centuries. The Chancellor refuses to believe our calculations. He calls us 'doomsayers' and 'mad prophets.' But I have seen the void tears with my own eyes, and they hunger. If you receive this letter, take the children to the Highland Settlements. The coast will not be safe much longer..."* **Captain's Log - Admiral Elena Stormbreak (987 PD)**
*"Day 47 of the Great Harbor Emergency. We've rescued another 200 souls from the reality distortions near Pier 19. The evacuees describe their neighborhoods 'folding inward' and 'becoming liquid.' Three of my officers have reported seeing their own shadows moving independently. I've ordered all personnel to avoid reflective surfaces. The situation deteriorates hourly."* **Final Testament of Chancellor Nerida Brightwater (156 PD)**
*"To whoever may find this record in the dark days to come: We have failed to prevent the convergence, but we have not failed to remember. In the Sunken Archives beneath the Parliament building, you will find the collected wisdom of forty-seven generations. The Reality Anchors may hold, or they may not. But knowledge, once recorded, becomes eternal. The depths keep all secrets, and the depths remember all names."* ### The Golden Tide Currency

**Standard Denominations (Pre-987 PD)**
- Tidal Crown (1,000 units) - Reserved for major trade transactions
- Wave Sovereign (100 units) - Common merchant currency - Current Piece (10 units) - Standard worker wages
- Droplet (1 unit) - Small purchases and tips **Crystal-Enhanced Commerce**

Merchants used resoce crystals to verify currency authenticity and facilitate instant transfers across vast distances. The crystal network also enabled real-time market price updates across the empire. **Economic Collapse Sequence (634-298 PD)**
1. Crystal corruption rendered authentication systems unreliable
2. Counterfeit currency flooded the markets
3. Inter-city trade grinding to a halt due to verification failures
4. Local communities reverted to barter systems
5. Rise of "shadow currencies" backed by criminal organizations ### Trade Routes and Commerce **The Northern Circuit (2187-634 PD)**

The Royal Academy's Department of Theoretical Impossibilities made groundbreaking discoveries about the nature of reality itself: **Major Findings (1756-234 PD)**:
- Reality consists of "layered dimensions" that occasionally intersect
- Certain locations act as "anchor points" between dimensional layers
- Massive concentrations of consciousness can affect dimensional stability
- The mer-folk civilizations exist partially in adjacent dimensional space
- Crystal technology may inadvertently weaken dimensional barriers **Final Report by Professor Arcturus Voidwalker (234 PD)**:

*"Our research indicates that our civilization's expansion into the deep ocean has created unprecedented stress on the dimensional fabric. The mer-folk have warned us for centuries that their realm and ours are not meant to occupy the same space simultaneously. We now understand that The Drowning is not a natural disaster—it is a cosmic course correction. Two realities are becoming one, and both will be forever changed."* ### The Deep Fleet Organization **Command Structure (Final Era 156-1 PD)**

- **Admiral of the Depths**: Elena Stormbreak
- **Vice Admiral of Reconnaissance**: Cordelia Tidecaller - **Rear Admiral of Emergency Operations**: Marcus Brightwater
- **Fleet Captains**: 47 vessels ranging from scouts to deep-siege dreadnoughts **Ship Classifications**
- **Leviathan-class Dreadnoughts**: 12 vessels, designed for deep-trench warfare
- **Kraken-class Cruisers**: 34 vessels, multi-role deep patrol ships
- **Manta-class Scouts**: 156 vessels, rapid reconnaissance and communication
- **Nautilus-class Transports**: 89 vessels, civilian evacuation and supply **Final Naval Battle: The Deep Guard's Last Stand (12 PD)**

Location: The Convergence Point (later known as the Heart of Aquabyssos)

Participants: Combined fleet of 127 vessels vs. "entities from the deep void"

Outcome: Strategic victory enabling civilian evacuation, tactical annihilation of the fleet

Survivors: 3 vessels, 47 crew members total

Captain Torres Brightwater's final log: *"We have held the line long enough. The evacuation ships have reached the Reality Anchors. If anyone finds this record, know that we chose the depths willingly."* ### The Reality Guards **Formation and Training (1156-1 PD)**

Established as an elite force to combat dimensional intrusions, the Reality Guards underwent specialized training in:
- Recognition of dimensional anomalies
- Combat techniques against shadow entities - Emergency reality stabilization procedures
- Civilian protection during reality "storms" **Notable Operations**
- **Operation Deepwatch (987 PD)**: Successful evacuation of 12,000 civilians during the Great Harbor Emergency
- **The Shadow Purge (756 PD)**: Coordinated strikes against shadow infiltration cells
- **The Crystal Quarantine (634 PD)**: Failed attempt to contain the crystal plague outbreak
- **The Final Vigil (23-1 PD)**: Holding action to protect Parliament during The Drowning **Ceremonial Oath of the Reality Guards**:

*"We stand between the what-is and the what-might-be. We guard the boundaries of the possible. When reality breaks, we hold the pieces together. When the depths call, we answer with steel and crystal. Our names may be forgotten, but our watch shall never end."* ### The Great Recording Project (156-23 PD) In the final century before The Drowning, scholars and artists collaborated on the most ambitious cultural preservation effort in recorded history: **Archive Categories**:

- **Historical Scrolls**: Complete records of governmental proceedings, military campaigns, and diplomatic correspondence
- **Cultural Codex**: Music, art, literature, and performance traditions preserved in crystal memory matrices
- **Technical Manuals**: Engineering specifications, scientific formulae, and craft techniques
- **Personal Testimonies**: Thousands of individual accounts of daily life, hopes, fears, and dreams
- **Prophetic Visions**: Records of those who claimed foreknowledge of The Drowning **Storage Locations**:
- Primary Archive: The Sunken Library beneath Parliament (pressure-sealed, still accessible)
- Secondary Archive: Crystal Caverns of the Eastern Highlands (status unknown)
- Tertiary Archive: Mer-folk City of Deep Resoce (confirmed intact)
- Emergency Cache: Dimensional Anchor Station Seven (recently discovered) ### Language Evolution **Classical Aquatic** (2847-1289 PD)

Formal court language with influences from seven mainland kingdoms. Characterized by flowing syllables mimicking tidal movements. Still used for ceremonial occasions. **Parliamentary Common** (1289-634 PD) Simplified version developed for democratic goverce. Incorporated mer-folk linguistic elements and crystal resoce terminology. **Crisis Pidgin** (634-1 PD)

Hybrid language combining surface common, mer-folk dialects, and emergency communication codes. Formed the basis for post-Drowning Aquabyssos Common. ## Player-Facing Summary Pre Drowning Civilization Archives is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
