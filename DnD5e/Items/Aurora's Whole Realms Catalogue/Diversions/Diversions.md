# Diversions
## Overview
Occasionally stout-hearted adventurers need to unwind and enjoy themselves in amusements and diversions which do not risk life and limb. So too the children of older adventurers need their own entertainment when mother and father are out smiting evil. For this reason we’ve included a section of toys for the younger set and [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Diversions/Games/Games|games]] for Aurora’s more mature customers who remain young at heart. Drawing from the rich cultural traditions of the Heartlands and the wonders beyond, I have assembled a selection of toys for the children and [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Diversions/Games/Games|games]] for the adults. All amusements are durable and elegant in their design, crafted by the finest artisans in the country of the toy or game’s origin. Most can be packed away in a [[Rucksack|rucksack]] and brought out for fireside amusement while on adventure or during that long winter’s respite from the adventuring life. While I have separated these diversions into two separate categories, there is no rule to say that a child would not find wonderful entertainment in the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Diversions/Games/Games|games]] section, or that an adult would not be delighted by a selection from the toy department. Enjoy!
