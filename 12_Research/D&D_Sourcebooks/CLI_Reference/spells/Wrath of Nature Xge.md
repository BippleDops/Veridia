## Grasses and Undergrowth

Any area of ground in the cube that is covered by grass or undergrowth is difficult terrain for your enemies.

## Trees

At the start of each of your turns, each of your enemies within 10 feet of any tree in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `4d6` slashing damage from whipping branches.

## Roots and Vines

At the end of each of your turns, one creature of your choice that is on the ground in the cube must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become [[conditions#Restrained|restrained]] until the spell ends. A [[conditions#Restrained|restrained]] creature can use an action to make a Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Rocks

As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause a loose rock in the cube to launch at a creature you can see in the cube. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `3d8` nonmagical bludgeoning damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall [[conditions#prone|prone]].
