As long as the sword is attuned to you and you are holding it in your hand, you can cast [detect-magic-xphb (spells)]] (1 charge), [[detect-evil-and-good-xphb (spells) (1 charge), or [detect-thoughts-xphb (spells)]] (2 charges). Each night at midnight, Hazirawn regains`d4`expended charges. ## Wounding While you are attuned to the weapon, any creature that you hit with Hazirawn can't regain hit points for 1 minute. The target can make a **DC 15** Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect early on a success. *Source: Hoard of the Dragon Queen p. 94* ## Player-Facing Summary Hazirawn hotdq is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.

Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around hazirawn hotdq. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Alliance - Achieve immortality ## Plot Hooks - Strange accidents suggest a curse
