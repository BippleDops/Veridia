## Description
For many of the established and churchly faiths of Toril, altars (when sanctified) act as powerful tools for priests. When setting off on adventures, however, clerics must commonly leave this tool behind.

In response to this dilemma, I have commissioned artisans of fine wood and stone to create altar casesâ€”narrow [[Boxes|boxes]] that open up to form traveling altars. Within each box is room for small holy [[Implements|implements]] and vessels, an altar cloth, and a compact prayer book. By blessing these [[Boxes|boxes]] and properly provisioning them, priests can take their temple with them. Spruce: 15 gp; Granite: 40 gp.

## Additional Details
