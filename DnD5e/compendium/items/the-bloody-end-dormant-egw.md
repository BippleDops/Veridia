Carrying the power of Bane, this adamantine morningstar sports foot-long spikes and has a jagged blade on its pommel.

## Sentience

The Bloody End is a sentient lawful evil weapon with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 18, and a Charisma of 24. It has hearing and [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common and Infernal.

## Personality

A tyrannical [pit fiend](/compendium/bestiary/fiend/pit-fiend.md) named Izeelzee lives within The Bloody End. The weapon boisterously pushes its wielder to subjugate others and to never back down from a challenge. If the wielder doesn't demand fealty from others, the weapon is happy to demand it on their behalf.

## Dormant

The morningstar grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- You can speak, read, and write Infernal.
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
- While holding the morningstar, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 13): [charm person](/compendium/spells/charm-person.md), [dominate person](/compendium/spells/dominate-person.md), or [fear](/compendium/spells/fear.md). Once a spell has been cast using the morningstar, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.
- While holding the morningstar, you have advantage on Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) checks.
