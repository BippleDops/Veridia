# Cover
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 364. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

Cover provides a degree of protection to a target behind it. There are three degrees of cover, each of which provides a different benefit to a target: Half Cover (+2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws), Three-Quarters Cover (+5 bonus to AC and Dexterity [saving throws](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/saving-throw-xphb.md)), and Total Cover (can't be targeted directly). If behind more than one degree of cover, a target benefits only from the most protective degree.
