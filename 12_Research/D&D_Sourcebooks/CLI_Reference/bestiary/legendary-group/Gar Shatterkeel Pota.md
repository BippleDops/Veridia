# Gar Shatterkeel

## Lair actions
_Source: Princes of the Apocalypse_

If Gar is in the water node while [[olhydra-pota|Olhydra]] isn't, he can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Gar uses a lair action to use his Multiattack or cast one of his spells, up to 3rd level, without using components or a spell slot. He can't cast the same spell two rounds in a row, but he can continue to concentrate on a spell he previously cast using a lair action. He can take no other lair actions while [[conditions#Concentration|concentrating]] on a spell cast as a lair action. His favorite use of this capability is casting [[inflict-wounds-xphb|inflict wounds]] or [[call-lightning-xphb|call lightning]].

If Gar casts [[cure-wounds-xphb|cure wounds]] using this lair action, he regains the maximum number of hit points from the spell (28).
