## Special Traits
***Spellcasting.*** The naga is a 5th-level spellcaster (spell save DC 12, +4 to hit with spell attacks) that needs only verbal components to cast its spells. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom, and it has the following cleric spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): *mending, sacred flame, thaumaturgy*
1st level (4 slots): *command, shield of faith*
2nd level (3 slots): *calm emotions, hold person*
3rd level (2 slots): *bestow curse*

## Actions
***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (`dice: 2d6+3`) piercing damage plus 10 (`dice: 3d6`) poison damage.

## Description
In response to the long history of conflict between the yuan-ti and the nagas, yuan-ti created a necromantic ritual that could halt a naga's resurrection by transforming the living naga into a skeletal undead servitor. A bone naga retains only a few of the spells it knew in life.
