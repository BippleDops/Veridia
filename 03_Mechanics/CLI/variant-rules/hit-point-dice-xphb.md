# Hit Point Dice
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 368. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

Hit Point Dice, or Hit Dice for short, help determine a [player character's](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/player-character-xphb.md) Hit Point maximum, as explained in "chapter 2". Most [monsters](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/monster-xphb.md) also have Hit Dice. A creature can spend Hit Dice during a [Short Rest](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb.md) to regain [Hit Points](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md).
