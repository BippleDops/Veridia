## Overview
Naia was born from the intersection of shadow and song, manifesting when a grieving mother's lament resonated with the [[The Deep Mother|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]]'s own sorrow at the world's pain. She embodies the Deep Mother's sadness made manifest, leading [[The Sorrow Singers]] in their sacred duty to give voice to all the grief, loss, and melancholy that the sleeping goddess feels for her suffering children. Her songs can heal emotional wounds or drive listeners to despair.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **The Silent Grief**: Help her reach community too traumatized to express their pain
2. **The Lost Song**: Recover ancient song needed for Deep Mother's comfort
3. **The Healing Concert**: Protect her performance from those who profit from despair
4. **The Shadow Chorus**: Investigate why shadow creatures are mimicking her songs
5. **The Final Lament**: Help prepare for or prevent the Great Lamentation

### Special Abilities

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Naia fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Deep Mother's Conduit.** Naia has a direct connection to [[The Deep Mother|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]]. She can sense the emotional state of any creature within 1 mile and knows instinctively how to ease their suffering.

**Shadow Integration.** Shadows cling to Naia like living silk. As a bonus action, she can become incorporeal until the start of her next turn, allowing her to move through objects and creatures.

**Empathic Resoce.** When Naia uses her voice abilities, all creatures within range must make a Charisma saving throw or be affected by her intended emotion. The DC varies by ability used.

**Sorrow Singer Magic.** Naia is an 18th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 21, +13 to hit with spell attacks). She knows the following spells:

- **Cantrips (at will):** minor illusion, prestidigitation, thaumaturgy, vicious mockery
- **1st level (4 slots):** charm person, cure wounds, healing word, sanctuary
- **2nd level (3 slots):** calm emotions, hold person, suggestion, zone of truth
- **3rd level (3 slots):** catnap, counterspell, hypnotic pattern, sending
- **4th level (3 slots):** confusion, dominate beast, hallucinatory terrain
- **5th level (3 slots):** dominate person, dream, geas, greater restoration
- **6th level (1 slot):** heal, mass suggestion, otto's irresistible dance
- **7th level (1 slot):** plane shift, regenerate
- **8th level (1 slot):** dominate monster, feeblemind
- **9th level (1 slot):** mass heal, psychic lance

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Naia makes two Song of Sorrow attacks or casts a spell and makes one Song attack.

**Song of Crushing Sorrow.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +13 to hit, range 120 ft., up to 3 targets. *Hit:* Each target must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or take 22 (4d6 + 8) psychic damage and be incapacitated by overwhelming sadness until the end of their next turn. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not incapacitated.

**Healing Harmony (3/Day).** Naia sings a therapeutic melody. All allies within 60 feet regain 45 (10d8) hit points and are cured of one condition of their choice (charmed, frightened, stunned, or poisoned). Additionally, they gain temporary hit points equal to her Charisma modifier.

**Shadow Chorus (1/Day).** Naia summons echoes of past [[The Sorrow Singers]] to join her voice. For 1 minute, all of her voice-based abilities affect twice as many targets and have their save DCs increased by 2. The shadowy forms of ancient singers appear around her, providing three-quarters cover.

**Memory Melody (Recharge 5-6).** Naia sings a song that helps listeners remember lost loved ones. All creatures within 60 feet must make a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they become overwhelmed with memories and are stunned for 1 round but gain advantage on their next attack or ability check as the memories inspire them. Undead in the area take 27 (6d8) radiant damage instead.

**The Great Lament (1/Day).** Naia channels the [[The Deep Mother|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]]'s cosmic sadness. All creatures within 120 feet must make a DC 21 Charisma saving throw. Enemies that fail take 36 (8d8) psychic damage and are frightened for 1 minute. Allies that fail are filled with profound empathy and gain resistance to all damage for 1 minute. All creatures feel the weight of universal suffering.

### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)
Naia can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.

**Move.** Naia moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks, potentially becoming incorporeal.

**Song Fragment.** Naia makes one Song of Crushing Sorrow attack.

**Empathic Touch.** Naia touches a creature within 5 feet. If willing, they regain 11 (2d4 + 6) hit points. If unwilling, they must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of their next turn as overwhelming emotion floods through them.

**Therapeutic Whisper (Costs 2 Actions).** Naia casts a spell of 3rd level or lower, or uses Healing Harmony if available.

### Lair Actions
When encountered at the [[Shadow Wells]] or another site sacred to [[The Sorrow Singers]], Naia can take lair actions on initiative count 20:

**Echoing Chamber.** The walls echo with ghostly voices of past singers. All creatures in the lair must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by Naia until initiative count 20 of the next round.

**Shadow Sanctuary.** Shadows in the lair become protective. All allies gain half cover from ranged attacks, and enemies have disadvantage on attack rolls against Naia.

**Deep Mother's Presence.** The emotional weight of the [[The Deep Mother|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]]'s attention fills the space. All creatures must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw or be overwhelmed by empathy, becoming unable to attack creatures with lower hit points than themselves until initiative count 20 of the next round.

#### The Song of Convergence
*"Seven lights shall bleed their pain into the world's deep well, and when the Mother stirs, all sorrow becomes one song. The child of gold holds the key to harmony, but only if the shadows learn to sing of hope instead of loss."*

#### The Lament of Awakening  
*"When divinity fragments, mortal hearts must hold the pieces. Each bearer carries not just power, but the god's experience of what it means to love, to lose, to hope, to despair. The reunion is not of powerâ€”it is of understanding."*

#### The Healing Truth
*"The Deep Mother's sorrow is not endless sadness, but endless compassion. She weeps not for her own pain, but for every child who suffers. Her awakening depends not on power gathered, but on whether her children have learned to heal each other's wounds."*

#### Current Visions
Naia's connection to the [[The Deep Mother|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]] grants her prophetic dreams:
- Visions of [[Gareth Goldenheart, The Chosen Vessel]] surrounded by golden light, singing with a voice that could heal or shatter worlds
- Dreams of all Seven Shard bearers standing in a circle, their combined light either creating or destroying everything
- Glimpses of the [[The Deep Mother|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]] rising from her depths, her expression either infinite love or cosmic rage depending on her children's choices
- Scenes of [[Aethermoor|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos]] merging at the [[Convergence Point|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/Convergence Point]], with emotions becoming visible as flowing light

#### Emotional Preparation
*"Those who would seek the Shards must first understand the weight of godhood. I can show you what it means to carry divine sorrow, divine joy, divine responsibility. Many who pass my tests realize they do not truly want what they seek."*

#### Shard Bearer Counseling  
*"The fragments call to each other, but they also call to those who understand their nature. I can help you resist the corruption, find balance between mortal and divine, and remember your humanity even as power transforms you."*
