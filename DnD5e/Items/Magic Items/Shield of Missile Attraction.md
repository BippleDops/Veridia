## Description
While holding this [[Shield|shield]], you have [[17 - Damage and Healing|resistance]] to damage from ranged weapon attacks.

***Curse.*** This [[Shield|shield]] is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the **[[Remove Curse|remove curse]]** spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.
