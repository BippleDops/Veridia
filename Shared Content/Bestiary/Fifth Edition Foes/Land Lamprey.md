## Actions
**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (`dice: 1d4+2`) piercing damage and the lamprey enters the target's space and attaches itself to the target. While attached, the lamprey doesn't attack but automatically inflicts 4 (`dice: 1d4+2`) piercing damage at the start of its turn. The lamprey can't move on its own while attached, but it moves with the other creature. To get free from the lamprey, the target creature uses its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the lamprey's Dexterity check. The lamprey has tactical advantage on this check. It can't use its bite attack again until it is pulled free or it releases the target, either of which automatically moves it out of that creature's space. A lamprey detaches immediately if it caused 5 or 6 damage that turn.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate land or underground

**Organization**: Solitary, pack (2–5), or swarm (6–11)
