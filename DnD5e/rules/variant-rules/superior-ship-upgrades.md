# Superior Ship Upgrades
*Source: Ghosts of Saltmarsh p. 196* 

## Superior Ship Upgrades

Some vessels possess extraordinary abilities, whether due to magic or superior artisanship. The upgrades below can replace a ship's existing components or provide a new element to augment a ship's abilities.

Adding an upgrade costs 15,000 gp and requires 1d4 weeks of work. During that time, the ship must remain in port. If the ship leaves, the work must start over, but you don't need to pay the gold piece cost a second time.

### Hull Upgrades

Any ship with a hull can gain one of the following upgrades. In some cases, an upgrade also provides a benefit to the ship's other components.

- {@vehupgrade Churning Hull|GoS}
- {@vehupgrade Death Vessel|GoS}
- {@vehupgrade Frost-Locked Hull|GoS}
- {@vehupgrade Living Vessel|GoS}
- {@vehupgrade Reinforced Hull|GoS}
- {@vehupgrade Vigilant Watch|GoS}

### Movement Upgrades

Each movement upgrade applies to a specific movement type. A component can gain the benefits of one upgrade.

- {@vehupgrade Clockwork Oars|GoS}
- {@vehupgrade Ever-Full Sails|GoS}
- {@vehupgrade Defiant Sails|GoS}
- {@vehupgrade Dragon Sails|GoS}
- {@vehupgrade Screaming Sails|GoS}
- {@vehupgrade Scything Oars|GoS}

### Weapon Upgrades

The following upgrades can apply to any weapon mounted aboard a ship. A component can gain the benefits of one upgrade, or two upgrades if one of the upgrades is {@vehupgrade Arcane Artillery|GoS}.

- {@vehupgrade Arcane Artillery|GoS}
- {@vehupgrade Concussive Rounds|GoS}
- {@vehupgrade Explosive Rounds|GoS}
- {@vehupgrade Grasping Rounds|GoS}

### Figurehead Upgrades

While figureheads are usually purely decorative, they might be magically treated to produce extraordinary effects. A ship can receive one figurehead upgrade.

- {@vehupgrade Guardian Figurehead|GoS}
- {@vehupgrade Red Dragon Figurehead|GoS}
- {@vehupgrade Storm Giant Figurehead|GoS}

### Miscellaneous Upgrades

The following upgrades don't apply to a specific element of the ship. A ship can use any number of them, but it can gain a specific upgrade only once.

- {@vehupgrade Bones of Endless Toil|GoS}
- {@vehupgrade Smuggler's Banner|GoS}
- {@vehupgrade Taskmaster's Drums|GoS}
