## Description

This dark spider-silk cloak is made by [[drow]] . It is a [[cloak of elvenkind]]. It loses its magic if exposed to sunlight for 1 hour without interruption.

While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks made to see you have disadvantage. and you have advantage on Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks made to hide, as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
