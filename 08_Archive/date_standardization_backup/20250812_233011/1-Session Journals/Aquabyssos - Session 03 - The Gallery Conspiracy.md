# Session 03: The Gallery Conspiracy
## The Parliament of Shadows - Act 1

## Session Summary
The party awakens to find one member replaced by their reflection from an alternate timeline. As they investigate the Gallery of Frozen Waves, they uncover a massive shadow surgery operation preparing for a harvest at high tide. The Conductor's screaming symphony reveals warnings from drowning victims while memory farmers profit from stolen identities.

## Pre-Session Planning

### Key Objectives
- [ ] Create identity paranoia with reflection replacement
- [ ] Reveal scope of shadow surgery operation
- [ ] Introduce memory as commodity
- [ ] Build to high tide deadline
- [ ] Rescue real Senator Glaucus

### Required Props
- Mirror shard props for identity testing
- Screaming Gardens sound effects
- Memory kelp descriptions (index cards)
- Temporal wave movement tracker
- Surgical schedule handout

## Strong Start
> *Read aloud:* "You wake to arguing. Two identical versions of [PARTY MEMBER] stand in your quarters, each insisting they're real. Both have complete memories. Both bleed red blood. Both cast shadowsâ€”shadows that move independently, watching this identity crisis with what might be amusement. Through the window, the Screaming Gardens harmonize into actual words: 'The surgeons come at high tide.' You have six hours."

### Identity Crisis Resolution
**Tests to Determine Reality**:
- Shared memory only original would know (Insight DC 16)
- Shadow behavior differences (Perception DC 14)
- Reflection doesn't know about shadow conspiracy details
- Marina can "taste" the difference if present
- Memory from yesterday's temporal overlap

### Immediate Decisions
- Keep both versions?
- Investigate the warning?
- Report to Parliament?
- Search for more replacements?

## Scene 1: The Reflection Crisis

### Location: [[Party Quarters - Inverse Palace]]
**Atmosphere**: Morning light through water creates caustic patterns. Both versions of party member perfect except for subtle differences.

### The Reflection's Nature
- From timeline where party sided with shadows
- Has memories of different choices made
- Genuinely believes they're original
- If killed, original feels the death
- Can provide information about alternate timeline

### Reflection Broker's Mark
**Investigation DC 15 reveals**:
- Microscopic symbol on reflection's neck
- Trademark of Reflection Broker Mirrors
- Indicates "premium replacement"
- Can be tracked to source

### Shadow Reactions
Both versions' shadows:
- Watch with interest
- Occasionally swap places
- Seem to be communicating
- One shadow knows the truth

### Resolution Options
1. **Merge Them**: Risky ritual combining both
2. **Banish Reflection**: Returns to timeline but creates enemy
3. **Keep Both**: Complications but double resources
4. **Switch Places**: Send original to other timeline

## Scene 2: The Conductor's Symphony

### Location: [[Screaming Gardens - Songwood Grove]]
**Atmosphere**: Crystallized trees made from screams, each one a drowning victim's last moment preserved forever.

### The Conductor
**Appearance**: Humanoid form of crystallized sound, constantly vibrating
**Communication**: Speaks in musical harmonies
**Knowledge**: Every scream tells a story
**Warning**: "The shadows prepare a grand performance"

### The Screaming Symphony
**Performance Check DC 14 to understand**:
- Children's screams: "Shadow in the water"
- Sailors' screams: "They wear our faces"
- Nobles' screams: "The harvest comes with tide"
- Ancient screams: "Seven times before, seven times again"

### Environmental Challenge
**Prolonged Exposure** (Every 10 minutes):
- CON save DC 13 or deafened for 1 hour
- WIS save DC 15 or short-term madness
- After 3 failures: Permanent sensitivity to sound

### The Grove's Secret
**Hidden among the trees**:
- Senator Glaucus's wife, crystallized mid-scream
- Still partially conscious
- Screams the location of her husband
- Can be freed but dies immediately

### Navigating the Gardens
**Skill Challenge - 4 successes before 3 failures**:
- Performance DC 15: Harmonize with screams for safe passage
- Constitution DC 14: Endure the acoustic assault
- Investigation DC 16: Decode scream patterns for information
- Failure: Attract Screaming Tree Guardians

## Scene 3: The Gallery Investigation

### Location: [[Gallery of Frozen Waves]]
**Atmosphere**: Tsunami waves frozen mid-crash, each one a different temporal moment. Time moves differently in each wave.

### Temporal Wave Navigation
**Each wave has different time flow**:
- Wave 1: Time moves backward (see yesterday)
- Wave 2: Time moves forward (see tomorrow)
- Wave 3: Time stops (frozen moment)
- Wave 4: Time accelerates (age rapidly)
- Wave 5: Time loops (repeat 5 minutes)

### DEX Save DC 14 to move between waves
**Failure results**:
- Age 1d10 years or regress 1d10 years
- Stuck in time loop for 10 minutes
- See your own death (WIS save DC 16 or frightened)

### Tomorrow's Wave Discovery
**In the forward-time wave**:
- Witness tomorrow's shadow surgery
- See party members being operated on
- Shadow Duchess Nyx overseeing
- Mass replacement of Parliament occurring

### Yesterday's Wave Evidence
**In the backward-time wave**:
- Senator bodies being stored
- Shadows practicing wearing skins
- Reflection Broker making deals
- Map to surgery preparation site

### The Frozen Moment
**In the stopped-time wave**:
- Can interact with frozen scene
- Senator Glaucus mid-kidnapping
- Identify his captors (memory farmers)
- Steal shadow surgeon tools

## Scene 4: The Memory Farm Raid

### Location: [[Memory Meadows Black Market]]
**Atmosphere**: Fields of kelp storing stolen memories, each strand a life's worth of experiences.

### Memory Farmer Thane
**Appearance**: Eyes clouded with too many memories
**Business**: Selling memories to shadows for coherency
**Defense**: Uses stolen memories as weapons
**Secret**: Has original Senator Glaucus in basement

### The Memory Kelp Fields
**Touching kelp without protection**:
- WIS save DC 15 or lose random memory
- Gain random NPC memory
- Risk identity confusion (disadvantage on WIS saves)

### Memory Combat Mechanics
**Farmers fight using memories**:
- Traumatic Memory Blast: 2d6 psychic damage
- Happy Memory Shield: +3 AS as reaction
- Confusion Cloud: Targets forget why they're fighting
- Identity Theft: Swap memories between combatants

### Rescuing Senator Glaucus
**Location**: Hidden basement, memory-proofed
**Condition**: Drained but alive
**Information**: Has been replaced for three weeks
**Proof**: Shadow Duchess orchestrating everything
**Warning**: "At high tide, every shadow in the city replaces their original"

### Thane's Records
**Investigation DC 16 finds**:
- Client list (all shadows)
- Memory catalog (blackmail material)
- Schedule of "harvests"
- Payment records from Tenebrarum

## Cliffhanger Ending

### High Tide Approaches
> *Read aloud:* "Senator Glaucus gasps as you help him to safety: 'The Shadow Duchessâ€”she's not investigating the conspiracy, she IS the conspiracy! No, waitâ€”' His face contorts in pain. 'That's wrong. She's investigating her own shadow. The real Duchess has been fighting her shadow for years.'
> 
> Through the windows, you see the tide beginning to riseâ€”impossibly, as tides don't exist at this depth. Every shadow in the city stops what it's doing and turns toward the Reflection Pools. They begin walking in perfect synchronization.
> 
> Marina's shadow separates from her completely, speaking with her voice but wrong: 'The vote was unanimous. The harvest begins at high tide. You can join us willingly, or we take you anyway. One hour remains.'
> 
> Your own shadows pull away, standing at arm's length, waiting. In the distance, bells tollâ€”but the sound comes from below, not above."

### Immediate Consequences
- All shadows now independent for 1 hour
- Must maintain distance from own shadow
- City-wide panic as shadows mobilize
- High tide in exactly 1 hour
- Reflection Pools become active surgery sites
