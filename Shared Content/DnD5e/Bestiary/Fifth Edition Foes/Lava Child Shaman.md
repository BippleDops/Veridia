## Special Traits
**Elemental Vulnerability:** [[Lava Child|Lava children]] take 1 extra damage per damage die from spells of the tempest domain. They are unaffected (either directly or indirectly) by spells of the transmutation school.

**Metal Immunity:** [[Lava Child|Lava children]] are completely unaffected by metal. They can walk through metal doors or bars as if the metal wasn't there, and metal objects and weapons, including magic weapons, pass right through a [[Lava Child|lava child]]'s body without affecting it in any way. Because of this, a lava child also has tactical advantage on melee attack rolls against targets wearing armor that is predominantly metal.

**[[Lava Child|Lava Child]] Shaman:** Every band of [[Lava Child|lava children]] includes one arcane spellcaster. A lava child spellcaster has heightened Charisma (13) and the ability to cast the following spells, using Charisma as its spellcasting ability (DC 11, attack +3). It doesn’t need material components to cast these spells. The shaman is CR 1 (200 XP).

- Cantrips (at will): *fire bolt, dancing lights*

- 1st level (x4): *burning hands, comprehend languages, magic missile*

- 2nd level (x2): *continual flame, scorching ray*

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A [[Lava Child|lava child]] bites once and attacks once with claws.

**Claws:** *Melee Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d8+1`) slashing damage.

**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (`dice: 1d6+1`) bludgeoning damage. If the [[Lava Child|lava child]] bites the same creature that it hit with its claws this turn, its bite does an additional 4 (`dice: 1d8`) fire damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Underground

**Organization**: Gang (3–6) or band (7–14 plus 1 shaman and 1–8 noncombatants)
