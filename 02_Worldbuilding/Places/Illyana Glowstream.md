# Illyana Glowstream

*"Light is not merely illumination - it is hope made manifest, and in these dark times, hope is the most powerful magic of all."*

## Overview

Illyana Glowstream is Aquabyssos's premier light mage and illumination engineer, responsible for maintaining the complex network of magical and bioluminescent lighting systems that make life possible in the deep-sea city. Her expertise combines traditional wizardry with innovative bio-magical techniques, creating sustainable light sources that work harmoniously with the underwater environment.

As both a practitioner of light magic and a civic engineer, Illyana occupies a unique position in the city's hierarchy. Her work is essential to daily life, making her invaluable to all factions while her optimistic philosophy and dedication to illumination make her a symbol of hope during troubled times.

Beyond her technical duties, Illyana serves as an informal counselor and mediator, using her light magic not just to illuminate physical spaces but to brighten people's spirits and provide clarity during difficult decisions.

## Appearance

Illyana is a striking water genasi in her early thirties, with skin that shifts between deep blue and bright silver depending on the light around her. Her hair appears to be made of flowing water infused with tiny points of light, creating a constantly shifting aurora effect. Her eyes glow with a gentle golden light that intensifies when she's using her magical abilities.

She wears robes woven from bioluminescent fibers that pulse gently with her heartbeat, creating an aura of warmth and comfort around her. Her staff, carved from crystallized sea foam, serves as both a focus for her magic and a portable light source.

## Background

Illyana was born in a surface coastal city but drawn to the underwater realm by prophetic dreams about bringing light to the depths. She arrived in Aquabyssos twelve years ago as a young mage and quickly distinguished herself by solving critical problems with the city's aging illumination infrastructure.

Her innovative combination of traditional magic with bio-luminescent cultivation revolutionized how the city approaches lighting, creating sustainable systems that work with rather than against the natural underwater environment. Her work has been so successful that other underwater settlements regularly send delegations to learn her techniques.

## Current Activities

As political tensions rise, Illyana has noticed increased stress on the city's lighting systems - both from sabotage attempts and from the emotional darkness affecting the population. She's been working overtime to maintain illumination while secretly investigating who might be systematically targeting the city's infrastructure.

She's also been providing informal counseling services, using her light magic to help lift the depression and despair that's spreading throughout the city alongside the political unrest.

- **Clerics and Healers**: Collaborates on therapeutic applications of light magic

## Secrets

- Maintains emergency light sources that could illuminate the entire city if needed
- Her light magic allows her to see through illusions and deceptions
- Keeps detailed records of power fluctuations that could reveal patterns of faction activity
