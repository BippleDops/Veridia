# Trap #43 - "I Always Figgured Tomb Robbers Deserve A Good Trashing."
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> Upon exiting the "wall of spears" room the party will find themselves in a small corridor 10 feet wide and 20 feet long, with a ceiling 10 feet high. At the end is a blank wall. Beneath the stucco is a typical three finger hole door. Once the party has opened the door they will find a 30 by 30 foot room with the usual doorless walls. They are covered with stucco. The floor is divided into four square sections, of four different colors. The colors are irrelevant but in order to add to the partys confusion by feeding idle speculation, they are red, gold.green and blue. Once the party begins to enter the room keep track of the total weight of the characters. You don't want to be caught unawares when the 500 lb. limit is reached and the trap activates.
> 
> Once 500 lbs of tomb robber on the hoof enters the room the floor splits down the middle and dumps the entrants into the jaws of a giant bladed thrashing machine. The floor then slams back into place.
> 
> The thrasher is a truly inspired device. No dungeon should be without one. This beauty consists of two giant counterrotating axles studded with crude, rusty, iron blades. The whole mechanism is built 20 feet below the floor level. The blades are set to rotating by surprisingly noiseless water wheels fed from the underground river. The water is released into the trap by the opening of the doors. (If the party lays on the ground before entering they will hear the sound of rushing water, and .perhaps the rumble of the turning wheel, but seriously, when was the last time you saw a party of delvers do that?)
> 
> There is a 30% chance (L3) that heavy plate armor will jam the works, which will save all the others who fell in from death. Those more lightly armored will have a 30% chance of being injured by the fall into the blades, even if they are jammed. If the party has any "Indestructible" item, (A Delux Staff, The Sword of Incredible Hardness, or such like.) this will serve to jam the device as well.
> 
> Anything used to jam the thrasher will be lost. The blades cannot be pried apart with the pressure of the river pressing upon it. If the person inside the plate armor can demonstrate the ability to get out of the armor by wriggling about (About 40% (L4) will be able to manage this trick) he can get free. If that agile, he will be subject to the same damage as one of the lightly armored fellows when the thrasher jerks snug, crushing or twisting some now empty piece of armor.
> 
> Below the thrasher there is a wide assortment of chipped bones crushed armor, and battered odds and ends. There is also about 3,000 g.p. worth of loose change.
> 
> Once the mechanism that operates the floor sections has been understood, or jammed, the party can check out the walls for doors.
> 
> With armor this is only a one skull trap, but if there is no heavy armor present, it moves up to a 3 skuller.
