# Challenge Rating
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 363. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* 

Challenge Rating (CR) summarizes the threat a [[Charm Monster Xphb]] poses to a group of four [[Player Character Xphb]]. Compare a [[Charm Monster Xphb]] CR to the characters' level. If the CR is higher, the [[Charm Monster Xphb]] is likely a danger. If the CR is lower, the [[Charm Monster Xphb]] likely poses little threat. But circumstances and the number of [[Player Character Xphb]] can significantly alter how threatening a [[Charm Monster Xphb]] is in actual play. The "Dungeon Master's Guide" provides guidance to the DM on using CR while planning potential combat [[Encounter Xphb]].
