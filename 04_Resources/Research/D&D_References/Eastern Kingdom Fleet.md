*The Allied Naval Force from Beyond the Horizon* > *"When darkness threatened to swallow both sea and land, they came from distant shores with sails full of hope and hulls heavy with purpose. The Eastern Fleet reminds us that even in our darkest hour, we are not alone in this vast world."*

> â€” [[Admiral Storm Tidecaller, Aquabyssos Naval Command ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview The Eastern Kingdom Fleet represents a powerful naval force from distant lands beyond the immediate region of [Aquabyssos]] and [[Aethermoor, arriving during the crisis periods to provide crucial military and humanitarian support. This foreign fleet brings advanced naval technology, experienced crews, and resources that have proven essential for maintaining maritime security and supporting resistance efforts against various threats affecting both worlds. Originally dispatched as an exploratory and trade mission, the Eastern Kingdom Fleet found themselves thrust into a supporting role during the simultaneous crises affecting the region. Their decision to remain and provide assistance rather than withdrawing to safety has made them invaluable allies and demonstrated the broader international implications of the threats facing both [Aquabyssos]] and [[Aethermoor. The fleet operates under a joint command structure that coordinates with both local governments and the [United Councils of Both Worlds]], providing naval expertise, logistical support, and military capabilities that complement local forces. Their presence has been crucial for maintaining supply lines, conducting rescue operations, and providing security for maritime activities. Beyond their immediate military contributions, the Eastern Kingdom Fleet serves as a link to the wider world, bringing news of distant lands, alternative perspectives on local challenges, and proof that the struggles of [[Aquabyssos and [Aethermoor]] are not isolated events but part of larger patterns affecting multiple civilizations. ### Flagship and Command Vessels The Eastern Kingdom Fleet is led by the massive flagship *Horizon's Promise*, a multi-deck vessel combining advanced surface navigation with limited underwater capabilities. This ship serves as the fleet's command center and diplomatic headquarters, housing senior officers and specialized equipment for coordinating complex multi-environment operations. Command vessels include specialized ships designed for communication, intelligence gathering, and tactical coordination. These ships maintain constant contact with distant Eastern Kingdom territories while serving as mobile command posts for fleet operations in support of local allies. The fleet's capital ships provide heavy firepower and serve as platforms for large-scale operations, with magical enhancement systems that allow them to operate effectively in both normal maritime conditions and the magically altered environments common to the region. Support vessels in the command structure include diplomatic ships equipped for inter-realm communication, medical vessels providing advanced healing capabilities, and supply ships maintaining the fleet's operational independence while supporting local forces. ### Combat Vessels The Eastern Kingdom Fleet's combat vessels represent advanced naval warfare technology adapted for the unique challenges of operating in magically influenced waters. These ships combine traditional naval design with magical enhancements and specialized equipment for addressing supernatural threats. Destroyers and frigates provide fast response capabilities, equipped with both conventional weapons and magical systems designed for combating corrupted creatures, void-influenced entities, and other supernatural threats. These ships serve as the fleet's primary tactical response force. Heavy cruisers provide sustained firepower and serve as platforms for major offensive operations, with armor and magical shielding systems that allow them to operate in dangerous environments including crystal-corrupted areas and void-influenced waters. Specialized combat vessels include anti-corruption ships designed specifically for operating in magically contaminated areas, void-hunters equipped for tracking and engaging cosmic threats, and amphibious assault ships capable of supporting operations in both underwater and surface environments. ### Support and Auxiliary Vessels The fleet's extensive support structure enables sustained operations far from home ports while providing crucial assistance to local allied forces. These vessels represent a significant portion of the fleet's overall capability and have proven essential for maintaining effectiveness during extended deployment. Hospital ships provide advanced medical care using Eastern Kingdom healing techniques combined with local knowledge, creating treatment capabilities superior to what either tradition could achieve independently. These vessels have saved countless lives during major crisis events.
