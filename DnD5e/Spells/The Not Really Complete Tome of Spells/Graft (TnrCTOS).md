# Graft (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a *potion of healing* and 1,000 gp worth of powdered moonstone)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You may graft the limb of one creature to the stump of another.

The limb may be from a creature that is no more than one size category larger or smaller than you. It must also be the same sort of limb—you cannot graft a leg to the stump of an arm. Regardless of the Strength of the original creature, you use your own Strength with the arm.

The appendage retains its original AC and keeps any physical attacks it originally have (such as claws). It does not retain any of the original creature’s magical abilities, magic resistance, or any other supernatural abili-ties native to that creature.
