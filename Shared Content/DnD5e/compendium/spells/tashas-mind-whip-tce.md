# Tasha's Mind Whip
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 round

You psychically lash out at one creature you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 psychic damage, and it can't take a reaction until the end of its next turn. Moreover, on its next turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and suffers none of the spell's other effects.

**Classes**: Rogue (Arcane Trickster), Sorcerer, Wizard
