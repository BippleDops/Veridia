*Aaztar-gholas are ancient creatures originating from some other dimension, foul things that have established themselves in the prime material plane. They attire their tall, hideous bodies in flowing, richly embroidered robes, adorning themselves with strange, baroque jewelry.*

**Alignment**: Chaotic Evil

**Armor Class**: 13 (mage armor)

**Hit Points**: 38 (`dice: 7d8+7`)

**Speed**: 40 ft.

**Challenge**: CR 4

**Experience**: 1,100 XP

## Other Details

**Ability Scores**: STR 14 (2), DEX 11 (0),  CON 12 (1),  INT 16 (3), WIS 11 (0), CHA 12 (1)

**Skills**: History +5

**Languages**: Common, Abyssal

**Size**: Medium

**Type**: Humanoid

## Special Traits

**Arcane Fatigue:** An Aaztar-Ghola gains `dice: 1d3` levels of exhaustion when it uses its finger of death spell-like ability. It recovers fully after taking a short rest and consuming a fresh human body part.

**Dominate Ghouls (3/Day):** As a bonus action, an Aaztar-Ghola can try to dominate all ghouls within 60 feet. The Aaztar-Ghola makes a DC 8 Cha check; if it succeeds, it charms every ghoul in the area. The Aaztar-Ghola establishes a telepathic link to affected creatures, and they do their best to carry out its simple commands. This charm lasts for one hour. Ghouls under this affect have tactical advantage on Wis saving throws against being turned. If any ghouls the Aaztar-Ghola is trying to charm are currently turned by a cleric, the Aaztar-Ghola has tactical disadvantage on its Cha check.

**Mage Armor:** An Aaztar-Ghola always has mage armor cast on itself.

## Actions

**Multiattack:** The Aaztar-Ghola attacks twice with its scimitar.

**Scimitar:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d6+2`) slashing damage.

**Spell-like Abilities:** The aaztar-Ghola can use the following spell-like abilities, using Intelligence as its casting ability (DC 13, attack +5). The Aaztar-Ghola doesn’t need material components to cast these spells.

- 2/day: *inflict wounds (range 50 ft.), fear*

- 1/day: *dispel magic, finger of death, fly, see invisibility*

## Ecology

**Environment**: Any

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description

Aaztar-gholas find human flesh delectable, especially when it is cooked with the strange spices of their distant homeland. An aaztar-ghola lair often contains cauldrons, skewers, and more alien and disturbing culinary implements.

Aaztar-gholas have a necromantic affinity with ghouls and ghasts, which obey their commands without any perceptible reluctance. The lair of an aaztar-ghola is 90% likely to be guarded by a pack of `dice: 2d6 + 6` ghouls. In the presence of an aaztar-ghola, ghouls are highly resistant to being turned; they have tactical advantage on saving throws against turning. Ghasts are also willing to serve aaztar-gholas, but they do so for their own purposes. They are unaffected by the strange control that aaztar-gholas have over ordinary ghouls. Aaztar-gholas themselves are not undead and can’t be turned, although as creatures not inherently native to the prime material plane they are affected by protection from evil.

These horrid creatures are natural adepts of the necromantic arts, and all of them have inherent spellcasting powers. The most fearsome of these is finger of death. Because of its debilitating effect on them, however, aaztargholas save it as a last resort, using it to destroy a final enemy, to ensure their escape from a bad situation, or as a last, spiteful act before dying. They always have mage armor cast on themselves, whether or not they expect trouble. Aaztar-gholas are capable of speaking with any sort of undead creature, even those that have no intellect at all such as zombies. This ability to communicate with the undead does not imply the ability to control; ghouls are the only undead creatures that automatically follow commands given by an aaztar-ghola.
