# Memory Farmers Combat

*"They harvest thoughts as others reap grain, and their scythes cut deeper than flesh."*

## Overview
Memory Farmers Combat encompasses the unique tactical approaches and abilities used by the mysterious Memory Farmers when forced into battle. These entities combine traditional physical combat with memory-based attacks that can steal experiences, implant false memories, or create confusion by manipulating a target's recollections during the heat of battle.

## Historical Background
Memory Farmers were initially discovered by underwater explorers who found their deep-sea gardens of crystallized thoughts. Early encounters were avoided rather than fought, as the farmers seemed content to tend their memory crops.

## Current State
As dimensional barriers weaken, Memory Farmers have become more territorial and aggressive, leading to inevitable combat encounters with explorers and adventurers.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
- Encounter with Memory Farmers in their territory
- Protection against memory-based attacks recommended
- Strong mental defenses or magical protection
- Ability to distinguish real from implanted memories

### Effects
- **Memory Drain**: Farmers can steal recent memories during combat
- **False Implants**: Insert confusing or terrifying false memories
- **Experience Theft**: Temporarily remove combat skills and abilities
- **Confusion Fields**: Create areas where memory becomes unreliable

### Duration
Combat typically lasts until farmers retreat to protect their memory crops.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Garden Invasion**: Characters accidentally trespass on memory farm territory
2. **Stolen Memories**: Must recover important memories taken by farmers
3. **Farmer Alliance**: Negotiate with farmers for access to specific memories

## Campaign Use
Provides unique combat challenges that affect character abilities and create lasting psychological consequences.
