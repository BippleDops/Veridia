# Physics Denial

The ship forgets which way is down. Tools slide toward the wall that thinks it’s a floor.

What you feel
- Your balance lies to you
- The hull groans in a strange direction

What you can try
- Anchor yourselves and the ship’s song
- Move with care

Possible outcomes
- You ride it out
- Something breaks loose
- The world tilts the wrong way
