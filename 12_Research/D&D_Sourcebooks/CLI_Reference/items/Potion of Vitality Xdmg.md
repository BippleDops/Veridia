# Potion of Vitality
*Potion, very rare*  


- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, it removes any [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] levels you have and ends the [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition on you. For the next 24 hours, you regain the maximum number of [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] for any [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Point]] Die you spend.

This potion's crimson liquid regularly pulses with dull light, calling to mind a heartbeat.
