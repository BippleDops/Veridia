# Malnutrition
*Generic Hazard*  

A creature needs an amount of food per day based on its size, as shown in the Food Needs per Day table. A creature that eats but consumes less than half the required food for a day must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution [[saving-throw-xphb|saving throw]] or gain 1 [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] level at the day's end. A creature that eats nothing for 5 days automatically gains 1 [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] level at the end of the fifth day as well as an additional level at the end of each subsequent day without food.

[[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] caused by malnutrition can't be removed until the creature eats the full amount of food required for a day.

**Food Needs per Day**

| Tiny | 1/4 pound |
| Small | 1 pound |
| Medium | 1 pound |
| Large | 4 pounds |
| Huge | 16 pounds |
