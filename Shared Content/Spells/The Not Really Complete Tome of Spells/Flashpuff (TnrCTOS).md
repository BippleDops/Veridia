# Flashpuff (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *cantrip*

**School**: *Evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 10 feet

**Components**: S, M (a pinch of a white pow-der, such as flour)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You throw a pinch of powder into a burning fire and it causes a brilliant flash of light and a cloud of colorful smoke (one or two colors of your choice). All creatures within 10 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 round.

You can sculpt the smoke into a simple, two-dimensional image for as long as you concentrate on it (up to 1 minute), or you can use the flash and smoke to hide a quick escape.
