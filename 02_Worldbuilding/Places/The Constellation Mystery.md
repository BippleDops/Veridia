# The Constellation Mystery

*"When stars align beneath the waves, ancient truths surface."*

## Overview
A mystical investigation where the underwater constellation patterns visible from Aquabyssos have begun changing, causing magical disturbances throughout the city. Ancient star charts suggest this phenomenon occurs only during times of great cosmic significance.

Scholars and mystics believe the shifting constellations herald either great fortune or terrible catastrophe.

## The Phenomenon

## Affected Constellations
