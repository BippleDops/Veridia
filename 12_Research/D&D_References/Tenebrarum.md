## Overview
Tenebrarum is the official ambassador from the Void Realms to [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], representing entities that exist in the spaces between reality. Neither malevolent nor benevolent from mortal perspectives, they conduct diplomacy for beings whose very existence challenges conventional understanding of life, death, and meaning. Their embassy exists in a pocket of controlled nothingness within the Deep Parliament District, where they negotiate treaties that most senators don't fully understand.

### Interaction Manifestations
**During Negotiations**
- Becomes more solid and defined when focused
- Emanates gentle authority that compels respectful listening
- Diplomatic seal appears floating beside themâ€”symbol shifts and changes
- Voice gains harmonic undertones that promote understanding

**Under Stress**
- Form becomes less stable, edges wavering
- Star-filled interior dims and darkens
- Surrounding temperature drops significantly
- Reality seems to thin in their immediate vicinity

### Building Description
**Location**: Parliament Deep District, occupying space that shouldn't exist
**Architecture**: Impossible geometry that makes sense while inside
**Interior**: Rooms sized according to negotiation needs, gravity optional
**Staff**: Void-touched clerks and scribes who speak in mathematical formulas
**Security**: Protected by conceptual barriers rather than physical guards

### Diplomatic Services
1. **Treaty Negotiation**: Between any parties, mortal or otherwise
2. **Neutral Mediation**: Absolutely impartial conflict resolution
3. **Reality Arbitration**: Disputes over what is actually real
4. **Temporal Agreements**: Contracts spanning multiple timelines
5. **Existential Counseling**: For beings questioning their nature

### Successful Treaties
1. **The Existence Protocols**: Established rights for partially-real beings
2. **Deep Space Fishing Rights**: Prevented interdimensional conflict
3. **The Silence Accords**: Regulated use of weaponized quiet
4. **Reality Revision Guidelines**: Limited unauthorized timeline editing
5. **The Non-Aggression Void**: Established neutral zones in space-between

### Tenebrarum as Quest Giver
1. **The Reality Audit**: Help investigate unauthorized changes to local physics
2. **Lost Ambassador**: Locate diplomatic envoy who fell between dimensions
3. **The Impossible Treaty**: Deliver agreement to location that doesn't exist
4. **Void Refugee Crisis**: Help integrate displaced entities into Aquabyssos society
5. **The Negotiation**: Participate in treaty talks with beings beyond mortal understanding

### Formal Addresses
*"I bring greetings from the Spaces That Are Not, yet Hope to Become."*

*"My superiors in the Void Realms have considered your proposal across seventeen different probability matrices."*

*"By the Authority vested in me by the Council of Eternal Emptiness, I am empowered to negotiate on behalf of Nothing Itself."*

### Negotiation Language
*"Your position is noted and will be weighted against the cosmic constants."*

*"Perhaps we might consider an alternative that serves both existence and void."*

*"Time is not a factor in our deliberations, though I understand it constrains your perspective."*

### Philosophical Observations
*"You fear the void, yet you emerged from it and shall return to it. We merely represent your origins and destination."*

*"Reality is but one option among infinite possibilities. Treaties expand the available choices."*

### Meeting Procedures
1. **Formal Introduction**: Full titles and representing authorities
2. **Neutrality Acknowledgment**: Confirmation of diplomatic immunity
3. **Agenda Setting**: Clear statement of negotiation goals
4. **Reality Stabilization**: Ensuring consistent physics during talks
5. **Progress Markers**: Regular verification of understanding
