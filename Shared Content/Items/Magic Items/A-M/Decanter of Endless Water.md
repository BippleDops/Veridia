## Description
This stoppered [[Flask or Tankard|flask]] sloshes when shaken, as if it contains [[9 - The Environment|water]]. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.

You can use an action to remove the stopper and speak one of three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh [[9 - The Environment|water]] or salt water (your choice) pours out of the [[Flask or Tankard|flask]]. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following options:

- “Stream” produces 1 gallon of [[9 - The Environment|water]].
- “Fountain” produces 5 gallons of [[9 - The Environment|water]].
- “Geyser” produces 30 gallons of [[9 - The Environment|water]] that gushes forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a [[12 - The Order of Combat|bonus action]] while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 13 [[Strength|Strength]] saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall [[13 - Movement and Position|prone]]. Instead of a creature, you can target an object that isn’t being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you.
