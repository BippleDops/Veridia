## Description
Where lockpicks require finesse and time, hacksaws only require time. All our blades are constructed by dwarven craftsmen and made of fire-hardened steel; our common blades can cut through anything made of steel or softer material. Our superior-grade blades, toothed with diamond chips, can cut any material of lesser hardness than diamond. Common: 5 gp; Superior: 20 gp.

## Additional Details
Either blade cuts one quarter-inch square per round; common blades last ten uses, superior last twenty.
