# Reverse Gravity
*7th-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and iron filings)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]] centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects in that area that aren't anchored to the ground fall upward and reach the top of the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]]. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab a fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall upward.

If a ceiling or an anchored object is encountered in this upward fall, creatures and objects strike it just as they would during a downward fall. If an affected creature or object reaches the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]]'s top without striking anything, it hovers there for the duration. When the spell ends, affected objects and creatures fall downward.
