# Gloves of Missile Snaring
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/gloves-of-missile-snaring.webp#right)


If you're hit by an attack roll made with a Ranged or Thrown weapon while wearing these gloves, you can take a [Reaction](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to reduce the damage by `d10` plus your Dexterity modifier if you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the ammunition or weapon if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.
