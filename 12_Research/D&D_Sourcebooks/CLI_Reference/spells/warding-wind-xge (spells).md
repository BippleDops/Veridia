# Warding Wind
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A strong wind (20 miles per hour) blows around you in a 10-foot radius and moves with you, remaining centered on you. The wind lasts for the spell's duration.

The wind has the following effects:

- It [[conditions#Deafened|deafens]] you and other creatures in its area.  
- It extinguishes unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller.  
- It hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind.  
- The area is difficult terrain for creatures other than you.  
- The attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if the attacks pass in or out of the wind.
