# Dynamite Stick
*Explosive*  


- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

An an action, you can light a Dynamite Stick and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away, where it explodes. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius [Sphere](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on that point makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking `3d6` Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

It takes 1 minute to bind two or more Dynamite Sticks together so they explode at the same time. Each stick after the first increases the damage by `d6` (to a maximum of `10d6`) and the effect's radius by 5 feet (to a maximum of 20 feet).

It takes 1 minute to rig dynamite with a longer fuse so it explodes after a longer period of time, such as 1 minute or 10 minutes.
