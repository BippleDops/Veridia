## Description
As unpleasant as it may be, among the chiefest use of chains is binding prisoners (whether rightly or wrongly). We offer head and hand stocks in single (6 gp) and double (10 gp) varieties, as well as ankle stocks in single (3 gp) and double (7 gp) types. When used in conjunction with our sharpened bench (8 gp), these stocks can truly bring rehabilitation. 

Our shackles come in sets that include a neck ring, two arm rings, two leg rings, and the wall mounts for each. (10 gp) We do not sell the so-called “maiden’s yoke,” which has spikes within the shackles.
