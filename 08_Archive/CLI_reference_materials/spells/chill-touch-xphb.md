# Chill Touch
*cantrip, Necromancy*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Channeling the chill of the grave, make a melee spell attack against a target within reach. On a hit, the target takes `d10` Necrotic damage, and it can't regain [Hit Points](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) until the end of your next turn.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by `d10` when you reach levels 5 (`2d10`), 11 (`3d10`), and 17 (`4d10`).

**Classes**: [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Warlock](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Sorcerer](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Cleric (Death Domain)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-death-domain-dmg.md "subclass=DMG;class=XPHB"); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard (College of Lore)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
