# Armor of Vulnerability

## Overview
**Type**: Magic Item

**Group**: [[2 - Armor|Armor]]* ([[Plate|plate]])*

**Rarity**: *rare*

**Attunement**: *requires attunement*

**Weight**:  1 lb.

## Description
While wearing this [[2 - Armor|armor]], you have [[17 - Damage and Healing|resistance]] to one of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, or [[17 - Damage and Healing|slashing]]. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly.

***Curse.*** This [[2 - Armor|armor]] is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an [[Identify|identify]]** spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the [[Remove Curse|remove curse]]** spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have [[17 - Damage and Healing|vulnerability]] to two of the three damage types associated with the [[2 - Armor|armor]] (not the one to which it grants [[17 - Damage and Healing|resistance]]).
