# The Harbor Depths
*Where Surface Meets Abyss, The Drowned Foundation of Port Meridian*

## Overview
The Harbor Depths represent the submerged underbelly of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]], where the bustling surface port gives way to a treacherous underwater realm.

Crystal corruption seeps up from below while surface pollutants sink down, creating a unique and hazardous environment.
