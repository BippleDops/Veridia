# Lorloveim's Creeping Shadow (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *illusion*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a source of light and a small statuette of yourself made out of obsid-ian)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
Your shadow elongates and stretches away from your body, moving under your mental command. It has a speed of 15 feet and can move up to 150 feet away from you.

You can see, hear, and speak through the shadow, although it is otherwise a normal shadow and you cannot use it to manipulate objects, attack, or cast spells. Your shadow can be attacked with magical weapons and spells, although it has resistance to all forms of physical attack. It has your AC and any damage it takes is taken from your hit points. You can also spend you action to move your shadowâ€™s senses into the Shadowfell, although you still cannot affect other objects through it.
