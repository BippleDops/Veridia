## Description
There are probably as many different styles of caps and hats as there are people in Toril. We always keep a choice supply on hand. We have berets, stocking caps, skull caps, fur-lined hunting hats (with ear flaps, if desired), turbans, hoods, and coifs. A variety of materials are used for our hats and caps, including linen, wool, leather, and fur (doubles cost). Silk and felt may be specified in special order, and at triple cost. Most hats and caps: 1 sp; turbans and berets: 3 sp; fur lining adds 1 silver piece. Colors are available as per [[Capes|capes]].
