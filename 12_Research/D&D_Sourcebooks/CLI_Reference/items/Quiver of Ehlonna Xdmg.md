- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to 60 [[arrow-xphb|Arrows]], [[bolt-xphb|Bolts]], or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to 18 [[javelin-xphb|Javelins]] or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to 6 long objects, such as bows, [[quarterstaff-xphb|Quarterstaff's]], or [[spear-xphb|Spears]].

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.
