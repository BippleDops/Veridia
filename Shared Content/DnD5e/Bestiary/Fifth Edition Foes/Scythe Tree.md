## Description
Scythe trees are malevolent plants that live in dense forest, where they blend in with normal trees around them. Scythe trees are carnivorous by nature and draw very little sustenance from sun, air, or earth, preferring a diet of dryad or elf flesh.

Scythe trees average 20 feet in height, but they can reach or even exceed heights of 30 feet, with a trunk diameter of 3 feet. Their bark is dark brown, becoming darker near the roots. What few leaves a scythe tree has are reddish-brown year-round; they don’t change color or fall off as the seasons change.

The branches of a scythe tree curve like scythes (hence the tree’s name). The scar on its trunk is the tree’s mouth. Scythe trees hate treants and dryads. They attack dryads on sight, but they steer clear of treants unless the scythe trees have a significant numbers advantage.

A scythe tree stands motionless, appearing to be a normal tree, until prey comes within range. Then it slashes with its scythe-like limbs in an effort to cut its foe into bite-size pieces.
