# Searing Song (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Special

**Components**: V

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You sing a deadly song. This can have one of two different effects:

♦ You shout the song. It forms a line of solid air aimed at one target within 60 feet. That creature may make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 4d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

♦ You touch a creature, and the song’s vibrations melt the creature’s flesh. You use your spell attack modifier to hit. On a hit, this inflicts 5d10 acid damage.

Although this is a dangerous song, deaf-ness does not protect against it.
