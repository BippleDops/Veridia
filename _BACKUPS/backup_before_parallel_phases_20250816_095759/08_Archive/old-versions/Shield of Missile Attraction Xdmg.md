Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by a [[Remove Curse Xphb]] spell or similar magic. Removing the Shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever an attack with a Ranged weapon targets a creature within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 304.
