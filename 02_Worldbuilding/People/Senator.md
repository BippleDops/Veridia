## Special Abilities

**Political Immunity.** Cordelia has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened by creatures of lower social standing. Government officials must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma save to take hostile action against her.

**Tide of Influence.** Once per day, Cordelia can spend 10 minutes speaking to influence a crowd of up to 100 people. Each creature must make a DC 17 Wisdom save or have their attitude shifted one step toward her position on any political issue.

**Network of Spies.** Cordelia can attempt to gather information about any person or event in Aquabyssos. This functions as a *legend lore* spell with a casting time of 1 hour and no material components.

**Amphibious.** Cordelia can breathe air and water.

**Spellcasting.** Cordelia is an 11th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit). She has the following spells prepared:
- Cantrips (at will): *minor illusion*, *prestidigitation*, *mage hand*, *friends*
- 1st level (4 slots): *charm person*, *detect magic*, *comprehend languages*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *suggestion*, *detect thoughts*, *hold person*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell*, *tongues*, *sending*
- 4th level (3 slots): *charm monster*, *confusion*, *polymorph*
- 5th level (2 slots): *dominate person*, *modify memory*, *geas*
- 6th level (1 slot): *mass suggestion*, *mental prison*

## Actions

**Multiattack.** Cordelia makes two Elegant Rebuke attacks or casts a spell and makes one attack.

**Elegant Rebuke.** *Melee Spell Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) psychic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom save or be stunned until the end of their next turn as they're overwhelmed by shame and social anxiety.

**Parliamentary Decree (3/Day).** Cordelia speaks with the authority of the Parliament. One creature within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma save or be compelled to follow a reasonable, non-harmful command for up to 1 hour.

**Scandal Revelation (1/Day).** Cordelia reveals a damaging secret about a target within 60 feet. The target takes 21 (6d6) psychic damage and must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma save or have disadvantage on Charisma-based rolls for 24 hours as their reputation suffers.

## Description

Senator Cordelia Deepcurrent epitomizes the sophisticated power broker of Aquabyssos politics. Her elegant merfolk physique is enhanced by centuries of selective breeding among the political elite—scales that shimmer with an iridescent blue-green that seems to shift with her moods, and flowing fins that move with practiced grace even in the densest political waters.

Standing 5'6" with an aristocratic bearing, Cordelia adorns herself in the finest coral jewelry and silk garments that flow like water around her form. Her most distinctive feature is her voice—melodious and hypnotic, capable of swaying hearts and minds with equal ease. When she speaks in the Parliament chambers, even her enemies listen.

She represents the Deepcurrent District, the wealthiest area of Aquabyssos, where the most influential families maintain their ancestral coral mansions. Her political philosophy centers on maintaining Aquabyssos's independence while carefully managing the delicate relationship with surface dwellers and the growing shadow threat.

## Equipment

- **Trident of Parliamentary Authority** (symbol of office that can cast *command* 3/day)
- **Robes of Political Influence** (advantage on Persuasion checks against government officials)
- **Ring of Mind Shielding** (protects against mental intrusion)
- **Pearl of Wisdom** (allows her to recall any conversation perfectly)
- **Sending Stone Network** (connected to her political allies)
- **Diplomatic Immunity Seal** (official document granting legal protections)

## Relationships

**Allies:**
- **[[Parliament Loyalists]]** - Her primary political faction, though she maneuvers to lead rather than follow
- **[[Emperor Thalassius the Wise]]** - Maintains cordial relations while quietly positioning for more power
- **[[Banker Titus Goldcurrent]]** - Her cousin and financial advisor who helps fund her political operations
- **[[Ambassador Nerida Deepcurrent]]** - Her sister, serving as the diplomatic arm of their family's ambitions

**Enemies:**
- **[[Shadow Parliament]]** - She sees them as a direct threat to legitimate government
- **[[The Coral Throne Syndicate]]** - Criminal organizations that corrupt the political process
- **Reform Movement** - Radical politicians who want to democratize the Parliament system

**Complicated:**
- **[[Senator Glaucus]]** - Political rival who she respects but fundamentally disagrees with on key issues
- **[[Prince Caspian Duskwater]]** - She suspects him of shadow corruption but lacks definitive proof
- **[[Surface Ambassador Lord Seaworthy]]** - Navigates the complex relationship between surface and depth politics

## Quest Hooks

1. **The Corruption Investigation** - Cordelia discovers evidence that several senators are taking bribes from [[The Coral Throne Syndicate]]. She needs discrete investigators to gather proof without alerting the criminals or causing a government crisis.

2. **The Shadow Bill** - A piece of legislation is making its way through Parliament that seems innocuous but would actually give shadow entities legal rights in Aquabyssos. Cordelia needs help uncovering who's really behind this bill and stopping it.

3. **The Diplomatic Crisis** - Tensions with Aethermoor are escalating, and Cordelia believes war profiteers are deliberately sabotaging peace negotiations. She requires agents who can operate in both realms to expose the conspiracy.

4. **The Blackmail Network** - Someone has been gathering compromising information on Parliament members, including Cordelia herself. She needs the party to track down the blackmailer while keeping her own secrets safe.

5. **The Constitutional Convention** - Cordelia is secretly organizing a convention to reform Aquabyssos's government, but she needs evidence of the current system's failures and protection from those who would kill to maintain the status quo.

## Secrets

- **The Deepcurrent Fortune**: Her family's wealth comes from an ancient contract with sea devils, trading souls for political power across generations.
- **The Double Agent**: She's been feeding information to both [[Parliament Loyalists]] and moderate shadow factions, playing all sides to maintain stability.
- **The Succession Plan**: Cordelia is secretly working to position herself as [[Emperor Thalassius the Wise]]'s successor, believing she can modernize Aquabyssos without revolution.
- **The Surface Connection**: She has been in covert communication with surface world leaders, negotiating potential trade agreements that bypass traditional diplomatic channels.
- **The Memory Archive**: She possesses a collection of extracted memories from political opponents, giving her devastating blackmail material but also making her a target.

## Motivations

**Primary**: Maintain Aquabyssos's stability while positioning herself for greater power
**Secondary**: Modernize the government without triggering revolution or civil war
**Hidden**: Prove that political solutions can triumph over both shadow corruption and military force

## Roleplaying Notes

**Personality**: Charming and eloquent in public, calculatingly pragmatic in private. Never loses her composure but can be ruthlessly manipulative when necessary.

**Ideals**: "True power lies not in commanding others, but in convincing them they want to be commanded. The greatest victories are won with words, not weapons."

**Bonds**: "My loyalty is to Aquabyssos itself—not any individual ruler or faction. The realm must survive and thrive, whatever the cost to my personal honor."

**Flaws**: "I believe I can outsmart anyone and outmaneuver any situation. Sometimes my own schemes become so complex that I lose track of which version of the truth I'm telling to whom."

**Voice**: Melodious and hypnotic, with perfect diction that makes even casual conversation sound like a prepared speech. She modulates her tone masterfully—warm and inviting for allies, coolly professional for rivals.

**Speaking Patterns**: 
- "In the interests of our great realm..."
- "Perhaps we might find a mutually beneficial arrangement..."
- "I'm sure you understand the delicate nature of the situation..."
- "History will judge us by our wisdom, not our good intentions..."

**Mannerisms**: Always perfectly groomed and composed. She has a habit of touching her pearl necklace when thinking deeply, and her fins flutter slightly when she's annoyed (though she tries to suppress this tell). She never interrupts others but somehow always gets the last word in any conversation.
