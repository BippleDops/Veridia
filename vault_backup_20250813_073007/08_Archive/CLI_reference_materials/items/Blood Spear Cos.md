# Blood Spear
*Weapon ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/spear-xphb|spear]]), uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/blood-spear.webp#right)

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 piercing
  - Two-handed: 1d8 piercing
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties#Thrown|Thrown]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties#Versatile|Versatile]]

Kavan was a ruthless chieftain whose tribe lived in the Balinok Mountains centuries before the arrival of [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/strahd-von-zarovich-cos|Strahd von Zarovich]]. Although he was very much alive, Kavan had some traits in common with vampires: he slept during the day and hunted at night, he drank the blood of his prey, and he lived underground. In battle, he wielded a spear stained with blood. His was the first blood spear, a weapon that drains life from those it kills and transfers that life to its wielder, imbuing that individual with the stamina to keep fighting.

When you hit with a melee attack using this magic spear and reduce the target to 0 hit points, you gain `2d6` temporary hit points.

Any creature can wield the spear, but only the character chosen by Kavan to wield it gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
