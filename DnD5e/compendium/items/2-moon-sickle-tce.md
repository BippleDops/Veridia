This silver-bladed sickle glimmers softly with moonlight. While holding this magic weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your druid and ranger spells. In addition, you can use the sickle as a spellcasting focus for your druid and ranger spells.

When you cast a spell that restores hit points, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the amount of hit points restored, provided you are holding the sickle.
