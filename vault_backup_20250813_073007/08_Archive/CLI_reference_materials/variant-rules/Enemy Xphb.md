# Enemy
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 366. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A creature is your enemy if it fights against you in combat, actively works to harm you, or is designated as your enemy by the rules or DM.

## Player-Facing Summary

Enemy xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of enemy xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around enemy xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties enemy xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at enemy xphb to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to enemy xphb active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
