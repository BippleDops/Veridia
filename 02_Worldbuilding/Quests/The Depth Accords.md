# The Depth Accords

*An ancient treaty between surface dwellers and the depths of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] has been broken, and the characters must navigate treacherous political waters—both literal and metaphorical—to prevent an all-out war between the realms.*

## Quest Overview

**Level Range:** 8-12  
**Estimated Duration:** 6-8 sessions  
**Quest Type:** Diplomatic Mission, Ancient Mystery, Underwater Adventure

Deep beneath the waves of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], an ancient pact known as the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Depth Accords]] has maintained peace between the surface kingdoms and the mysterious [[Abyssal Courts]] for over a millennium. When the sacred [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Coral Throne]] is shattered and the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Leviathan Princes]] begin mobilizing their armies, the characters are chosen as unlikely ambassadors to restore the accords before the depths rise to reclaim the surface world.

## Background: The Original Accords

One thousand years ago, the surface kingdoms of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] were locked in a devastating war with the [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Deep Ones]], ancient beings who ruled the ocean's depths. The conflict ended only when the legendary diplomat [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Admiral Cordelia Tidewright]] negotiated the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Depth Accords]]—a complex treaty that established:

- Territorial boundaries between surface and deep-sea realms
- Trade agreements for rare [[Abyssal Pearls]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Sunlight Crystals]]
- Mutual non-aggression pacts
- The sacred [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Coral Throne]] as a neutral meeting ground
- Ritualistic renewal ceremonies every century

The accords were sealed with powerful magic, binding both realms to honor their terms. But now the throne lies shattered, and ancient powers stir in the depths.

## Act I: The Shattering (Levels 8-9)

### The Inciting Incident
The quest begins when [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Captain Marina Saltborn]] of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Aquabyssos Royal Navy]] recruits the characters after the [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Coral Throne]] is mysteriously destroyed during what should have been a routine renewal ceremony.
