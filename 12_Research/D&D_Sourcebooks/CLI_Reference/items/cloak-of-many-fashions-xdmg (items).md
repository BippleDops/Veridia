--- # Cloak of Many Fashions

*Wondrous item, common* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/cloak-of-many-fashions.webp#right) While wearing this cloak, you can take a [[Action Xphb]] to change the style, color, and apparent quality of the garment. The cloak's weight doesn't change. Regardless of its appearance, the cloak can't be anything but a cloak. Although it can duplicate the appearance of other magic cloaks, it doesn't gain their magical properties. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 245* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Cloak of many fashions xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
