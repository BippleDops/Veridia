# Prevent Resonance Cascade

*"When magic itself begins to unravel, heroes must act before reality tears apart."*

## Overview
Preventing a Resonance Cascade involves stopping the catastrophic chain reaction that occurs when magical energies between Aquabyssos and Aethermoor become destabilized and begin feeding back on themselves. This phenomenon threatens to tear apart the barriers between realms, potentially destroying both worlds in a cascade of uncontrolled magical energy.

The cascade begins when dimensional stress points reach critical thresholds, causing magic itself to become unstable. Spells begin failing unpredictably, magical items overload, and reality itself starts to warp around areas of high magical concentration.

## Historical Background
Resonance cascades were first theorized after minor magical feedback events during early inter-realm magical experiments. The devastating potential was confirmed when a small-scale cascade destroyed an entire research facility, creating a permanent magical dead zone.

## Current State
Warning signs of an impending major cascade are becoming apparent: increased magical instability, dimensional barrier fluctuations, and reports of reality distortions in high-magic areas. Prevention requires coordinated action across both realms.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
- Identification of cascade initiation points
- Coordinated magical stabilization efforts
- Neutralization of overcharged magical sources
- Evacuation of high-risk areas

### Effects
- **Cascade Prevention**: Stops reality-threatening magical disaster
- **Stability Restoration**: Returns magical environment to normal parameters
- **Hero Recognition**: Success brings acclaim from both realms
- **Failure Consequences**: Cascade continues with increasing severity

### Duration
Prevention efforts must be completed within days or hours once cascade signs appear.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Early Warning**: Characters detect the first signs of cascade formation
2. **Emergency Response**: Racing against time to prevent cascade initiation
3. **Damage Control**: Managing the aftermath of a partially successful prevention effort

## Campaign Use
Ideal for high-stakes adventures where character actions have world-changing consequences. Can serve as campaign climax or major story arc resolution.

## Player-Facing Summary

Prevent Resonance Cascade is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Prevent Resonance Cascade as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Prevent Resonance Cascade.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
