^1-saving-throw *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 342* ## Player-Facing Summary Meditation chamber is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of meditation chamber as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around meditation chamber. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The First Prophecy of Shadows ## Plot Hooks - Someone is hunting a artifact for revenge
