## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting.*** The planetar's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 20). The planetar can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: *detect evil and good, invisibility (self only)*
3/day each: *blade barrier, dispel evil and good, flame strike, raise dead*
1/day each: *commune, control weather, insect plague*

***Angelic Weapons.*** The planetar's weapon attacks are magical. When the planetar hits with any weapon, the weapon deals an extra `dice: 5d8` radiant damage (included in the attack).

***Divine Awareness.*** The planetar knows if it hears a lie.

***Magic Resistance.*** The planetar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The planetar makes two melee attacks.

***Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (`dice: 4d6+7`) slashing damage plus 22 (`dice: 5d8`) radiant damage.

***Healing Touch (4/Day).*** The planetar touches another creature. The target magically regains 30 (`dice: 6d8+3`) hit points and is freed from any curse, disease, poison, blindness, or deafness.

## Description
Planetars act as the weapons of the gods they serve, presenting a tangible representation of their deities' might. A planetar can call down rain to relieve a drought, or can loose an insect plague to devour crops. A planetar's celestial ears detect every falsehood, and its radiant eyes see through every deception.

Planetars are muscular and hairless and have opalescent green skin and white-feathered wings. They tower over most humanoids, brandishing immense swords with grace. Sometimes sent to aid powerful mortals on important tasks for good, planetars are especially fond of missions that involve battling fiends.

***Immortal Nature.*** An [[Angels|angel]] doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.
