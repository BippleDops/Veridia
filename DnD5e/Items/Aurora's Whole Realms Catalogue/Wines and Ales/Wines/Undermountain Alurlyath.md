## Description
A surprisingly sweet white wine with a slightly nutty aftertaste, this wine is a rare and limited annual acquisition. Its wonderful taste and full body are further enhanced for romantic evenings by its prominent silver and green luminescence; it is stored in ceramic bottles and kegs to prevent its light from fading during transport. Without contacts to its secret creators, one cannot even buy more than a hand keg from Skullport, its port of origin. Although my Waterdhavian buyer will not divulge the location of the winery within Undermountain’s confines, I have translated the elvish name of the wine to mean “Best of the Temple.” Ceramic bottle (1 qt.), 5 sp; hand keg, 30 sp; cask, 8 gp.
