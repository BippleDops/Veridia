# Reality Breach Locations

*"Here the world grows thin, and through the cracks, She watches."*

## Overview

Reality Breach Locations are sites where the barrier between normal existence and the Deep Mother's dream-realm has been worn thin or deliberately weakened. These areas serve as manifestation points for eldritch phenomena, gathering sites for cultists, and dangerous zones where the laws of physics become unreliable. Each location represents a wound in reality itself, slowly expanding as the Deep Mother's influence grows.

## Major Breach Sites

### The Sunken Cathedral (Primary Manifestation Site)
**Location**: 2 miles below Aquabyssos, in the Mariana Reach  
**Breach Intensity**: Catastrophic (Level 5)  
**Discovery DC**: 25 (requires specialized deep-sea equipment)

#### Description
Once the Grand Cathedral of Tidal Harmony, this massive structure was pulled into the depths during the first recorded manifestation event 47 years ago. The building itself exists in a state of architectural impossibility - its spires extend both upward and downward simultaneously, its halls connect to rooms that should not fit within its dimensions, and its prayer pools contain water from oceans that don't exist.

#### Manifestations
- **Pressure Paradox**: Interior pressure is simultaneously crushing and nonexistent
- **Temporal Echoes**: Witness services from before the sinking, prayers continue eternally
- **Living Architecture**: Walls breathe, stained glass windows show moving scenes of drowning
- **The Deep Choir**: Voices of the drowned sing hymns that drive listeners mad
- **Probability Distortion**: Navigation fails, visitors arrive in rooms they didn't intend to find

#### Current Inhabitants
- **High Oracle Serenity Deepcall**: The cathedral's transformed former priestess
- **47 Drowned Congregants**: Eternally singing the Deep Mother's praise
- **3 Void Shepherds**: Guide lost souls to their doom
- **The Living Altar**: A fusion of stone and flesh that processes sacrifices

#### Adventure Hooks
- Rescue mission for missing deep-sea explorers
- Retrieve the Sacred Tide Bell to disrupt cult rituals
- Confront High Oracle to learn Deep Mother's next move
- Destroy or sanctify the corrupted altar

### The Observatory of Broken Stars
**Location**: Mount Celestialis Peak, Aethermoor  
**Breach Intensity**: Major (Level 4)  
**Discovery DC**: 18 (visible from miles away as "wrong" light)

#### Description
This astronomical observatory was built at the highest point in Aethermoor to study celestial movements. When researchers attempted to map stars that "shouldn't exist," their instruments began receiving transmissions from the Deep Mother. The facility now exists partially in space, partially underwater, and partially in dimensions that lack names.

#### Manifestations
- **Stellar Displacement**: Telescopes show underwater scenes instead of sky
- **Gravity Inversion**: Observatory exists simultaneously at mountaintop and ocean floor
- **Void Windows**: Some telescope lenses show the space between spaces
- **Time Dilation**: Minutes outside equal hours inside, or vice versa
- **Star-Drowned Staff**: Researchers who became living constellations

#### Aberrant Features
- **The Reflecting Pool**: Telescope mirror now shows Deep Mother's dreams
- **Underwater Observatory**: Identical facility exists in deepest ocean
- **The Star Charts**: Maps that predict reality collapses
- **Breathing Vacuum**: Observatory contains breathable emptiness
- **The Final Calculation**: Equation that proves reality is temporary

#### Encounters (CR 15-20)
- **Astronomer-Prophet** (CR 16): Former researcher, now speaks in mathematical proofs of doom
- **Living Constellation** (CR 18): Star pattern gained consciousness and malevolence
- **The Observatory Itself** (CR 20): Building has become a thinking entity

### The Merchant's Folly (Convergence Breach)
**Location**: Goldwater Trading Company Warehouse District  
**Breach Intensity**: Growing (Level 3)  
**Discovery DC**: 15 (obvious to anyone with magical sensitivity)

#### Description
This began as a simple warehouse where merchant Codex Goldstream stored "unusual acquisitions." When he acquired a Deep Mother artifact without proper precautions, his entire commercial district began experiencing reality fluctuations. The area now serves as a spontaneous marketplace between dimensions, with traders from impossible realms conducting business in currency that doesn't exist.

#### Manifestations
- **Interdimensional Commerce**: Merchants sell memories, time, and abstract concepts
- **Probability Vendors**: Purchase changes to past events
- **The Living Ledger**: Account books write themselves with future transactions
- **Phantom Customers**: Buyers from timelines that never occurred
- **Currency Chaos**: Money transforms based on observer's deepest desires

#### Notable Vendors
- **Madame Elsewhere**: Sells locations that can't be reached by normal means
- **The Memory Broker**: Trades in forgotten experiences
- **Clockwork Oracle**: Mechanical fortune teller powered by temporal paradoxes
- **The Grief Merchant**: Deals exclusively in emotional pain
- **Shadow Commodities**: Vendor who exists only in peripheral vision

#### Regulatory Hazards
- DC 12 WIS save or forget why you entered
- DC 15 CON save or age 1d10 years from temporal exposure
- DC 18 CHA save or trade away a cherished memory without realizing
- Purchases may be paid for with concepts like "first love" or "peace of mind"

### The Null Gardens (Extinction Zone)
**Location**: Former Royal Botanical Gardens, Aethermoor  
**Breach Intensity**: Critical (Level 4)  
**Discovery DC**: 10 (impossible to miss - plants don't exist there)

#### Description
These once-magnificent gardens became a reality breach when researchers tried to cultivate plants from the Deep Mother's realm. Instead of growing alien flora, the gardens became a zone where the concept of growth itself ceased to exist. Plants don't die here - they never existed in the first place. The space remains beautiful in a terrifying way, as visitors see perfect garden layouts with no plants, only the spaces where plants should be.

#### Manifestations
- **Conceptual Absence**: Things that should exist simply don't
- **Negative Growth**: Plants un-grow, returning to seeds, then to nothing
- **The Gardener's Paradox**: Caretaker tends gardens that aren't there
- **Visitor Amnesia**: People forget what gardens should look like
- **Living Emptiness**: The absence has personality and intent

#### Philosophical Hazards
- DC 14 INT save or forget the concept of growth
- DC 16 WIS save or cease believing in cause and effect
- DC 20 CHA save or begin to fade from existence yourself
- Extended exposure may cause observers to become conceptually absent

#### The Absent Gardener
**Groundskeeper Void** (CR 12): Still tends the non-existent gardens with tools that aren't there. He's friendly and helpful, offering tours of flowers that bloom in the spaces between thoughts. Completely unaware that anything is wrong.

### The Echo Marina (Temporal Breach)
**Location**: Port District, Aquabyssos  
**Breach Intensity**: Moderate (Level 2)  
**Discovery DC**: 12 (ships arrive before they depart)

#### Description
This busy marina experiences severe temporal displacement due to a breach in the harbor's deepest point. Ships from past and future dock alongside present-day vessels. Cargo is unloaded before it's loaded, passengers disembark who haven't boarded yet, and harbor masters maintain schedules for voyages that both have and haven't happened.

#### Temporal Manifestations
- **Causal Loops**: Same ship arrives repeatedly from different time periods
- **Future Shipping**: Receive cargo before ordering it
- **Temporal Tourists**: Visitors from timelines visiting "historic" present day
- **The Chronicle Docks**: Piers that record events before they occur
- **Paradox Customs**: Officials process impossible documentation

#### Notable Temporal Anomalies
- **The Eternal Voyage**: Ship that's simultaneously always arriving and always departing
- **Yesterday's News**: Harbor crier announces events that haven't happened yet
- **The Temporal Harbormaster**: Exists in all time periods simultaneously
- **Memory Moorings**: Dock spaces that hold remembrances of ships, not ships themselves
- **The Future Past Office**: Postal service for mail between time periods

#### Adventure Complications
- Characters may meet their past or future selves
- Actions taken here might change previous campaign events
- Information from the future creates decision paralysis
- NPCs might remember meeting the characters before the characters meet them

- **Behavioral**: Locals act strangely but don't recognize it
- **Magical**: Spells behave unpredictably, divination provides contradictory results
- **Psychological**: Persistent feeling of being watched, dreams become shared
- **Physical**: Light bends wrong, shadows fall upward, water flows in circles

### Investigation Challenges
- **Adaptive Evidence**: Clues change when observed directly
- **Memory Interference**: Important discoveries are forgotten upon leaving
- **Temporal Confusion**: Investigation may reveal events that haven't happened yet
- **Reality Displacement**: Breach sites may not be where they appear to be
- **Witness Unreliability**: Observers may experience different versions of same events

### Breach Expansion
Breach sites grow stronger and larger over time:

| Level | Radius | Effects | Escape DC |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | 10 ft | Minor anomalies | 10 |
| 2 | 50 ft | Noticeable distortions | 13 |
| 3 | 200 ft | Reality becomes unreliable | 16 |
| 4 | 1 mile | Physics break down | 19 |
| 5 | 5+ miles | Existence becomes questionable | 22+ |

## Breach Stabilization

### Containment Methods
- **Reality Anchors**: Magical artifacts that reinforce normal physics
- **Null Shielding**: Physical barriers that block dimensional interference
- **Memory Fortification**: Mass hypnosis to reinforce "correct" reality
- **Divine Intervention**: Prayers to deities opposed to Deep Mother
- **Paradox Engines**: Machines that create controlled contradictions

### Cleansing Rituals
- **The Litany of What Is**: Repeated recitation of observable facts
- **Consensus Building**: Gathering witnesses to agree on single version of reality
- **The Anchoring Ceremony**: Binding breach to fixed points in space-time
- **Memory Restoration**: Helping affected individuals remember "true" events
- **The Final Accounting**: Mathematical proof of reality's consistency

### Warning Signs of Expansion
- Children born near breaches don't learn object permanence
- Local wildlife begins existing in multiple states simultaneously
- Documentation of breach sites becomes self-contradictory
- Emergency services report to locations that don't exist
- Residents develop philosophical positions that reality is optional

## Campaign Integration

### Investigation Progression
1. **Initial Discovery**: Strange reports dismissed as local eccentricity
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Multiple sites show similar anomalies
3. **First Contact**: Encounter with breach-affected NPCs or creatures
4. **Deep Investigation**: Explore major breach site, face serious dangers
5. **Revelation**: Understand connection to Deep Mother and cult activities
6. **Crisis Response**: Must prevent breach expansion or new breach creation
7. **Final Confrontation**: Battle in or for control of critical breach site

### Breach Sites as Campaign Tools
- **Information Sources**: Temporal breaches reveal future consequences
- **Tactical Challenges**: Unstable physics complicate combat
- **Moral Dilemmas**: Fixing breaches might harm innocent affected residents
- **Resource Acquisition**: Impossible items available through dimensional commerce
- **Character Development**: Exposure forces characters to question reality

### Escalation Timeline
- **Month 1**: Single minor breach discovered
- **Month 3**: Pattern of multiple breaches recognized
- **Month 6**: Major breach site becomes active threat
- **Month 9**: Breaches begin connecting to each other
- **Year 1**: Breach network threatens regional stability
- **Final Phase**: All breaches merge into single massive reality failure

## Player-Facing Summary

Reality Breach Locations are areas where strange phenomena occur due to "geological instabilities" or "experimental accidents." These sites feature impossible architecture, temporal anomalies, or other reality distortions. While dangerous, they may also contain valuable information or unique opportunities. Local authorities often have these areas under investigation or quarantine, though their explanations rarely match the observed phenomena.

## DM Notes

Breach sites work best as investigative locations that gradually reveal their true nature. Start with subtle wrongness that players can rationalize, then slowly introduce elements that can't be explained normally. Each breach should feel unique while supporting the overall Deep Mother narrative.

Use breaches to foreshadow major campaign events - temporal anomalies can reveal future consequences, dimensional markets can provide needed items at narrative cost, and reality distortions can force players to question their assumptions about the world.

Remember that breaches are inherently unstable - they should feel dangerous even when not hosting active encounters. The environment itself is the primary antagonist.
