### Depth Zones
The underwater realm is divided into distinct pressure zones, each with increasing dangers and requirements:

| Depth | Zone Name | Pressure DC | Effects | Adaptation Required |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| 0-500 ft | Sunlight Zone | DC 10 | Disadvantage on Perception | None |
| 500-1000 ft | Twilight Zone | DC 12 | Exhaustion risk, darkvision required | Level 1 |
| 1000-3000 ft | Midnight Zone | DC 15 | Exhaustion, crushing pressure | Level 2 |
| 3000-6000 ft | Abyssal Zone | DC 18 | Rapid exhaustion, madness risk | Level 3 |
| 6000-10000 ft | Hadal Zone | DC 20 | Extreme pressure, reality distortion | Level 4 |

### Crystal Corruption (Aethermoor Crossover)
When crystal plague meets depth adaptation:

### Shadow Integration
Underwater shadows behave differently:

3. **Depth 3000-6000 ft**: Shadows act independently at times
4. **Depth 6000+ ft**: Shadow may separate completely

## Designer Notes
These mechanics create pressure (pun intended) for players to make difficult choices about adaptation. The system rewards gradual acclimation while punishing rapid changes. The social mechanics ensure that becoming adapted has roleplay consequences beyond just statistics.

The interplay between crystal corruption and depth adaptation creates unique character development paths. Players must balance the benefits of adaptation against the loss of their surface identity.

Remember: The mechanics serve the horror of transformation. Use them to enhance the narrative of losing humanity to the depths, not as a punishment system.

## Player-Facing Summary

Aquabyssos Survival Mechanics is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Aquabyssos Survival Mechanics as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Aquabyssos Survival Mechanics.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
