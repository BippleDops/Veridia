# Channel Flame (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (60-yard cone)

**Components**: V, S, M (a burning fire)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes.


## Effects
You stand within 30 feet of mundane flames at least the size of a Large bonfire and channel that fire into a deadly attack. The fire travels through you and becomes a 60-foot cone. All creatures in that cone must make a Dexterity saving through. A creature takes 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Each round, you may change your facing so that you attack a different area.

This spell lasts for 10 minutes, or as long as the fire you are channeling from continues to burn.
