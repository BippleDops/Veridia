# Time's Mercy

## The Phenomenon

**Time's Mercy** is both a metaphysical concept and a literal temporal anomaly that manifests across both [[Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos]] during moments of ultimate moral crisis. It represents the universe itself providing a "second chance" - rewinding crucial moments to allow different choices, but always at a terrible cost to those who invoke it.

### The Divine Mechanism

According to [[Old Valdris]] and other temporal scholars, Time's Mercy operates through the intersection of three cosmic forces:
- **Chronal Compassion**: The universe's inherent tendency toward redemption
- **Sacrificial Resonance**: The willingness of pure souls to pay prices for others
- **Convergence Authority**: The rare moments when both worlds' timelines align

When these forces combine during a moment of ultimate moral weight, reality briefly fractures, allowing for the rewriting of a single crucial decision - but demanding payment in the form of accelerated aging, memory loss, or temporal displacement of the invoker.

## Historical Manifestations

### The Penitent's Hour (Aethermoor, 347 years ago)
When Prince Cassius the Cruel ordered the execution of an entire village for harboring refugees, his court wizard [[Old Valdris]] (then young and idealistic) attempted to invoke Time's Mercy. The temporal rewrite succeeded - the prince's order was never given, the village survived. However, Valdris aged thirty years in thirty seconds and lost all memories of advanced magic, reducing him from archmage to humble village wizard.

### The Captain's Choice (Aquabyssos, 198 years ago)
Captain Nerissa of the Deep Guard faced a choice between saving her trapped crew or preventing a [[Deep Mother]] artifact from escaping containment. Time's Mercy activated when her dying crewmates' combined will resonated with her desperation. She was granted a rewind, allowing her to save both her people and maintain the containment - but she was displaced seven years into her future, emerging to find her loved ones had mourned her death and moved on.

### The Scholar's Paradox (Both Worlds, 23 years ago)
When researcher Tomias accidentally opened a portal between worlds that threatened to destabilize both realities, Time's Mercy manifested simultaneously in both [[Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos]]. The rewind prevented the catastrophic portal opening, but Tomias was scattered across multiple timelines, existing as fragmentary echoes in both worlds - still alive, but never quite fully present in either reality.

## Multiple Perspectives

### The Theological View
*Temple scholars of Aethermoor*

Time's Mercy is divine intervention of the highest order, granted only when a soul demonstrates perfect willingness to sacrifice themselves for others. It is proof that the gods still take active interest in mortal affairs, though they demand appropriate payment for tampering with fate.

### The Academic Understanding  
*Temporal researchers of both worlds*

Time's Mercy represents a natural pressure release valve in the cosmic temporal system. When paradox stress builds to critical levels around a decision of massive moral weight, reality itself "snaps back" to prevent timeline collapse, but the energy cost must be paid by someone.

### The Mystic Interpretation
*Deep current oracles and star-touched seers*

Time's Mercy is the universe learning from its mistakes. Each invocation teaches the cosmos about the true weight of choice and consequence. The price paid by invokers becomes part of the universal wisdom, ensuring future mercies are granted more precisely.

### The Cynical Reality
*Experienced time-travelers and void-touched*

Time's Mercy is a trap. It gives people false hope that their worst mistakes can be undone, but the price is always worse than living with the original consequence. The universe offers "mercy" to collect the souls of those pure enough to sacrifice everything for others.

## The Valdris Documentation

[[Old Valdris]] has spent centuries studying Time's Mercy, driven by guilt over his own invocation and fascination with its mechanisms. His research reveals disturbing patterns:

### The Escalating Cost
Each use of Time's Mercy in a given area makes future invocations more expensive:
- First use: Personal sacrifice (aging, memory loss, displacement)
- Second use: Generational impact (bloodline effects, family displacement)
- Third use: Community consequences (entire regions suffer temporal instability)
- Fourth use: Reality fracturing (permanent changes to local physics)

### The Selection Criteria
Time's Mercy can only be invoked when:
- The decision affects innocent lives on a massive scale
- The invoker is willing to sacrifice their own existence completely
- No other solution exists within normal temporal flow
- The moral weight exceeds a cosmic threshold (measured in "soul debt")

## Current Manifestations

### The Convergence Effect
As [[Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos]] move toward their prophesied convergence, Time's Mercy events are becoming more frequent but more costly. Recent incidents include:

- A merchant who rewound a plague outbreak, aging to death but saving thousands
- A diplomat who prevented a war by taking temporal displacement that scattered her across infinite alternate versions of herself
- A child who saved their village from a [[Deep Mother]] incursion but became temporally unstuck, existing in all ages simultaneously

### The Gathering Storm
[[Old Valdris]] fears the ultimate convergence crisis will trigger a "Time's Mercy cascade" - thousands of people attempting to invoke temporal rewrites simultaneously. His calculations suggest this could:
- Completely unravel the timeline of both worlds
- Create a "mercy singularity" where all choices become simultaneously true
- Attract the attention of entities that exist outside normal time
- Transform the very nature of free will across both realities

## Mechanical Effects

**Mercy's Calling** (Rare Phenomenon)
During critical moral crisis moments, the GM may offer a player the chance to invoke Time's Mercy:
- Allows complete rewind of the last major decision/scene
- Character ages 3d6 years and loses significant memories
- Alternative: Character becomes temporally displaced (exists in multiple timelines)
- Each use in a campaign increases the cost for future invocations

**Temporal Scarring** (Environmental Effect)
Areas where Time's Mercy has been invoked suffer permanent changes:
- Magic functions unpredictably (-2 to spell rolls)
- Time flows at variable rates (sometimes faster, sometimes slower)
- Echoes of prevented events occasionally bleed through
- Sensitive individuals can perceive "ghost timelines" of what was prevented

**Valdris's Wisdom** (Character Knowledge)
Characters who study with [[Old Valdris]] gain:
- Ability to sense when Time's Mercy might be possible
- Knowledge of the true cost before attempting invocation
- Resistance to temporal effects (+2 to saves vs. time magic)
- Terrible burden of knowing how many tragedies could be prevented at extreme cost

## Plot Hooks

### The Mercy Debt
A city's leaders reveal they've been invoking Time's Mercy repeatedly to prevent disasters, but the accumulated cost is about to come due. The PCs must find a way to pay the temporal debt or watch reality collapse around the city.

### The Temporal Refugees
People displaced by Time's Mercy invocations are beginning to congregate in both worlds, creating communities of those "unstuck" from normal time. What happens when they organize and demand their original timelines back?

### The False Mercy
Someone has learned to fake Time's Mercy effects, offering false hope to desperate people while siphoning their life energy. Can the PCs expose the fraud before it triggers a real temporal catastrophe?

### The Mercy Prophet
A prophet claims to have received visions showing when and where Time's Mercy will next manifest. They're gathering "willing sacrifices" to ensure the temporal rewrites benefit their agenda rather than serving genuine mercy.

### The Cascade Prevention
[[Old Valdris]]'s worst fears come true - the convergence crisis begins triggering multiple simultaneous mercy invocations. The PCs must somehow coordinate the temporal rewrites to prevent reality collapse.

### The Mercy War
Two factions in both worlds are fighting over access to sites where Time's Mercy is most likely to manifest, each believing they have the moral right to rewrite history for the greater good.

## The Ultimate Question

As the convergence approaches and Time's Mercy events multiply, a fundamental question emerges: Is the phenomenon truly divine compassion offering redemption, or is it the universe's way of harvesting the purest souls by offering them choices no good person could refuse?

The answer may determine whether the coming crisis offers ultimate salvation or ultimate damnation for both worlds.
