# The Harbor Depths
*Where Surface Meets Abyss, The Drowned Foundation of Port Meridian*

## Overview
The Harbor Depths represent the submerged underbelly of [[Port Meridian]], where the bustling surface port gives way to a treacherous underwater realm. This transition zone between [[Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos]] contains sunken ships, ancient ruins from before the great submersion, and the dangerous meeting point between two very different worlds. Crystal corruption seeps up from below while surface pollutants sink down, creating a unique and hazardous environment.
