# Imbue with Purpose (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, M (1,000 gp worth of pow-dered diamond)

**Duration**: 24 hours


## Effects
One weapon you touch gains the purpose of slaying a particular type of creature (humanoids, monstrosities, undead, etc.) whose alignment is diametrically opposed to yours. For instance, if you are lawful good, you can create a weapon that is purposed to slay evil fey, chaotic fey, or just chaotic evil fey.

When the wielder strikes a creature of that type, one of the following happens:

♦ 100 hit points or more: the creature takes an additional 6d6 force damage and the spell ends.

♦ 50-99 hit points: the creature takes an additional 6d6 force damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is frightened of you for 1 minute.

♦ 49 or fewer hit points: the creature is slain outright.
