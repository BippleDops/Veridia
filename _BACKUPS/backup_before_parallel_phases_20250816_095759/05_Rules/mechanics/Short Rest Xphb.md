--- # Short Rest

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 373. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* A Short Rest is a 1-hour period of downtime, during which a creature does nothing more strenuous than reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. To start a Short Rest, you must have at least 1 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules). ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Benefits of the Rest When you finish the rest, you gain the following benefits: - **Spend Hit Point Dice.** You can spend one or more of your [hit-point-dice-xphb (variant-rules)]] to regain [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules). For each [hit-point-dice-xphb (variant-rules)]] you spend in this way, roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules) equal to the total (minimum of 1 Hit Point). You can decide to spend an additional [hit-point-dice-xphb (variant-rules)]] after each roll. - **Special Feature.** Some features are recharged by a Short Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges in the way specified in its description. ## Interrupting the Rest A Short Rest is stopped by the following interruptions: - Rolling [[Initiative Xphb - Casting a spell other than a cantrip - Taking any damage An interrupted Short Rest confers no benefits. [Dn D5e-Side Screen-2024]] ## Player-Facing Summary Short rest xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of short rest xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around short rest xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Strange disappearances suggest a portal
