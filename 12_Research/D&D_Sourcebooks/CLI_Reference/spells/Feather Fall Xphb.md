# Feather Fall
*1st-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Reaction
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, M (a small feather or piece of down)
- **Duration:** 1 minute

Choose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling creature's rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the spell ends. If a creature lands before the spell ends, the creature takes no damage from the fall, and the spell ends for that creature.
