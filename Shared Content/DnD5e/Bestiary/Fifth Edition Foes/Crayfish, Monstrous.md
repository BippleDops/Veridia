## Ecology

## Description
Monstrous crayfish are freshwater creatures that dwell on the bottoms of seas, lakes, ponds, and other shallow water. They are predators and scavengers that exist on a diet of decaying flesh from dead fish, algae, snails, worms, and other animals, including swimmers who venture too close to the monstrous crayfish’s lair.

These giant crayfish make their homes under rocks or in underwater tunnels that are dug by the crayfish. Their flooded tunnels extend over long distances and always include a “chimney” through which the monstrous crayfish can enter and exit its home via dry ground. These exits have been found as far as 100 feet inland from the lake shore or river bank.

Giant crayfish are often hunted as food by dragon turtles, humans, storm giants, and giant turtles.
