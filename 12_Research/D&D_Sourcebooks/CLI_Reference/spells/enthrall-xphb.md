You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that you can see within range to make a Wisdom saving throw. Any creature you or your companions are fighting automatically succeeds on this save. On a failed save, a target has a -10 penalty to Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) checks and Passive [[skills#Perception|Perception]] until the spell ends.

**Classes**: [[list-spells-classes-warlock|Warlock]]; [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]
