## Description
A novelty cheese popular in Chessenta and the old empires that crouch on the southeastern side of the Sea of Fallen Stars, Lotus Cheese is mixed with flower petals. Roses and honeysuckle are commonly used, but after long experimentation Lotus petals have proved both the most exotic, attractive, and long-lasting of the Chessentan cheeses, and Iâ€™m proud to offer it here. Available in 1 lb torus-shaped wheels (6 sp) and similarly-fashioned wheys (55 gp).
