# Short Rest
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 373. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A Short Rest is a 1-hour period of downtime, during which a creature does nothing more strenuous than reading, talking, eating, or standing watch. To start a Short Rest, you must have at least 1 [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Point]].

## Benefits of the Rest

When you finish the rest, you gain the following benefits:

- **Spend Hit Point Dice.** You can spend one or more of your [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-point-dice-xphb|Hit Point Dice]] to regain [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]]. For each [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-point-dice-xphb|Hit Point Die]] you spend in this way, roll the die and add your Constitution modifier to it. You regain [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] equal to the total (minimum of 1 Hit Point). You can decide to spend an additional [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-point-dice-xphb|Hit Point Die]] after each roll.  
- **Special Feature.** Some features are recharged by a Short Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges in the way specified in its description.  

## Interrupting the Rest

A Short Rest is stopped by the following interruptions:

- Rolling [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/initiative-xphb|Initiative]]  
- Casting a spell other than a cantrip  
- Taking any damage  

An interrupted Short Rest confers no benefits.
