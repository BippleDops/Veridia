# Shadow Broker Mirrors
*The Reflection Syndicate, Masters of Information Mirrors, Those Who See All Faces*

## Overview
The Shadow Broker Mirrors is a specialized information syndicate that uses enchanted mirrors and reflection magic to gather, trade, and manipulate information throughout [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]. Operating from [[The Reflection Chamber]]—a hidden facility lined with thousands of scrying mirrors—they have built the most comprehensive intelligence network in the realm by exploiting the fact that every reflection can become a window into secrets. Unlike traditional spy networks, they use mirror magic to literally see and hear conversations reflected in any polished surface, making privacy nearly impossible for those who don't understand their capabilities.
