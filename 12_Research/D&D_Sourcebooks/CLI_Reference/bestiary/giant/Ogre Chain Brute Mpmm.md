# [[Ogre Chain Brute Mpmm]]
*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 201, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 221*  

An ogre chain brute wields a great spiked chain, swinging it with both hands in a wide circle to knock foes off their feet. Alternatively, the ogre can swing the chain in a crushing overhead smash.

## Ogres of War

Ogres love to rush headlong into battle, but with enough time and patience, some of them learn to carry out specialized missions. The names they are givenâ€”the battering ram, the bolt launcher, the chain brute, and the howdahâ€”reflect their particular functions. These jobs are tailored to take advantage of an ogre's strengths.
