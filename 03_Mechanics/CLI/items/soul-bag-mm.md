# Soul Bag
*Very rare*  



When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a [night hag](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/night-hag-xmm.md)'s Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).
