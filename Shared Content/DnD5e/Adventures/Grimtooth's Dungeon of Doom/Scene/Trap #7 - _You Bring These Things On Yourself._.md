# Trap #7 - "You Bring These Things On Yourself."
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> As the party exits [[Trap #6 - _The Sand Gets In Your Eyes._|Trap#6]] they will find themselves al the head of a stair, 50 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 15 feet tall, leading down.
> 
> The stair is plated'with metal, and the edges of each step are very sharp angles. The stairs are not dangerous if the party steps carefully. This trap is released by any of the steps in the last 10 feet of the stairway. Once pressure is put on any of these surfaces the entire stair is released, and begins at once to act like a giant treadmill. The weight of the delvers will force it down, and their natural instinct will be to back up. This is reinforced by the fact that there is a blank wall at the bottom of the stair and the sharpened stair edges are slipping under it at an ever increasing pace. The moving stair will act like a giant rotary cheese slicer if anyone stops at the bottom and can't climb the wall. Even if they can, what is the alternative to the entire party stacking up at the bottom? The most likely result will be the party attempting to run back up the stair at a pretty good clip. This will buy them some time, but notô€‚­ much as they think.
> 
> As the pace increases the party will begin to notice that the ceiling seems to be getting closer. The stairway/treadmill is attached to a mechanism in the wall that drives a huge gear which in tum lowers the ceiling.
> 
> I rate this puppy at three skulls. There are only good results that can be anticipated here for the aspirant trap master. Either the entire party is thinly sliced for convenient serving, or they are mashed to a pulp by the ceiling. If they by some magical method reach the top they are trapped by the sand, and finally if they somehow jamb the stair the entir emechanism comes toa screeching stop and everyone is dumped in a heap at the bottom of the stairs. (Bruises and bumps at least, broken bones for the unlucky, say a 10% chance (L1).) Keep in mind that the stairs are very sharp and that even average gauge armour plate will be slivered away in thin layers by a large enough blade, (the stair is solid and 10 feet across) driven by multiple delver power, and gravity! The blocking device will have to be formidable in definition. (There are a variety of"indestructible" magical items that will serve well, or a one foot thick block of solid stone or metal .. .right - let's just check the old backpack!)
> 
> The ultimate reward will be to escape by opening the next door, behind the stucco on the wall at the bottom of the stair, probably revealed by the various bashings on the surface caused by the stair trap. It will be the usual three finger hole lock release door. (fhere is a slight difference, there is only one 10 foot tall 5 foot wide panel of the usual double doors, this is so the ceiling lowering mechanism can be fit into the end of the stairway.)
