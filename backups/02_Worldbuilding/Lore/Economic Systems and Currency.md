## Player-Facing Summary

The economic systems spanning Aethermoor and Aquabyssos represent a complex web of currencies, financial institutions, and trading mechanisms that facilitate commerce across two dramatically different realms. Understanding these systems opens opportunities for legitimate business success, criminal profit, political influence, and adventure across multiple economic sectors.

## Lore Details

Ancient texts speak of the first currencies emerging from the depths, where pressure-forged coins were said to contain the memories of the deep-sea gods. Surface dwellers developed crystal-backed money as a response, believing that the magical resonance of crystals could protect wealth from the corrupting influence of the abyss.

Legend holds that the most successful merchants are those who can speak the hidden languages of money - understanding not just exchange rates and profit margins, but the deeper currents of desire, fear, and ambition that truly drive economic systems. Some say that in the deepest vaults of the richest banks, ancient coins still whisper secrets of forgotten civilizations and lost treasures.

## Adventure Hooks

- A mysterious currency is appearing in markets across both realms, apparently minted by a civilization that doesn't officially exist, leading to questions about hidden societies and forgotten kingdoms.
- The party inherits a complex financial instrument that seems to involve obligations to both legitimate institutions and criminal organizations, forcing them to navigate competing loyalties and conflicting interests.
- Economic warfare between realms threatens to escalate into actual military conflict, and the party must work behind the scenes to prevent financial disputes from becoming a shooting war.

## DM Notes

Use the economic systems as a foundation for complex political intrigue, allowing players to engage with power structures through financial means rather than just combat. The multi-layered currency systems provide opportunities for sophisticated plots involving market manipulation, cross-realm politics, and criminal enterprises. Consider how economic events can drive campaign storylines and create consequences that extend far beyond immediate financial gain or loss.

The criminal financial networks offer alternative paths for character development and plot advancement, while the legitimate economic systems provide a framework for understanding how society functions and how player actions might affect broader political and social stability.
