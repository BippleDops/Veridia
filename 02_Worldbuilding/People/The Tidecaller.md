## Special Abilities

**Tidal Empathy.** Marina can communicate telepathically with any creature that has been touched by ocean water in the last 24 hours, regardless of distance, as long as both are in contact with connected bodies of water.

**Storm's Heart.** When Marina casts a spell that deals lightning or thunder damage, she regains hit points equal to the damage dealt (maximum 20 per turn).

**Amphibious.** Marina can breathe air and water.

**Spellcasting.** Marina is a 12th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit). She has the following spells prepared:

**Druid Spells (Circle of Tides):**

## Actions

**Multiattack.** Marina makes two Tidal Strike attacks or casts a spell and makes one attack.

**Tidal Strike.** *Melee Spell Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength save or be pushed 10 feet away.

**Call the Tide (1/Day).** Marina summons a massive wave in a 60-foot line that is 30 feet wide and 15 feet tall. All creatures in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On failure, they take 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage and are swept 30 feet in the wave's direction. On success, half damage and no movement.

**Whirlpool Prison (1/Day).** Marina creates a whirlpool in a 20-foot radius within 120 feet. All creatures in the area must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw each turn or be pulled 10 feet toward the center and take 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage. The whirlpool lasts 5 rounds.

**Current Mastery (3/Day).** Marina redirects the flow of water within 300 feet, creating one of the following effects for 10 minutes:
- **Safe Passage**: Creates a current that grants +20 feet swimming speed to allies
- **Barrier Current**: Creates a wall of moving water that blocks ranged attacks
- **Undertow**: Difficult terrain that pulls enemies toward a specific point

## Description

Marina Currentborn embodies the fluid grace and untamed power of the ocean itself. Her sea elf heritage is evident in her tall, willowy frame and the subtle blue-green tint to her silver hair that flows like water even when she's still. Standing 5'11" with an athlete's build honed by years swimming in the strongest currents, she moves with the rhythmic sway of tide and wave.

Her most distinctive features are her eyes, which shift color with her emotions and the tides—from deep ocean blue during calm periods to storm-gray when angry, and silver-white when channeling her most powerful magic. Intricate tattoos resembling flowing water spiral up her arms and across her shoulders, and these living marks actually move and pulse with the rhythm of nearby currents.

Marina wears robes woven from kelp and sea silk that never seem to dry completely, always carrying the scent and movement of the ocean. Around her neck hangs the Tidal Heart, a crystal that pulses in sync with the ocean's rhythms and serves as her primary focus for current manipulation.

She dwells at Current Confluence, where seven major ocean currents meet and form a natural amphitheater of swirling water. Here, she serves as both guardian and guide, helping ships navigate the treacherous waters while protecting the delicate balance that keeps the currents flowing properly.

## Equipment

- **Staff of the Seven Currents** (controls water within 1 mile, never wet)
- **Tidal Heart Crystal** (enhances water-based magic, predicts weather)
- **Robes of the Flowing Deep** (+2 AC, water breathing for others)
- **Current Map** (living chart that shows real-time ocean conditions)
- **Shell of Summoning** (calls dolphins, whales, or water elementals)
- **Pearl of Pressure** (allows survival at any ocean depth)

## Relationships

**Allies:**
- **[[The Tidal Council]]** - Her primary faction of ocean protectors and current-masters
- **[[Harbor Master Luna Freedrift]]** - Coordinates shipping routes through Marina's currents
- **Marine Life Coalition** - Whales, dolphins, and sea creatures that serve as her informants
- **Weather Witches Coven** - Fellow practitioners who work with atmospheric currents

**Enemies:**
- **[[The Pressure Pirates]]** - They disrupt her carefully maintained current systems
- **Current Poachers** - Those who steal tidal energy for illegal magical purposes
- **Storm Slavers** - Pirates who capture and sell weather spirits
- **The Stagnant Cult** - Fanatics who believe all water should be still and lifeless

**Complicated:**
- **[[Captain Nautilus the Deep Wanderer]]** - Appreciates her help but resents her control over his sailing routes
- **[[The Biomancers]]** - She provides specimens from deep currents but opposes their more extreme experiments
- **The Deep Current Entity** - A mysterious intelligence in the deepest ocean streams that she's not sure is benevolent

## Quest Hooks

1. **The Dying Currents** - Marina's carefully maintained current system is breaking down due to an unknown force. Without it, shipping will collapse and marine ecosystems will die. She needs investigators to find the cause.

2. **The Storm Thief** - Someone is stealing weather patterns and storing them in magical containers, disrupting Marina's ability to predict and control oceanic conditions. The thefts are getting larger and more dangerous.

3. **The Deep Current War** - Two ancient entities that control deep ocean currents are fighting, and their battle is affecting surface weather worldwide. Marina needs powerful allies to mediate before the conflict destroys both realms.

4. **The Tidal Prophecy** - Marina has received visions of a great tsunami that will devastate both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor unless she can find and activate seven ancient tidal control stones scattered across both realms.

5. **The Current Map Heist** - Marina's living current map has been stolen by forces unknown. Without it, she's essentially blind to ocean conditions, making her unable to protect ships or maintain the current system.

## Secrets

- **The Binding Ritual**: Marina's power comes from a ritual that bound her life force to the ocean's currents. If the major currents fail, she will die with them.
- **The Deep Voice**: The entity she communes with in the deepest currents may not be a natural ocean spirit but something far more alien and potentially dangerous.
- **The First Storm**: Her powers awakened during a catastrophic hurricane that killed her entire village. She sometimes wonders if she caused it rather than survived it.
- **The Current Thieves**: She knows that several major shipping companies are secretly siphoning current energy to power magical engines, but proving it would crash the economy.
- **The Ultimate Tide**: Marina has discovered how to create a tide so massive it could flood both surface and underwater cities, but the knowledge terrifies her.

## Motivations

**Primary**: Maintain the balance of ocean currents that sustains life in both realms
**Secondary**: Protect marine ecosystems and the creatures that depend on healthy currents
**Hidden**: Discover the true nature of the deep current entity and whether it can be trusted

## Roleplaying Notes

**Personality**: Fluid and adaptable like water itself, but can become overwhelming and destructive when opposed. Speaks in metaphors drawn from ocean phenomena.

**Ideals**: "Water always finds its way, flowing around obstacles or wearing them down over time. The ocean connects all things—respect that connection."

**Bonds**: "Every drop of water in the ocean carries the memory of every shore it has touched. I am the keeper of those memories and the guardian of those connections."

**Flaws**: "I can be as relentless and destructive as a tsunami when I believe I'm right. My connection to the ocean makes me impatient with those who think in terms of land-based limitations."

**Voice**: Her voice has the rhythmic quality of waves lapping against shore, rising and falling like the tide. When angry, it carries the rumble of distant thunder.

**Speaking Patterns**: 
- "The currents whisper of changes coming..."
- "Like water against stone, persistence overcomes all obstacles..."
- "The tide turns for no one, but wise sailors learn to ride it..."
- "In the deep places, we find truths that surface dwellers never see..."

**Mannerisms**: Always seems to be in motion, swaying gently even when standing still. She traces current patterns in the air when thinking deeply, and water nearby begins to move in sympathy with her emotions. She collects shells and sea glass, claiming each one contains a current's memory.
