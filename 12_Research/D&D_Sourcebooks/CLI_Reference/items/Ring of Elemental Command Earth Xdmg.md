# Ring of Elemental Command (Earth)
*Ring, legendary (requires attunement)*  



The Ring of Elemental Command (earth) is linked to the Elemental Plane of Earth. Every Ring of Elemental Command has the following two properties:

- **Elemental Bane.** While wearing the ring, you have [[advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on attack rolls against Elementals and they have [[disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on attack rolls against you.  
- **Elemental Compulsion.** While wearing the ring, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to try to compel an Elemental you see within 60 feet of yourself. The Elemental makes a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the Elemental has the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] condition until the start your next turn, and you determine what it does with its move and action on its next turn.  

## Elemental Focus

While wearing the ring, you benefit from additional properties corresponding to the ring's linked Elemental Plane:

- **Earth.** You know Terran, and you have [[resistance-xphb|Resistance]] to Acid damage. Terrain composed of rubble, rocks, or dirt isn't [[difficult-terrain-xphb|Difficult Terrain]] for you. In addition, you can move through solid earth or rock as if those areas were [[difficult-terrain-xphb|Difficult Terrain]] without disturbing the matter through which you pass. If you end your turn in solid earth or rock, you are shunted out to the nearest unoccupied space you last occupied.  

## Spellcasting

The ring has 5 charges and regains `1d4 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can cast a spell from it. A spell cast from the ring has a save DC of 18. Choose the spell from the following list: [[earthquake-xphb|Earthquake]] (5 charges), [[stone-shape-xphb|Stone Shape]] (2 charges), [[stoneskin-xphb|Stoneskin]] (3 charges), [[wall-of-stone-xphb|Wall of Stone]] (3 charges)
