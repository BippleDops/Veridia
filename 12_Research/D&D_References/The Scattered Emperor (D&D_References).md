## Distributed Consciousness of Abyssos Prime

> *"Weâ€”welcomeâ€”you butâ€”trust nothingâ€”that castsâ€”shadows."*

### Current Form
The Emperor exists as approximately 10,000 fragments of consciousness distributed across sea life within a 10-mile radius of Abyssos Prime. His primary manifestation is through a school of electric eels that swim through the air in the [[Throne of Bubbles]], each eel containing a different aspect of his personality, memories, or emotions.

### Original Appearance (Historical)
Before the fragmentation, Malachus was a tall, imperious figure with silver hair that moved like water and eyes that held the depth of trenches. Portraits show him wearing robes that seemed to be cut from the ocean itself.

### Before the Cataclysm
Malachus was the greatest mage-emperor in history, ruling the surface empire of Thalassopolis. His mastery of the Deep Currentsâ€”primordial magical flowsâ€”was unmatched. He discovered that drowning was not death but transformation, a gateway to immortality.

### The Intentional Cataclysm
**The Dark Truth:** Malachus caused the Cascade of Sorrows intentionally, believing that drowning the world would grant everyone immortality. He saw it not as genocide but as forced evolution. The plan partially workedâ€”he achieved immortality, but not as intended.

### The Fragmentation
When shadows began gaining independence 50 years ago, Malachus realized that a single consciousness could be replaced. In paranoid brilliance, he shattered his mind across thousands of creatures, making shadow replacement impossible. No shadow can replace what has no single form.

### Major Aspects (In Different Eels)
1. **The Paranoid:** Suspects everyone of betrayal
2. **The Nostalgic:** Remembers the surface world fondly
3. **The Furious:** Rages against the current state
4. **The Calculator:** Processes probability and strategy
5. **The Sorrowful:** Mourns what was lost
6. **The Ambitious:** Still plans to rule all reality
7. **The Mad:** Speaks in paradoxes and impossibilities
8. **The Wise:** Retains magical knowledge
9. **The Child:** Innocent and curious
10. **The Dying:** Aware of eventual dissolution

### The Fragment Wars
Different consciousness fragments have different relationships:
- Paranoid fragments trust no one
- Nostalgic fragments favor surface dwellers
- Mad fragments ally with chaos
- Calculating fragments play all sides

### What He Knows
1. **Shadow Replacements:** Identity of every replaced official
2. **The Harvest:** Full plan and timeline
3. **The Deep Mother:** What lies beneath Aquabyssos
4. **Cure for Shadows:** How to permanently destroy them
5. **The True Cataclysm:** Why he really drowned the world
6. **Surface Paths:** Secret routes to the surface
7. **The Seventh Shard:** Its location and purpose

### Conditions for Reunification
1. Extreme threat to Abyssos Prime
2. Uimous agreement of major fragments
3. Presence of someone he trusts absolutely
4. Magical circle to contain consciousness
5. Acceptance of death as consequence

### The Emperor's Requests (Different Fragments)
1. **Paranoid:** Spy on the Parliament
2. **Nostalgic:** Bring surface artifacts
3. **Furious:** Assassinate shadow replacements
4. **Calculator:** Gather probability data
5. **Sorrowful:** Find his original body
6. **Ambitious:** Claim the Deep Currents
7. **Mad:** Dance with shadows at midnight
8. **Wise:** Recover lost spell components
9. **Child:** Play games of riddles
10. **Dying:** Prepare his funeral

### Communication Methods
1. **Eel Chorus:** Multiple eels speak in sequence
2. **Electric Patterns:** Messages in lightning displays
3. **Creature Swarms:** Spelling words with fish schools
4. **Dream Fragments:** Each fragment sends different dreams
5. **Environmental Manipulation:** Using palace features

### Typical Conversation Flow
```
Eel 1: "Weâ€”"
Eel 2: "â€”no, they can't be trustedâ€”"
Eel 3: "â€”welcome youâ€”"
Eel 4: "â€”it's a trapâ€”"
Eel 5: "â€”but trustâ€”"
Eel 6: "â€”KILL THEM ALLâ€”"
Eel 7: "â€”nothing thatâ€”"
Eel 8: "â€”mother, is that you?â€”"
Eel 9: "â€”casts shadows."
Eel 10: "â€”the probability of success isâ€”"

### The Emperor's End Game
1. **If party gains trust:** May reunify to help them
2. **If party threatens:** Fragments scatter further
3. **If ignored:** Slowly degrades into chaos
4. **If united with cure:** Could return to single form
5. **Ultimate sacrifice:** Reunify to stop the Harvest

### The Real Reason (Ultra Secret)
Malachus discovered that reality itself was dyingâ€”entropy would claim everything in 1,000 years. The only escape was to transform reality into something that could survive: a world of consciousness without fixed form. The drowning was meant to "liquify" reality itself, making it mutable and eternal.

He partially succeeded. Aquabyssos exists in a state between real and unreal, which is why:
- Time flows differently
- Shadows gain independence
- Memory becomes physical
- Death isn't permanent
- Consciousness can be distributed

### Fragment Personalities (d10)
1. Paranoid - "It's a trap!"
2. Nostalgic - "Like the surface..."
3. Furious - "KILL THEM ALL!"
4. Calculator - "Probability suggests..."
5. Sorrowful - "All is lost..."
6. Ambitious - "We shall rule!"
7. Mad - "Fish fly, birds swim!"
8. Wise - "The Deep Currents know..."
9. Child - "Want to play?"
10. Dying - "Not much time..."

### Key Phrases by Fragment
- **Paranoid:** "Trust nothing, especially yourself"
- **Calculator:** "In 7,293 timelines, you're already dead"
- **Mad:** "We are one, we are none, we are done"
- **Wise:** "The depths remember what the surface forgets"
- **Dying:** "Unity is death, but death may be necessary"
