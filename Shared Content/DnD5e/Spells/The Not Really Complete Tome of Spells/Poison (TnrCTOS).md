# Poison (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
You dose a creature you touch with an extremely potent toxin. The creature is poisoned for 1 day and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the creature is unaffected. On a failure, the creature takes 1d6 poison damage every hour for 24 hours, and its hit point total is reduced by that amount. If the creature’s hit point total is reduced to 0 by this effect, the creature dies. The creature’s hit point maximum will be restored once it is no longer poisoned and has taken a long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with an 8th-level or higher spell slot, the poison does 1d10 damage every hour.
