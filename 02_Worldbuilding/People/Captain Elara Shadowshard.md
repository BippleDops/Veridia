# Captain Elara Shadowshard
*Shadow-Touched Mercenary, Seeker of the Obsidian Shard*

## Overview
Captain Elara Shadowshard leads the Shadow Company, a mercenary band that specializes in operations within [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Shadowmere]]. Five years ago, she was exposed to emanations from the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards|Obsidian Shard]] during a failed expedition. The experience changed herâ€”she can now see in absolute darkness and communicate with shadow creatures, but suffers from an insatiable hunger to possess the Shard that touched her.

## Description
- **Appearance**: Lean, athletic build with unnaturally pale skin and eyes that reflect light like a cat's
- **Shadow Mark**: Black veins visible beneath her skin, most prominent on her hands and neck
- **Equipment**: Wields twin scimitars that seem to absorb light, wears armor that blends with shadows
- **Personality**: Pragmatic, confident, increasingly obsessed with returning to the Shadowmere

## Background
### Before the Shadowmere
- Former officer in the Royal Navy
- Led expeditions into dangerous territories
- Known for bringing her crews home alive
- Respected for tactical brilliance and loyalty

### The Shadowmere Expedition
- Hired by [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Zephyr Goldwhisper]] to investigate "anomalous readings"
- Lost half her crew to shadow creatures and corruption
- Discovered the Obsidian Shard's approximate location
- Exposed to Shard's influence, barely escaped alive
- Changed by the experience, resigned from Navy

### The Shadow Company
- Founded mercenary band specializing in Shadowmere operations
- Recruits shadow-touched individuals and survivors
- Takes contracts others won't: shadow realms, cursed places, impossible rescues
- Slowly planning return to claim the Obsidian Shard

## Shadow-Touched Abilities
- **Darkvision**: Can see perfectly in magical darkness
- **Shadow Step**: Short-range teleportation through shadows
- **Shadow Whispers**: Can communicate with lesser shadow creatures
- **Fear Immunity**: Unaffected by supernatural fear effects

- **"Whisper" Marcus**: Scout, can become incorporeal briefly
- **Dr. Helena Voidwalker**: Medic, studies shadow corruption effects
- **Sergeant Iron Will**: Only non-corrupted member, keeps others grounded

### Operations

## Current Situation
### The Growing Hunger
- Obsession with Obsidian Shard intensifies monthly
- Suffers nightmares when away from shadow-touched areas

- Considers increasingly dangerous plans to reach the Shard

### Faction Interests
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Silverscale Consortium]]**: Wants to hire her for Shard location
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/High Inquisitor Maltheos]]**: Views her as corruption that must be cleansed
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]]**: Potential ally or rival in shadow magic
- **[[Order of the Shattered Crown]]**: Seeks her knowledge of Shard locations

## Moral Complexity
### The Corruption Dilemma
