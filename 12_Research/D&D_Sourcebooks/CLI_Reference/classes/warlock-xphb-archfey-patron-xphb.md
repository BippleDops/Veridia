## Class Features

### Archfey Patron (Level 3)

*Bargain with Whimsical Fey*

Your pact draws on the power of the Feywild. When you choose this subclass, you might make a deal with an archfey, such as the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and [[darkness-xphb|Darkness]], ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; or an ancient hag. Or you might call on a spectrum of Fey, weaving a web of favors and debts. Whoever they are, your patron is often inscrutable and whimsical.

### Archfey Spells (Level 3)

The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Archfey Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

**Archfey Spells**

| Warlock Level | Spells |
|---------------|--------|
| 3 | [[calm-emotions-xphb|Calm Emotions]], [[faerie-fire-xphb|Faerie Fire]], [[misty-step-xphb|Misty Step]], [[phantasmal-force-xphb|Phantasmal Force]], [[sleep-xphb|Sleep]] |
| 5 | [[blink-xphb|Blink]], [[plant-growth-xphb|Plant Growth]] |
| 7 | [[dominate-beast-xphb|Dominate Beast]], [[greater-invisibility-xphb|Greater Invisibility]] |
| 9 | [[dominate-person-xphb|Dominate Person]], [[seeming-xphb|Seeming]] |
^archfey-spells

### Steps of the Fey (Level 3)

Your patron grants you the ability to move between the boundaries of the planes. You can cast [[misty-step-xphb|Misty Step]] without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]].

In addition, whenever you cast that spell, you can choose one of the following additional effects.

#### Refreshing Step

Immediately after you teleport, you or one creature you can see within 10 feet of yourself gains `d10` [[temporary-hit-points-xphb|Temporary Hit Points]].

#### Taunting Step

Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or have [[disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn.

### Misty Escape (Level 6)

You can cast [[misty-step-xphb|Misty Step]] as a [[reaction-xphb|Reaction]] in response to taking damage.

In addition, the following effects are now among your Steps of the Fey options.

#### Disappearing Step

You have the [[conditions#Invisible|Invisible]] condition until the start of your next turn or until immediately after you make an attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell.

#### Dreadful Step

Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left or the space you appear in (your choice) must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or take `2d10` Psychic damage.

### Beguiling Defenses (Level 10)

Your patron teaches you how to guard your mind and body. You are immune to the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] condition.

In addition, immediately after a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a [[reaction-xphb|Reaction]] to reduce the damage you take by half (round down), and you can force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes Psychic damage equal to the damage you take. Once you use this [[reaction-xphb|Reaction]], you can't use it again until you finish a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]] unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it.

### Bewitching Magic (Level 14)

Your patron grants you the ability to weave your magic with teleportation. Immediately after you cast an Enchantment or Illusion spell using an action and a spell slot, you can cast [[misty-step-xphb|Misty Step]] as part of the same action and without expending a spell slot.
