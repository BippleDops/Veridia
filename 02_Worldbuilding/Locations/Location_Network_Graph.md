## Notes
- Travel time is expressed in days by default; underwater routes may use pressure-lock segments.
- Realm-shift points are rare; consuming a charge from a shard or meeting ritual requirements may be necessary.
- Resource availability fluctuates with the Living Economy; see [[Living_Economy_System.md]].
