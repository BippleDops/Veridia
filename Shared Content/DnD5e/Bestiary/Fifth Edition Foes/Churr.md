## Description
Churrs are savage, apelike creatures that dwell in warm, heavily forested areas. They are reasonably intelligent; some churrs are known to use primitive clubs or even to fashion spears with which to hunt. A typical adult churr stands 8 feet tall and has arms that are nearly as long as its body.

In rare instances, stone-age tribes have been known to adopt churrs as guardians. The creatures take to sign language readily. Among themselves, they speak a debased, pidgin form of Giant. They can learn to understand Common but they seem unable to speak more than the simplest words, and even those come out with a thick, guttural accent that takes practice to understand.

Churr can interbreed with some humanoid and most ape species, making them a “missing link” or bridge species. Mixed progeny are usually smaller but more intelligent than a typical churr, and they have an easier time learning and speaking Common and other languages.

Evil bands of churr are known to kidnap humanoids to keep as slaves— until such time as the slave inadvertently enrages a churr and is killed and eaten on the spot. Churr begin combat by unleashing their horrific howl and beating their chests. They then charge opponents, attempting to get their meaty paws around them and choke or smash the life from them.

Churrs congregate in small bands or packs of less than 20 individuals. Males dominate the pack and females are tasked with menial chores, childbearing, and raising the young. Usually the strongest and most powerful churr becomes the leader. Fights to the death are not uncommon when a leader dies, as ambitious replacements vie for the open command. Churrs are omnivorous. They hunt small game as well as gathering fruits and vegetables in season.
