*The Guardians of Aquabyssos* > *"We are the pressure that maintains balance, the current that carries justice to every depth. We stand watch over the realm not as conquerors but as servants—servants of the law, servants of the people, servants of the depths themselves. Where darkness threatens to overwhelm light, where chaos would drown order, there you will find the Depth Wardens holding the line."*

> — [[Commander Drake Pressureborn|02 Worldbuilding/People/Commander Drake Pressureborn, Supreme Commander of the Depth Wardens ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview The Depth Wardens are the primary law enforcement and security organization of [Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], serving as both police force and military organization responsible for maintaining order throughout the vast underwater realm. Founded over eight centuries ago during the consolidation of Aquabyssos under [[Emperor Thalassius the Wise|02 Worldbuilding/People/Emperor Thalassius The Wise, the Depth Wardens have evolved from a simple guard force into a sophisticated organization capable of handling everything from routine criminal investigations to existential threats to the realm. What distinguishes the Depth Wardens from conventional law enforcement is their unique adaptation to the three-dimensional nature of underwater society and the extreme environmental challenges of operating across massive depth ranges. Every Depth Warden undergoes intensive training in pressure adaptation, underwater combat, deep-sea survival, and the specialized skills required to maintain order in a society that exists in multiple depth zones with radically different environmental conditions. The organization operates under a dual mandate: maintaining civil order and protecting the realm from external threats. This means Depth Wardens serve simultaneously as local police officers, criminal investigators, emergency responders, border guards, and military defenders. Their broad authority and diverse responsibilities make them one of the most visible and influential institutions in Aquabyssos society. The Depth Wardens maintain their headquarters in [Abyssos Prime|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Abyssos Prime]], with major regional commands throughout the realm and smaller stations in settlements across all depth zones. They coordinate closely with [[The Royal Palace|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Royal Palace on security policy and maintain significant operations at [Port Meridian Harbor|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian Harbor]] to oversee maritime security. Their organizational structure combines military discipline with civilian law enforcement flexibility, allowing them to adapt to situations ranging from minor civil disputes to major threats against the realm itself. ### Command Structure **Supreme Commander** (1):
