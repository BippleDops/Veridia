*Adventuring gear, poison (ingested)* - **Properties**: [[item properties#Poison|Poison
- **Cost**: 1,500 gp A creature that ingests Midnight Tears suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. Any effect that ends the [conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition neutralizes this poison. If the poison hasn't been neutralized before midnight, the creature makes a **DC 17** Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (``dice: 9d6``) Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 91.
