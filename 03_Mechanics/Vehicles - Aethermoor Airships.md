# Aethermoor Airships

Crystal-powered vessels that ride currents, gravity folds, and starlight. Integrates [[Complete Reality Merger System]], [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]], [[Complete Faction Warfare System]], [[Memory Trading Economy System|Memory Trading Economy]], [[Complete Pressure Adaptation System]] (altitude inversion), and [[Deep Mother]].

## Crystal-Powered Airships (Examples)
- Harmonium Skiff (Resonant levitation; silent running)
- Wind-Sung Clipper (Sails on songs; bard-boosted speed)
- Void-Touched Corsair (Gravity-null pods; sanity risks)
- Nimbus Garden (Living cloud hull; weather control)
- Star-Anchored Platform (Orbital relay; anchor array)
- Fold-Gate Courier (Short-range reality folds; mishap risk)
- Zephyr Pike (Ramming prow; pressure inversion on impact)
- Choir of Glass (Crystal choir drives; shatter risk)
- Thunder Sloop (Storm battery; lightning lances)
- Aurora Ark (Light-bend stealth; prism shields)
- Sky Loom (Weaves jet streams; path editor)
- Gravity Well Dreadnought (Controls descent/ascent fields)
- Gale Harrier (Interception specialist)
- Halo Monastery (Shrine-ship; mass sanity buffer)
- Whisper Kite (Scout; hears memory winds)

GM Note: Expand to 50+ designs via template [[05_Templates/Vehicles/New_Ship_Template|New Ship Template]].

## Aerial Combat Mechanics
- 3D Grid: Altitude bands; stall checks when overburdened or de-powered
- Crystal Resonance Arrays: Select frequency for damage/control; mis-tune causes feedback
- Gravity Manipulation: Spend POU to alter local gravity; risky near merger zones
- Sky Piracy: Boarding grapnels, anchor jammers, wind shear traps

## Integration Hooks
- Altitude Pressure Inversion: Apply pressure rules inverted for height (see [[Depth Survival Mechanics]])
- Sanity: Prolonged void-sight requires [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]] saves; shrine-chant stabilizes
- Reality: Fold-Gate Couriers create micro-mergers; anchors mitigate
- Memory: Whisper Kites harvest route echoes; charts fuel long-haul jumps
- Faction: Doctrines yield preferred altitude bands and weapon arrays (see [[Fleet_Dynamics_Generator|Fleet Dynamics Generator]])

## Example Stat Block: Wind-Sung Clipper (Medium Frigate)
- Hull 140 (Segments 4×35) • AC 15 crystal-rig • Speed 80 kn air • Maneuver 3/round
- Crew 10/18/30 (Captain, Helms, Engineer×2, Sensor, Gunnery×2, Rigger×3, Anchorite)
- Power POU 7 (Crystal 5, Memory 2)
- RSB +2 • Sanity Threshold 14 • Anchors 1 • Upgrade Slots Bio 1 / Crystal 3 / Pressure 1 / Memory 1 / Shrine 1
- Specials: Songride (+20 kn while bard performs), Prism Dive (vertical speed boost; Con saves on crew)

## Player-Facing Summary

Aethermoor Airships is a sky-borne element of the setting, known for brass fittings and cloudstone terraces. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Aethermoor Airships as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Aethermoor Airships.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Aethermoor Airships to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at Aethermoor Airships to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to Aethermoor Airships active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
