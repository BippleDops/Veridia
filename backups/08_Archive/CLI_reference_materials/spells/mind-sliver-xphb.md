*cantrip, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action

You try to temporarily sliver the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or take `d6` Psychic damage and subtract `d4` from the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by `d6` when you reach levels 5 (`2d6`), 11 (`3d6`), and 17 (`4d6`).
