# The Missing Diplomat

*"When diplomats vanish, wars often follow."*

## Overview
A critical political investigation where Ambassador Nereon Peacekeeper, Aquabyssos's chief diplomat to the surface kingdoms, has disappeared during sensitive treaty negotiations. His vanishing threatens to destabilize fragile peace talks and potentially trigger international conflict.

Time is running out as both sides grow suspicious, and without resolution, years of diplomatic progress could be lost.

## The Situation
**Missing Person**: Ambassador Nereon Peacekeeper, age 45, experienced diplomat
**Last Seen**: Private meeting with surface world trade representatives
**Timeline**: Missing for 72 hours with no communication
**Stakes**: Critical trade agreement worth millions in commerce
**Political Impact**: Both sides beginning to suspect foul play

## Investigation Leads
**Last Known Activities**: Meeting with Trade Minister Goldwater and two surface representatives
**Personal Effects**: Diplomatic case missing, but formal robes left in hotel room
**Witnesses**: Hotel staff report strange visitors asking about the ambassador
**Financial Records**: Large sum withdrawn from diplomatic account day before disappearance
**Communications**: Encrypted message sent to unknown recipient hours before vanishing

## Key NPCs
**Trade Minister Sarah Goldwater**: Last person to see ambassador officially
**Surface Representative Captain Marcus**: Claims meeting ended normally
**Hotel Concierge Philip**: Noticed suspicious individuals near ambassador's room
**Security Chief Marina**: Leading official investigation with limited resources
**Underground Contact "Whisper"**: May have information about unofficial activities

## Possible Theories
**Kidnapping**: Enemy agents captured him to sabotage negotiations
**Assassination**: Killed by extremists opposed to surface world relations
**Defection**: Voluntarily disappeared with classified information or funds
**Protection**: Hiding after discovering assassination plot against him
**Personal Crisis**: Family emergency forced immediate departure

## Investigation Methods
- Interview all parties who met with ambassador
- Search hotel room and meeting locations for clues
- Track financial transactions and communications
- Investigate underground intelligence networks
- Question political opponents of the peace process

## Political Complications
- Surface world delegation growing impatient and suspicious
- Aquabyssos hardliners claiming this proves surface world treachery
- Media speculation creating public pressure for answers
- Other diplomatic missions questioning their safety
- Trade partners reconsidering agreements without treaty clarity

## Time Pressure
**72 Hours**: Surface delegation threatens to leave without resolution
**1 Week**: Trade agreement expires without ambassador's signature
**2 Weeks**: Political opposition may call for investigation of entire diplomatic corps
**1 Month**: International reputation damage becomes permanent

## The Truth (DM Options)
**Option A**: Ambassador discovered assassination plot and went into hiding
**Option B**: Kidnapped by extremist faction trying to prevent peace
**Option C**: Voluntarily disappeared after discovering corruption in negotiations
**Option D**: Surface world double agent trying to steal diplomatic secrets
**Option E**: Personal blackmail forcing him to cooperate with criminal elements

## Evidence and Clues
- Coded diplomatic communications requiring interpretation
- Financial irregularities in embassy accounts
- Witness testimonies with conflicting details
- Physical evidence from hotel and meeting rooms
- Intelligence reports about threats against diplomatic personnel

## Resolution Paths
**Rescue Mission**: Locate and extract ambassador from captors
**Diplomatic Solution**: Negotiate release through proper channels
**Investigation**: Expose conspiracy and clear ambassador's name
**Cover-up**: Manage political fallout while continuing private search
**Replacement**: Find qualified substitute to continue negotiations

## Rewards and Consequences
**Success**: Prevent diplomatic crisis, maintain peace process, gain political favor
**Partial Success**: Find ambassador but damage already done to negotiations
**Failure**: International incident, trade war, or actual military conflict
**Experience**: 3,000-5,000 XP depending on resolution method and speed

## Adventure Hooks

2. Surface world contacts request discrete assistance
3. Family member asks for help finding missing relative
4. Intelligence suggests characters might be next targets
