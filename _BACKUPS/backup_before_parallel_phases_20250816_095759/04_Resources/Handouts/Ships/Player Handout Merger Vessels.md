# Merger Vessels — What Impossible Looks Like

- Time Skipper: Deck clocks run backwards; wake arrives before hull.
- Dream Barge: Velvet shadows pool; lullabies steer better than wheels.
- Probability Sloop: Dice altars on the bridge; odds etched into rails.
- Paradox Dreadnought: Staircases that disagree; cannons that un-fire.
- Möbius Ferry: Corridor returns you to yourself; cargo that is you.

These ships demand anchors, charts, and strong minds. Read [[Merger Hybrid Vehicles and [Aquabyssos]].
