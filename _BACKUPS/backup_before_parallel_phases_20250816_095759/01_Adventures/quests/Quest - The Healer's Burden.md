- **Name**: Local authority figure
- **Location**: Town center
- **Motivation**: Community safety ## Objectives

- Secondary objectives
- Hidden goals ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Quest Overview **Level**: 5-9 **Duration**: 3-5 sessions **Type**: Medical Ethics Drama **Key Themes**: Medical triage, resource scarcity, professional duty, moral injury ## Player-Facing Summary High Priestess and Dr. Celeste Dawnbringer faces an impossible situation when a plague outbreak overwhelms her healing abilities. With limited supplies for only 40% of the infected, she must establish triage protocols that will determine who lives and who dies. The party becomes involved when their own moral choices intersect with hers. ## Lore Details Dr. Celeste Dawnbringer has served the Harbor District for fifteen years, treating everyone from dock workers to merchant princes with equal dedication. When shadow plague strikes during the height of trading season, over 300 people fall ill simultaneously. Her medical supplies, carefully rationed for normal circumstances, can treat fewer than half. For the first time in her career, she must choose who to save - and who to let die. The crisis deepens when different groups pressure her for priority treatment: wealthy families offer enormous payments, political leaders demand preference for "essential workers," families plead for their children, and fellow healers debate the ethics of different triage systems. Each choice she makes saves some lives while condemning others. ## The Central Dilemma Dr. Dawnbringer approaches the party for guidance on establishing triage protocols. She presents five competing systems, each with moral justifications and devastating consequences: ### Triage Options 1. **First Come, First Served** - **Principle**: Fairness through temporal priority - **Problems**: Favors those who can reach help quickly, ignores medical urgency - **Supporters**: Working-class families, egalitarian philosophers 2. **Greatest Medical Need** - **Principle**: Treat the sickest patients first - **Problems**: Uses resources on patients least likely to survive - **Supporters**: Traditional medical ethics, patient advocacy groups 3. **Best Survival Chance** - **Principle**: Maximize lives saved through resource efficiency - **Problems**: Abandons the most vulnerable, utilitarian calculation of human worth - **Supporters**: Public health officials, resource managers 4. **Social Value Assessment** - **Principle**: Prioritize those most important to community function - **Problems**: Creates hierarchy of human worth, systematic discrimination - **Supporters**: Government officials, business leaders 5. **Random Selection** - **Principle**: Equal chance for all through lottery system - **Problems**: Ignores medical factors, may select poor candidates - **Supporters**: Ethicists, religious leaders emphasizing divine will ### The Impossible Patients **Elder Marcus Coralwise**

- **Medical**: Advanced plague, 20% survival chance, requires extensive resources
- **Social Value**: Provides crucial leadership during crisis, irreplaceable knowledge
- **Family**: Grown children advocating for treatment, grandchildren dependent on him **Child Lily Brightwater**
- **Status**: 8-year-old orphan, ward of local temple
- **Medical**: Early-stage plague, 85% survival chance with treatment

- **Status**: Teenage siblings, both infected, limited resources for both
- **Medical**: One twin has better survival chances than the other
- **Social Value**: No special community roles
- **Family**: Parents demand both be treated equally or neither treated at all ### The Bribery Attempts

Wealthy merchant families offer Dr. Dawnbringer payments ranging from 5,000 to 20,000 gold pieces for priority treatment. The money could purchase additional supplies, potentially saving more lives overall - but accepting creates systematic inequality. ### The Political Pressure

City officials demand that "essential workers" receive priority, threatening to remove Dr. Dawnbringer's medical license if she doesn't comply. They argue community survival depends on maintaining crucial services. ### The Religious Conflict

Various religious groups offer competing theological frameworks:
- **Temple of Healing**: All life is sacred, treat by greatest need
- **Order of Natural Cycles**: Death is natural, don't interfere with fate
- **Church of Community**: Priority to those who serve others
- **Cult of Individual Worth**: Each person's value is equal, use random selection ### The Time Pressure

New patients arrive every few hours. Each delay in establishing triage protocols means people die who could saveded. Dr. Dawnbringer cannot deliberate indefinitely while patients suffer. ### Investigation Phase

Players can research different triage systems, interview stakeholders, and examine individual patient cases. Information gathered affects the moral weight of later decisions. ### Decision Phase

Players help Dr. Dawnbringer choose a triage system. Their choice determines which patients live or die, affecting their relationships with NPCs and the community. ### Implementation Phase

Players witness the results of their decision, including:
- Emotional reactions from families of saved and unsaved patients
- Community divisions based on triage choices
- Dr. Dawnbringer's psychological response to implementing their advice
- Practical complications arising from the chosen system ### Aftermath Phase

Long-term consequences unfold over subsequent sessions:
- Changes in community trust of medical system
- Political ramifications of triage decisions
- Personal relationships affected by who was saved or lost
- Dr. Dawnbringer's career and mental health impacts ### Character Values Testing

Each PC's background and stated values get tested against practical necessity. Characters must confront the gap between ideals and implementation. ### Utilitarian versus Deontological Ethics

Players explore whether good outcomes justify problematic methods, or whether some principles must be maintained regardless of consequences. ### Professional Ethics versus Personal Relationships

The quest examines how professional obligations conflict with personal loyalties and emotional attachments. ### Collective versus Individual Responsibility

Players consider whether community needs can justify individual sacrifices, and who has authority to make such determinations. ## DM Notes This quest works best when players have established relationships with potential plague victims before the crisis begins. Build emotional investment by showing NPCs in their daily lives, then force difficult choices about their fates. **Managing Emotional Impact**: Medical triage scenarios can be emotionally intense. Provide clear boundaries about player comfort levels and offer moments of hope within the tragedy. **Avoiding Paralysis**: Set reasonable time limits for decisions, emphasizing that delay itself causes harm. Focus on the decision-making process rather than finding perfect solutions. **Long-term Integration**: Use the consequences of triage decisions in future adventures, showing how moral choices shape the ongoing campaign world. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A document has gone missing and war looms
