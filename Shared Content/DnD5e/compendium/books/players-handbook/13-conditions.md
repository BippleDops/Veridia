# Conditions
*Source: Player's Handbook, p. 289* 

Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as [blinded](/rules/conditions.md#blinded), are impairments, but a few, such as [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible), can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone) condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

For a full list of the conditions, see the conditions page. The conditions are:- [blinded](/rules/conditions.md#blinded)- [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed)- [deafened](/rules/conditions.md#deafened)- [exhaustion](/rules/conditions.md#exhaustion)- [frightened](/rules/conditions.md#frightened)- [grappled](/rules/conditions.md#grappled)- [incapacitated](/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated)- [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible)- [paralyzed](/rules/conditions.md#paralyzed)- [petrified](/rules/conditions.md#petrified)- [poisoned](/rules/conditions.md#poisoned)- [prone](/rules/conditions.md#prone)- [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained)- [stunned](/rules/conditions.md#stunned)- [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious)
