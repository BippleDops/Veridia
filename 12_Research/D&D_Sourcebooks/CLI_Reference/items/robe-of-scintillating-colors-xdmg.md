# Robe of Scintillating Colors
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  



This robe has 3 charges, and it regains `d3` expended charges daily at dawn. While you wear it, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action and expend 1 charge to cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until the end of your next turn. During this time, the robe sheds [[bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]] in a 30-foot radius and [[dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] for an additional 30 feet, and creatures that can see you have [[disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on attack rolls against you. Any creature in the [[bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]] that can see you when the robe's power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[conditions#Stunned|Stunned]] condition until the effect ends.
