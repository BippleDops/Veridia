## Summary
Princess Celestia describes a turning current in history where choices about memory, depth, and sovereignty reshaped travel, trade, and ritual.

## Player-Facing Summary

Princess Celestia is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
