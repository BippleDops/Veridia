The target hit by the strike takes an extra `3d8` Radiant damage from the attack, and the target has the [[conditions#Blinded|Blinded]] condition until the spell ends. At the end of each of its turns, the [[conditions#Blinded|Blinded]] target makes a Constitution saving throw, ending the spell on itself on a success.
