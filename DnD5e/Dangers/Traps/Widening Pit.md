# Widening Pit
## Overview
*Mechanical trap*
These rooms are outfitted with a special floor that opens from the center when a creature steps onto the hidden 10-foot-square area pit cover at the center of the room.

A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the center of the floor. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of the floor is actually the cover of a pit.

When a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor causing the intruder to spill into the pit below, which is usually 20 or 30 feet deep, but can be deeper. Once the pit is revealed, it begins to widen. At the start of a round the pit's area grows another 5 feet on all sides as the floor begins to slide open. Creatures adjacent to the pit before it grows must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, or fall into the pit. The pit may have spikes at the bottom as described in page 123 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.

When the trap is triggered, all doors to the room immediately close and lock. The doors are iron (AC 19, 27 hit points) and any character with thieves' tools can pick the lock with a DC 20 Dexterity check. A character without thieves' tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using a hairpin, wire, or other thin, metal tool.

Once the pit is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit's cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening and springing the rest of the trap. It can also magically be held shut using the arcane lock spell or similar magic.
