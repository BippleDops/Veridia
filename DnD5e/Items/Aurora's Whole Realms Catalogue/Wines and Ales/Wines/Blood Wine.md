## Description
Blood wine, a product of Aglarond, has a heavy body and deep-red tone. The taste is lush and full, with a slight afterbite. The wine comes from a shriveled variety of grape that grows on twisted vines, grapes said to be possessed by the dead who enacted petty cruelties upon others while they lived. True or not, blood wine has a distinctly heavy flavor. Hand keg, 15 sp; cask, 4 gp; barrel, 10 gp; butt, 30 gp; tun, 70 gp.
