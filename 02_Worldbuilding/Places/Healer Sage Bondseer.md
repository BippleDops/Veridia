# Healer Sage Bondseer

*"The bonds between souls run deeper than any wound I might heal. I merely follow the threads that connect us all."*

## Overview

Sage Bondseer is one of Aquabyssos's most respected healers, known not only for her exceptional medical skills but for her unique ability to perceive the spiritual and emotional connections between individuals. She operates from a humble clinic in the Reef Gardens district, where the bioluminescent coral provides a calming atmosphere for her patients.

Unlike many healers who focus purely on physical ailments, Bondseer specializes in treating what she calls "bond sickness" - illnesses that arise from severed relationships, broken trust, or spiritual isolation. Her methods combine traditional healing with empathic magic, making her invaluable in a city where political intrigue and underwater pressures often strain community bonds.

Her reputation extends beyond Aquabyssos, with surface dwellers occasionally making the dangerous journey to the depths specifically to seek her counsel on matters of the heart and soul.

## Appearance

Bondseer appears to be in her late fifties, with silvered hair that flows like kelp around her shoulders. Her eyes are an unusual pale green that seem to shimmer with inner light when she's using her bond-sight abilities. She typically wears simple robes made from woven sea grass, adorned with small shells and coral pieces that serve as both decoration and components for her healing rituals.

Her hands bear the telltale signs of a lifetime healer - gentle but strong, with fingertips stained slightly blue from handling medicinal algae. She moves with the fluid grace of someone completely at home in the underwater environment.

## Personality
- Deeply empathetic and intuitive about others' emotional states
- Patient and methodical in her approach to healing
- Protective of her patients' privacy and fiercely independent
- Speaks in metaphors related to currents, tides, and underwater phenomena

### Special Abilities
**Bond Sight.** Bondseer can see the emotional and spiritual connections between creatures within 60 feet as shimmering threads of light. This grants her advantage on Insight checks and allows her to detect when someone is lying about their relationships.

**Empathic Healing.** When Bondseer casts a healing spell, she can choose to also heal emotional trauma, removing one condition (charmed, frightened, or similar mental effects).

### Actions
**Healing Touch.** Bondseer touches a creature and restores 2d8 + 5 hit points. She can use this ability 3 times per day.

**Bond Mending (1/day).** Bondseer can cast *zone of truth* or *calm emotions* without expending a spell slot.

**Spellcasting.** Bondseer is a 9th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following spells prepared:
- Cantrips: *guidance*, *mending*, *thaumaturgy*
- 1st level (4 slots): *cure wounds*, *detect magic*, *sanctuary*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *lesser restoration*, *zone of truth*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *dispel magic*, *remove curse*
- 4th level (3 slots): *freedom of movement*, *greater restoration*
- 5th level (1 slot): *greater restoration*, *mass cure wounds*

## Background

Bondseer was born in the outer settlements of Aquabyssos to a family of pearl divers. Her gift manifested early when she could see the pain in her injured father's relationship with her mother after a diving accident left him partially disabled. She began apprenticing with the settlement's healer at age twelve, quickly surpassing her master's abilities.

She moved to the main city twenty years ago after a vision showed her the growing spiritual sickness that would plague Aquabyssos as political tensions increased. Her arrival coincided with the first major factional disputes that would eventually lead to the current crisis.

Throughout her career, she has treated everyone from common citizens to high-ranking officials, always maintaining strict neutrality. This has earned her respect from all factions, though it has also made her a target for those who would use her abilities for political gain.

## Current Activities

Bondseer currently operates her clinic while secretly documenting the spiritual decay she observes in the city's leadership. She's noticed that several key political figures show signs of what she calls "corrupted bonds" - relationships that have been artificially twisted by outside influence.

She's been quietly building a network of trusted healers and empaths throughout the city, preparing for what she believes will be a spiritual crisis that will require coordinated intervention.

## Relationships
- **The Pearl Guard**: Respected neutral party who treats their wounded
- **Sister Morwyn**: Fellow healer and trusted colleague
- **Various Faction Leaders**: Patient-healer relationships, strictly professional
- **Reef Garden Residents**: Beloved community healer and protector

## Secrets
- She can see that several high-ranking officials have been magically influenced
- Keeps detailed records of the "bond corruption" spreading through the city
- Has been contacted by surface-world healers who suspect something supernatural is affecting Aquabyssos
- Possesses an ancient triton artifact that enhances her bond-sight abilities

## Quest Hooks
1. Bondseer approaches the party after noticing their bonds have been affected by their adventures, offering healing and information about spiritual threats in the city.
2. She needs protection while investigating a series of mysterious relationship breakdowns among the city's elite that she suspects are magically induced.
3. A patient's bond-sickness reveals a conspiracy, and Bondseer needs discrete investigators to uncover the truth without compromising her neutrality.

## DM Notes
Bondseer serves as an excellent information source and neutral safe haven for parties. Her bond-sight ability can provide unique insights into NPCs' relationships and motivations. Use her empathic abilities to provide emotional depth to encounters and to highlight the human cost of the political conflicts in Aquabyssos.
