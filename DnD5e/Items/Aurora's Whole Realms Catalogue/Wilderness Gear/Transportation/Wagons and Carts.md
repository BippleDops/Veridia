## Description
Almost as soon as humans and demihumans began shifting their burdens to the backs of animals, animals began shifting their burdens to carts and wagons. Our cart (30 gp) has rugged runners, a solid wooden wheel, and a steel axle. It can carry up to 250 lbs of material. For heavier loads, our wagon (80 gp) works perfectly with our team [[Harnesses|harnesses]]. The wagon can hold up to 4 tons of material.
