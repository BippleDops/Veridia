## Special Traits
***Amphibious.*** The grung can breathe air and water.

***Poisonous Skin.*** Any creature that grapples the grung or otherwise comes into direct contact with the grung's skin must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature no longer in direct contact with the grung can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Standing Leap.*** The grung's long jump is up to 25 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

***Variant: Grung Poison.*** Grung poison loses its potency 1 minute after being removed from a grung. A similar breakdown occurs if the grung dies.

A creature poisoned by a grung can suffer an additional effect that varies depending on the grung's skin color. This effect lasts until the creature is no longer poisoned by the grung.

***Orange.*** The poisoned creature is frightened of its allies.

***Gold.*** The poisoned creature is charmed and can speak Grung.

## Actions

***Shortbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d6+3`) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (`dice: 2d4`) poison damage.

***Mesmerizing Chirr (Recharge 6).*** The grung makes a chirring noise to which grungs are immune. Each humanoid or beast that is within 15 feet of the grung and able to hear it must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of the grung's next turn.
