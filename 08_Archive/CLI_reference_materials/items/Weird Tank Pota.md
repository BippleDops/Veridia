# Weird Tank
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/weird-tank.webp#right)


A weird tank is a ten-gallon tank of blown glass and sculpted bronze with a backpack-like carrying harness fashioned from tough leather. A [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird-xmm|water weird]] is contained within the tank. While wearing the tank, you can use an action to open it, allowing the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird-xmm|water weird]] to emerge. The [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird-xmm|water weird]] acts immediately after you in the initiative order, and it is bound to the tank.

You can command the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird-xmm|water weird]] telepathically (no action required) while you wear the tank. You can close the tank as an action only if you have first commanded the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird-xmm|water weird]] to retract into it or if the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird-xmm|water weird]] is dead.

If the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird-xmm|water weird]] is killed, the tank loses its magical containment property until it spends at least 24 hours inside an elemental water node. When the tank is recharged, a new [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird-xmm|water weird]] forms inside it.

The tank has AC 15, 50 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing the tank to 0 hit points destroys it and the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird-xmm|water weird]] contained within it.
