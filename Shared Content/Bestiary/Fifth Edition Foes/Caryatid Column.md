## Special Traits
**Immunity to Magic:** A caryatid column automatically succeeds on all saving throws against spells and spell-like effects. If a successful saving throw reduces damage by half, the caryatid column takes no damage instead. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below (these effects override its immunity). " A stone shape spell cancels the caryatid column's immunity to magic for `dice: 1d4` rounds.

**Shatter Weapons:** Whenever a character strikes a caryatid column with a melee weapon and the attack roll is a natural 1, 2, or 3, the character must make a Str check. The character's Str bonus is added to the roll, but the character's proficiency bonus and the weapon's magical bonus (if any) are subtracted from the roll. If the result is 15 or less, there is no effect. If the result is 16 or higher, the weapon shatters and becomes useless.

## Description
A caryatid column is akin to the stone golem. Both are magical constructs created by spellcasters, but caryatid columns have a much narrower purpose. They are always created for a very specific defensive function. The caryatid column stands 7 feet tall and weighs around 1,500 pounds. The column always wields a weapon (usually a longsword) in its left hand. The weapon itself is constructed of steel, but is melded with the column in such a way that it is indistinguishable from stone until the column animates. When melded, the sword blends into the column in a way that makes it difficult to notice at all (a DC 20 Wis \[Perception] check is needed to see it).

Caryatid columns are programmed as guardians and activate when certain conditions or stipulations are met; for example, when a living creature passes through a doorway or tampers with a locked chest guarded by a caryatid column. A caryatid column can’t move more than 50 feet from the spot it guards.
