# Count Strahd von Zarovich - Shadow-Crystal Lord

## Cordelia Integration
Originally from Barovia, Count Strahd has become entangled with the [[Shadow Conspiracy]] through his pursuit of immortality and power. His domain now exists as a convergence zone between realms, where shadow magic and crystal corruption merge.

## Background
Strahd discovered crystal technology during his vampiric existence and became obsessed with its power. Through shadow magic rituals, he bound his castle to a floating island that phases between Aquabyssos depths and Aethermoor heights.

## Current Role
- **Shadow Conspiracy Lieutenant**: Commands undead forces for covert operations
- **Crystal Corruption Research**: Experiments with combining vampire magic and crystal enhancement
- **Convergence Zone Guardian**: Controls a strategic reality merger point

## Abilities (Adapted)
- **Crystal Bite**: Vampiric drain that also spreads crystal corruption
- **Shadow Phase**: Can shift his domain between realms at will
- **Pressure/Wind Immunity**: Adapted to survive in both deep and high environments
- **Corrupted Charm**: Mind control enhanced by crystal resonance

## Relationships
- **[[The Shadow Conspiracy]]**: Reluctant ally, pursues own agenda
- **[[Queen Seraphina]]**: Sees her corruption as inferior to his own
- **[[Deep Mother]]**: Fears this entity as it threatens his immortality

## Plot Hooks
- Players discover Strahd's castle appearing near [[The Convergence Point]]
- Shadow operatives are recruiting using vampiric conversion
- Crystal-enhanced undead begin appearing in both realms
- Strahd seeks one of the [[Seven Shards]] for ultimate power
