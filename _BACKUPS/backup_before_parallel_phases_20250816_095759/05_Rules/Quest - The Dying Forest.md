The ancient Silverleaf Forest outside Aethermoor is withering at an alarming rate, with trees blackening and wildlife fleeing. Druid Elara Moonwhisper believes a corruption spreads from the forest's heart, threatening not only the woodland but the entire region's magical balance. ## Quest Giver

### Primary

- Main quest goal ### Optional

- Secondary objectives
- Hidden goals ## Background

The Silverleaf Forest has stood for millennia, its magical trees providing protection and wonder to Aethermoor. Recent weeks brought reports of blackened branches, dying animals, and strange whispers in the wind. Local rangers refuse to venture deep into the woods after three scouts disappeared. Consequently, ## Investigation Phase

**Forest Edge Discoveries:**

- Ancient ritual circle with broken protective stones
- Aberrant symbols carved into dying tree trunks
- Underground cave system emanating corruption
- Twisted fey creatures serving unknown master ## The Source

**The Blighted Heart:** Deep within the forest lies a corrupted World Tree, infected by Far Realm energy leaked through a planar rift. The corruption spreads through root networks, transforming the forest into an aberrant ecosystem. ### Primary Antagonist

2. **Aberrant Animal Pack** (CR 4) - Mutated wolves with psychic abilities
3. **The Blighted Dryads** (CR 7) - Three corrupted forest spirits
4. **Malachar the Fallen** (CR 8) - Final boss in the corrupted World Tree ## Multiple Solutions

**Purification Route:** Gather rare herbs to create cleansing ritual (requires Nature/Medicine)
