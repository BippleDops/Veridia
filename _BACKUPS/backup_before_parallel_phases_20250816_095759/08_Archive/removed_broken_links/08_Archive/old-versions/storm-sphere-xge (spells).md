*4th-level, Evocation* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/storm-sphere.webp#right) - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute A 20-foot-radius sphere of whirling air springs into existence, centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spell's duration. Each creature in the sphere when it appears or that ends its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take``dice: 2d6``bludgeoning damage. The sphere's space is difficult terrain. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the center of the sphere toward one creature you choose within 60 feet of the center. Make a ranged spell attack. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in the sphere. On a hit, the target takes``dice: 4d6``lightning damage. Creatures within 30 feet of the sphere have disadvantage on Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception) checks made to listen. **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage for each of its effects increases by`d6`for each slot level above 4th. **Classes**: [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes *Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 166* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Storm sphere xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of storm sphere xge as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around storm sphere xge. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
