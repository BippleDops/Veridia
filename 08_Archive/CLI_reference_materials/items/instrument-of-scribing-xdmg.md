# Instrument of Scribing
*Wondrous item, common*  



This [musical instrument](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/musical-instrument-xphb.md) has 3 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. While you are playing it, you can take a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to expend 1 charge and write a magical message on a nonmagical object or surface that you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The message can be up to six words long and is written in a language you know. If you are a Bard, you can scribe an additional seven words and make the message glow faintly, allowing it to be seen in nonmagical [Darkness](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md). Casting the [Dispel Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic-xphb.md) spell on the message erases it. Otherwise, the message fades away after 24 hours.
