*Where Two Worlds Become One, and Survival Demands Adaptation* > *"In the Merge Zones, the very air might drown you and the water may refuse to wet your skin. Physics becomes negotiable, magic becomes unpredictable, and survival depends not just on what you know, but on how quickly you can adapt to rules that change with every step."*

> â€” [[Master Environmental Specialist Tidal Convergence]], Reality Merge Zone Survival Expert ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Reality Merge Zones is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Reality Merge Zones as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Reality Merge Zones. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Alliance - Achieve immortality ## Related Notes - [[Similar Topic 1
