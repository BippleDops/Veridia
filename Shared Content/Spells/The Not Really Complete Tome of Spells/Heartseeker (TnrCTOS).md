# Heartseeker (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *8th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 6 hours


## Effects
You cast this spell on a piercing weapon such as an arrow or spear. When the weapon successfully causes damage, it begins growing roots and branches which seek out vital organs as a source of nutrients. This poisons the target for 1 minute. Each round, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 6d6 necrotic damage on a failed roll, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The creature may attempt to make a Strength (Athletics) ability check to pull the weapon out. If successful, the target has suc-cessfully pulled the weapon out, but inflicts 2d8 piercing damage on itself in the process.
