## Overview

[[Senator Glaucus]], a moderate voice in the [[Parliament of Echoes]] and key supporter of surface-depth cooperation, has vanished during a routine visit to [[The Sunken Markets]]. His disappearance threatens to collapse delicate peace negotiations between [[Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos]]. Time is running out as political extremists on both sides use his absence to push for war.

## Background

Senator Glaucus was investigating reports of illegal [[Shadow Surgeons Collective]] operations in the market district when he disappeared. Security footage from [[Pressure Tubes]] shows him entering a seemingly legitimate memory merchant's stall, but he never emerged. His bodyguards were found days later, their memories completely wiped.

### Phase 1: The Senator's Last Steps (1 session)

**Location:** [[The Sunken Markets]]  
**Objective:** Trace the senator's movements and identify suspects

**Key Locations to Investigate:**
- **Memory Merchant Stalls**: Several report unusual "bulk orders" for political memories
- **[[Pressure Tube Terminal]]**: Security constructs have partial recordings
- **[[The Depth Market]]**: Black market dealers may have seen something
- **Senator's Office**: Contains evidence of his investigation into shadow surgeries

**Clues to Discover:**
1. **Scheduled Meeting**: Glaucus had an appointment with "Merchant Zephyr" at Stall 7-Beta
2. **Modified Pressure Suits**: Someone has been altering suits to hide identity markers
3. **Memory Residue**: Psychic traces of fear and confusion around the merchant stalls
4. **Ficial Records**: Large payments made to shadow surgery facilities
5. **Temporal Disturbances**: Minor time anomalies suggest magical transportation

### Phase 2: Following the Trail (1 session)

**Location:** [[Shadow Market Canals]], [[Smuggler's Cove]]  
**Objective:** Navigate the criminal underworld to find the kidnapping network

**Challenges:**
- **Trust Issues**: Criminals won't talk without proof of reliable payment or protection
- **Shadow Surgery Traps**: Areas booby-trapped with memory-altering magic
- **Rival Investigators**: Other parties (both legitimate and criminal) seeking the senator
- **Time Pressure**: Every hour increases the chance of permanent memory damage

**Key Encounters:**
- **[[Current Riders Guild]] Smuggler**: Has transport records showing unusual cargo
- **Former Shadow Surgery Patient**: Victim who escaped, has inside knowledge
- **[[Coral Throne Syndicate]] Enforcer**: Wants the senator found to maintain stability
- **Crooked Pressure Tube Operator**: Accepting bribes to alter transport logs

### Facility Layout

**Location:** Converted section of [[Ancient Siege Tunnels]] beneath [[The Sunken Markets]]  
**Security:** Memory-locked doors, emotional manipulation traps, shadow construct guards

**Key Areas:**
1. **Reception Chamber**: Disguised as legitimate memory therapy clinic
2. **Holding Cells**: Where victims await "treatment"
3. **Surgery Theater**: Where memories are extracted and altered
4. **Storage Vaults**: Crystalline containers holding stolen memories
5. **Escape Routes**: Emergency tunnels leading to [[The Cerulean Trench]]
