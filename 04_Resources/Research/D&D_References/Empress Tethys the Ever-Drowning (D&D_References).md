--- > [!figure] Portrait # Empress Tethys the Ever-Drowning *"I have died ten thousand times, and each death teaches me the same lesson: the surface world is a beautiful lie we tell ourselves while drowning."* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Empress Tethys rules [[Aquabyssos through a unique curse/blessing - she drowns to death every dawn and resurrects every dusk, losing and regaining memories in fragments. She is simultaneously the most and least powerful being in the underwater realm, experiencing existence from infinite perspectives. ## The Multiple Tethys Theory

Unknown to most, each death creates a "temporal echo" of Tethys that descends to different depths:
- **Twilight Tethys**: The public face, maintains diplomacy
- **Midnight Tethys**: The true ruler, makes hard decisions
- **Hadean Tethys**: The thing she's becoming, alien and powerful
- **Surface Tethys**: A version that never drowned, exists in dreams ## Current Schemes

1. **The Great Convergence**: Reuniting all versions of herself
2. **The Surface Mirror**: Creating reflection of Aquabyssos above water
3. **The Shard Drowning**: Acquiring one of Aethermoor's [The Seven Shards|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]]
4. **The Memory Harvest**: Collecting all drowned memories into herself
5. **The Final Transformation**: Becoming a Thing That Dwells Beneath ## DM Secrets

> [!danger] The Original Tethys
> The "real" Tethys died permanently 400 years ago. What rules now is an amalgamation of the collective unconscious of all who drowned, wearing her form. Each death/resurrection adds more voices to the collective. > [!warning] The Prophecy
> Tethys has seen a future where she causes the Second Drowning, submerging all worlds. She's desperately trying to prevent this while her other selves work toward it. She is both the problem and solution. > [!info] The Love That Remains
> Deep in her fractured memories, Tethys retains true love for someone on the surface - possibly an ancestor of someone in Aethermoor. This love is the only thing preventing her from fully embracing the void. If that person's descendant dies or is corrupted, she will lose her last anchor to humanity. ### Midnight Form (Full Power)

**AC:** 20 (Natural armor + deep magic)
**HP:** 450 (Regenerates unless killed by surface magic)
**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 60 ft., teleport through water **Abilities:**
- **Drowning Aura:** 30 ft radius, creatures must make CON saves or begin drowning
- **Memory Flood:** Can overwhelm minds with thousands of memories
- **Depth Pressure:** Can adjust pressure to crush or preserve
- **Resurrection Inevitable:** Returns at dusk regardless of how killed **Spells:** All water/death/mind related spells up to 9th level ## Player-Facing Summary Empress Tethys the Ever Drowning is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Empress Tethys the Ever Drowning as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Empress Tethys the Ever Drowning. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - The authorities needs help stealing before winter
