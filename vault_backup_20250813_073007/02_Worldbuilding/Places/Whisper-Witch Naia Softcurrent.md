# Whisper-Witch Naia Softcurrent

![[04_Resources/Assets/Art/Places/Whisper-Witch_Naia_Softcurrent.png|Whisper-Witch Naia Softcurrent Portrait]]

## Overview
Whisper-Witch Naia Softcurrent is a living crossroads where memory-currents and trade flows intersect. Merchants, informants, and faiths compete to steer the tides of influence. The Convergence leaves subtle scars here: whispers cling to stone, and bargains echo across depths.

## Districts and Features
- Echo Quay: A market where prices rise and fall with the memory-tide. Skilled haggling can snag artifacts before they surface elsewhere.
- Pressure Gate: A calibrated lock that equalizes depth-pressure. Factions fight to control its timing schedule and tariff keys.
- Quiet Chapel: A hush-zone where spoken oaths bind like contracts; lying inside inflicts a low psychic sting.

## Factions Present
- Pearl Guard customs officers squeeze revenue and information.
- The Coral Throne Syndicate arbitrages tariffs and rumor futures.
- Verdant Accord envoys quietly track bio-crafted goods and seed bans.

## For the Table (Quick Use)
- Negotiation DCs: Honest trade DC 12; Gray market DC 15; Smuggling DC 17. On a failure, progress with a telltale rumor seeded in the crowd instead of stalling.
- Hazards: Pressure surges (CON save DC 13 or gain 1 level of Fatigue), slipstream knocks (DEX save DC 12 or lose 1 item to the current).
- Rewards: Faction favor notes, tariff keys, market scrip worth 2d10×10 gp in local value.

## Threads to the Main Campaign
- Archivists claim a ledger fragment pointing toward [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Sunken Library of Thalassius.md|The Sunken Library of Thalassius]].
- A clandestine auction circles artifacts tied to [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]].
- An information broker with ties to [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn.md|Vex Shadowthorn]] trades memories for favors.

## Multiple Resolution Paths (Fail-Forward)
- Buy the schedule: Secure the Pressure Gate manifests; even on failure, you obtain a partial list that points to a decoy shipment and fresh leads.
- Bribe or distract: Create a diversion at Echo Quay; on a setback, the guard marks you but also warns of a coming tariff strike.
- Formal petition: Argue precedent at the Quiet Chapel; on a miss, the judge imposes a bond that grants limited passage and a clock to pay it back.
