# Red Dragon

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing an adult or ancient red dragon's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Burning Heat.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is an area of extreme heat. A burning creature or object takes an additional `d4` Fire damage at the start of each of its turns.  
- **Smoldering Haze.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is [[lightly-obscured-xphb|Lightly Obscured]] with clouds of ash. Whenever a creature other than the dragon or one of its allies finishes a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]] in that area, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition for 1 hour.  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
