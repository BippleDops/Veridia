--- ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Complete Aquabyssos Survival System > *"The depths change you. First your body, then your mind, finally your soul."* #### Depth Zones & Effects | Depth Range | Zone Name | Base DC | Pressure Effects |

|-------------|-----------|---------|------------------|
| 0-100 ft | Surface Zone | 10 | None |
| 100-500 ft | Twilight Zone | 12 | Disadvantage on Perception |
| 500-1,000 ft | Pressure Zone | 14 | 1 exhaustion/hour without protection |
| 1,000-3,000 ft | Crush Zone | 16 | `dice: 1d6` pressure damage/10 min |
| 3,000-6,000 ft | Abyss Zone | 18 | `dice: 2d6` pressure damage/10 min |
| 6,000-10,000 ft | Hadal Zone | 20 | `dice: 3d6` pressure damage/10 min |
| 10,000+ ft | Void Zone | 22+ | `dice: 4d6` pressure damage + special | #### Pressure Saves```Constitution Save: DC = 10 + (Depth in thousands of feet)

Failure Effects:
- 1st Failure: 1 level exhaustion
- 2nd Failure: Speed halved
- 3rd Failure: Incapacitated
- 4th Failure: Unconscious
- 5th Failure: Death (implosion) #### Adaptation Points (AP)

Characters accumulate AP through exposure to depths: AP Gain Rate:
- Natural exposure: 1 AP per 24 hours at depth
- Forced adaptation: 1 AP per failed pressure save
- Magical adaptation: Variable based on source
- Crystal exposure: 1 AP per corruption level #### Adaptation Stages | AP Range | Stage | Physical Changes | Mechanical Effects |

|----------|-------|------------------|-------------------|
| 0-10 | Surface Normal | None | Standard character |
| 11-25 | Early Adaptation | Slight webbing, pale skin | Hold breath x2 duration |

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Depth Survival Mechanics as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Depth Survival Mechanics. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The First Prophecy of Depths ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[Complete Pressure Adaptation System
