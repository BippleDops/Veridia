*Several varieties of gargoyles exist, and each is detailed below. For all their differences, gargoyles also share some common traits. They can remain utterly motionless for days, weeks, or even years, and they are indistinguishable from stone for as long as they remain still. Regardless of how long they’ve been inert, they can spring into sudden, savage action in an instant.*

*This winged humanoid is carved from a strange green stone, with eyes that are deep ebony in color.*

## Special Traits
**Reanimation:** A green guardian gargoyle that is destroyed will reanimate `dice: 1d8+2` days later unless its eyes are removed, crushed, and disenchanted by casting both dispel magic (automatic) and greater restoration on them. If the eyes are taken away but not destroyed, they simply disappear from wherever they are and reappear in the green guardian's eye sockets at the moment it reanimates. The same applies to any other body parts that were demolished or removed.

**Stony Appearance:** While a green guardian gargoyle sits motionless, it can't be detected as a living creature by any means.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A green guardian gargoyle attacks once with claws and gores once with its horns.

**Claws:*** Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (`dice: 2d8+2`) slashing damage. If both claw attacks hit the same target, the target is also grappled and restrained.

**Gore:*** Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d8+2`) piercing damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any land, aquatic, and underground

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, or wing (5–16)

## Description
Green guardian gargoyles are carved from a strange, green stone. Their only features that are not this stone are their eyes, which are black jet; they can easily be appraised to have a value of 200 gp apiece by someone who knows gems, but they also detect as magic (conjuration) under a detect magic spell.

The green guardian gargoyles’ preferred way to kill their victims is to direct all their attacks at the same foe and grab that creature so that they can then fly them 60 feet up into the air before releasing them, letting them take another `dice: 6d6` bludgeoning damage from the fall. Fortunately, a single green guardian can carry only 150 pounds while flying, so it takes two of them to lift most Medium-sized characters. The first one to attack must establish the grapple by hitting the same target with both claw attacks. The second gargoyle needs only one of its claw attacks to hit in order to grab an arm and help hoist the character into the air.

Green guardian gargoyles are mercifully rare. So far, they are known to exist only in the halls of Rappan Athuk, where they are employed as guards and gatekeepers. It’s only a matter of time before they spread to other sites.
