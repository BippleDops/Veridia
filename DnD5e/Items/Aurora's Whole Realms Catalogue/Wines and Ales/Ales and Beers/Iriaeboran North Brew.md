## Description
This local brew is best appreciated by less-refined palates than my own, but is passing fare for tavern or home consumption. This dark amber liquid has a harsh, bitter aftertaste (sold by Iriaeboreans as “the bite of the north [[Winds|winds]]”) that is, for many, an acquired taste. The product, when initially brewed ten years past, was placed in any empty barrels ordered from the city; this practice stopped in order to increase the plummeting orders of the cask trade. Hand keg, 9 cp; cask, 5 sp; barrel, 12 sp; butt, 4 gp; tun, 8 gp.
