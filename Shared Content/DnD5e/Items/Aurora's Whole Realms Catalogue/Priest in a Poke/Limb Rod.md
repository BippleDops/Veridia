### Limb Rod (Pic)

## Description
Sometimes encounters with ponderous monsters leave an adventurer’s limbs bending in all the wrong places. Unless a priest is on hand, those bones may mend incorrectly, if at all. With this gnomish contraption, however, a snapped bone can be popped back into place, ready for splinting. Merely place the affected limb in the adjustable frame and turn the crank attached to the hand or foot until the bones snap in line. Then use our splints to set the limb. (8 gp)

## Additional Details
½ Dex check allows realignment, failure adds `dice: 1d4` points of damage
