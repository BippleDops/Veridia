# Yester Hill Axe
*Weapon ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/battleaxe-xphb|battleaxe]])*  


- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d8 slashing
  - Two-handed: 1d10 slashing
- **Properties**: [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties#Versatile|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

The axe's handle is carved with leaves and vines, and it weighs half as much as a normal battleaxe. When the axe hits a plant, whether an ordinary plant or a plant creature, the target takes an extra `d8` slashing damage. When a creature of non-good alignment wields the axe, it sprouts thorns whenever its wielder makes an attack with it. These thorns prick the wielder for 1 piercing damage after the attack is made, and this damage is considered magical.
