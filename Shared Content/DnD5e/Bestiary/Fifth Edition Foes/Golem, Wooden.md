## Description
Arcane spellcasters used several ancient texts to arrive at a process to create inexpensive yet still reasonably powerful golems. They had master craftsmen create wooden statues with articulated limbs and then performed the proper spells to animate and control them. The statues vary widely in shape and form, but most have weapons in both hands.

The original wooden golems were designed to act both as guards and as alarms, and most still do. Wooden golems can emit a deafening howl when intruders enter the area they’ve been set to guard. Besides deafening nearby intruders, this howl can be heard through 600 feet of winding corridor and carries for up to two miles in the open.

Wooden golems are usually programmed to seek cover against ranged weapons and spells, but lacking any real sense of selfpreservation, they never break off combat simply because they’re losing.

A wooden golem is assembled from blocks of fine wood and sprinkled during its construction with rare powders and crushed herbs worth at least 300 gp. The head of a destroyed wooden golem can be turned into a fine sculpture for a mantel or entryway, if it wasn’t damaged in battle. Some collectors pay handsomely for such relics.
