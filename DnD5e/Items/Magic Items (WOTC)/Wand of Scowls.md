# Wand of Scowls

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Wand

**Rarity:** common

**Weight**: 1 lbs.

## Description

This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges and target a humanoid you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Charisma saving throw or be forced to scowl for 1 minute.

The wand regains all expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice: d20`. On a 1, the wand transforms into a [[wand of smiles]].
