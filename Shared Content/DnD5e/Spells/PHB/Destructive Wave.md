# Destructive Wave
You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take `dice: 5d6|avg` (5d6) thunder damage, as well as `dice: 5d6|avg` (5d6) radiant or necrotic damage (your choice), and be knocked [[prone]]. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [[prone]].
