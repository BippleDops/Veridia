[[lz42lnqr.vjb.png|open outside]]

*The body of this spiderlike creature is a mass of humanoid faces caught in drawn-out, hideous screams. Ten spindly legs rise unevenly from the bulbous mass. Between tufts of bristly hair hang needle-sharp fangs that drip with a bittersmelling, thick red liquid.*

## Special Traits
**Arachnophobia Aura:** A chymic spider exudes a fear of arachnids that seeps into the psyche of all creatures within 1 mile of the chymic spider’s lair. Creatures with Intelligence 3 or higher have tactical disadvantage on saving throws against fright in this area.

**Dream Telepathy:** The chymic spider’s telepathy allows it to communicate only with creatures that are asleep and dreaming. Most creatures interpret these exchanges as normal dreams, but characters are free to reach their own conclusions. The chymic spider can also choose to create nightmares in the sleeper, who must make a successful DC 13 Wis saving throw or be paralyzed for as long as the chymic spider maintains telepathic contact (it can be lost as concentration).

**Egg Implantation:** A chymic spider can implant eggs in a helpless or paralyzed creature. The eggs hatch 24 hours later. Once the eggs hatch, at the start of each of the host’s turns, it takes `dice: 1d6` necrotic damage and must make a successful DC 12 Con saving throw or be paralyzed by pain and spiderling poison until the start of its next turn. This continues until the spiderlings are destroyed or removed. Spiderlings can be removed by inflicting `dice: 4d6` slashing damage on the host (halved with a successful DC 13 Wis \[Medicine] check by the creature doing the damage) or destroyed with a greater restoration spell or comparable magic. If the host dies, a swarm of spiders bursts from the body.

## Actions
**Melee Attack—Bite:** +5 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d4 + 2` piercing damage plus `dice: 2d8` poison damage, and a creature must make a successful DC 12 Con saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A paralyzed creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect with a success.

**Area Attack—Chyme Spray (recharge 6):** The chymic spider expels the chymic juices from its stomach in a 15-foot cone. Creatures in the cone take `dice: 6d6` acid damage, or half damage with a successful DC 11 Dex saving throw. The juice sticks to creatures that failed their saving throws, and they take `dice: 3d6` acid damage at the ends of their next 2 turns unless the acid is removed by using an action to make a successful DC 13 Wis (Medicine) check, or is neutralized with vinegar, alcohol, or a similar substance.

## Description
**Environment**: Urban (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary

Chymic spiders are not true spiders, but rather born from the fear that spiders instill within many intelligent humanoids and inherently linked to the fabric of fear. These cunning aberrations sneak through the city rooftops and await their prey for days on end. Anyone who wanders into the chymic spider’s 1-mile radius that might be the least bit fearful of spiders is quickly identified, and the chymic spider begins methodically stalking the victim, waiting for its chance to make dream contact.

These rare creatures lurk along the edges of Sister Lyme, hiding in gables, chimneys, and under eaves and seemingly found nowhere else in the world. Composed from the latent fears of arachnids somehow given life, the creature is able to project these primal fears into any living creature. It simply prefers to stalk and prey on those who fear it most. It is able to project these nightmares and can cause victims to be paralyzed while it enters their lairs, and lays its eggs within them. The baby spiders within whisper to their new host, wanting to be fed, obsessing about food, and within 24 hours they erupt to feed on their host before separating to make their own lairs. After a chymic spider successfully reproduces, it quickly withers and dies, leaving behind only a spiderlike husk that the crows and vermin of the city quickly consume. Newborn chymic spiders don’t begin their own reproduction hunts for `dice: 1d3` years after birth.
