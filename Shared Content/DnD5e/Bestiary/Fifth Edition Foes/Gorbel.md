## Special Traits
**Explosive:** When a gorbel takes piercing or slashing damage, it must make a successful Constitution saving throw or it explodes. The DC for the saving throw equals 5 plus the damage taken from the attack. When it explodes, all creatures within 5 feet of it take 4 (`dice: 1d6+1`) force damage, or half damage with a successful DC 11 Dexterity saving throw. The gorbel dies instantly, of course.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A gorbel bites once and attacks once with claws.

**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d6+2`) piercing damage.

**Claw:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 2 (`dice: 1d4`) slashing damage. A target of Small size or smaller is pulled to within 5 feet of the gorbel; if the target is Medium size or larger, the gorbel pulls itself to within 5 feet of the target.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Warm forests

**Organization**: Solitary or swarm (2–10)

## Description
The gorbel is a strange creature approximately 3 feet in diameter, possibly related to the gas spore. Its reddish skin is a tough, rubbery membrane that is tragically thin. The spherical body of a gorbel is filled with a lighter-than-air gas that smells of rotten eggs (sulfur) and that reacts violently with air.

A gorbel eats, breathes, and excretes through an aperture best described as a mouth. This mouth is lined with a ring of sharp teeth that face inward to help it force food into its gullet.

Gorbels primarily attack with their claws, which they can extend elastically to tremendous lengths and hook into prey. They then either drag the prey to their mouths, or drag their mouths to the prey. A gorbel will attack and try to eat whatever it suspects might be edible—generally, that covers anything that moves. The strange metabolic processes that produce the gorbel’s light-than-air gas also instill it with an insatiable hunger.
