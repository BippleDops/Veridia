| 4 |`d4`[gnoll-warrior-xmm|gnolls]] and``dice: 2d4``[[hyena-xmm (beast) |
| 5 | A grove of burned trees. Characters searching the area and succeeding on a **DC 10** Wisdom ([skills#Survival|Survival]]) check find [[gnoll-warrior-xmm|gnoll tracks. Following the tracks for`d4`hours leads to an encounter with [gnoll-warrior-xmm|gnolls]], or the discovery of dead [[gnoll-warrior-xmm|gnolls with elven arrows sticking out of their flea-ridden corpses. |
| 6 | 1 [giant-owl-xmm|giant owl]] |
| 7 | An ivy-covered statue of an elven deity or hero. |

| 9 |`d4`[[centaur-trooper-xmm|centaurs |
| 10 |``dice: 2d4``[Bestiary]] (elves). One [[Bestiary carries a horn and can use its action to blow it. If the horn is blown within the forest, roll on this table again. If the result indicates a monster encounter, the indicated monster or monsters arrive in`d4`minutes. New arrivals other than [gnoll-warrior-xmm|gnolls]], [[hyena-xmm (beast), [owlbear-xmm (monstrosity)]], and [[displacer-beast-xmm|displacer beasts are friendly toward the [Bestiary]]. |
| 11 |``dice: 2d4``[[Pixie Xmm (50%) or``dice: 2d4``[sprite-xmm (fey)]] (50%) |
| 12 | 1 [[owlbear-xmm (monstrosity) |

| 14 |`d4`[blink-dog-xmm|blink dogs]] |
| 15 | A magical plant with``dice: 2d4``glowing berries. A creature that ingests a berry becomes [[conditions#Invisible|invisible for 1 hour, or until it attacks or casts a spell. Once picked, a berry loses its magic after 12 hours. Berries regrow at midnight, but if all its berries are picked, the plant becomes nonmagical and grows no more berries. |
| 16 | An elven tune carried on a gentle breeze |
| 17 |`d4`[faerie-dragon-youth-xmm|orange]] (75%) or [[faerie-dragon-adult-xmm|blue (25%) faerie dragons |
| 18 | 1 [Bestiary]] (elf). The [[Bestiary is initially indifferent toward the party but becomes friendly if the characters agree to rid the forest of its gnoll infestation. |
| 19 | 1 [treant-xmm (plant)]]. The [[treant-xmm (plant) is friendly if the party includes one or more elves or is accompanied by a visible fey creature. The [treant-xmm (plant)]] is hostile if the characters are carrying open flames. Otherwise, it is indifferent and doesn't announce its presence as the characters pass by. |
| 20 | 1 [[unicorn-xmm (celestial)]] |
