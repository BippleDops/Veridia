# Acid Storm (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 150 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
A storm made of gelatinous, acidic droplets appears in a location you choose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least once face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 4d10 acid dam-age on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one, each round that the creature ends its turn in the storm and for one round afterwards.
