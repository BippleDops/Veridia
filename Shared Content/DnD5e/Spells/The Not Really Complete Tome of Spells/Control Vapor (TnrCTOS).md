# Control Vapor (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a bean or pea)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You pick a point within range that con-tains mist of any sort, even magically-created mists. You can control all mists within a 30-foot radius sphere of that point. You may move it as you will, with a speed of 40 feet, hold it still, or split it multiple smaller clouds, and so on.

If the mist is actually an intelligent being such as a vampire in mist-form, that creature must make a Charisma saving throw. You cannot cause the creature damage through this spell.
