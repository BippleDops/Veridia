# Aethermoor
*The Shattered Crown Continent*

## Overview
Aethermoor is a continent forever changed by the Great Crystallization, an event 500 years ago when massive spires of crystallized magic erupted from the earth. These Aether Crystals grant incredible magical power but come with a terrible price - prolonged exposure causes crystalline corruption, slowly transforming living beings into crystal themselves.

## History

### The Three Epochs

#### The Age of the Crown (Before Great Crystallization)
When the God-King Aetheron ruled with the Crown of Stars, maintaining perfect order through divine mandate.

#### The Shattering (500 years ago)
[[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Crystallization]] - Aetheron was betrayed by his seven advisors. The Crown of Stars shattered, its fragments piercing the earth and emerging as Aether Crystals. This event is detailed in [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Shattering of the Crown]].

#### The Crystal Age (Present)
Five centuries of adaptation to crystal magic. The rise of the [[Crystal Wardens]], the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Purist Coalition]], and other factions vying for control.

- **Green** - Nature and healing magic
- **Black** - Necromancy and shadow magic
- **Gold** - Extremely rare, divine magic

### Crystal Corruption
Extended use causes **Aether Sickness**:
1. Stage 1: Crystalline veins appear on skin
2. Stage 2: Partial paralysis, enhanced magical ability
3. Stage 3: Complete crystallization, consciousness trapped

### Crystal Technology
- **Aether Engines** - Power cities and airships
- **Crystal Weapons** - Enhanced magical armaments
- **Resonance Towers** - Long-distance communication
