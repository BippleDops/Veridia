## Description
Girdles are not only a perfect ornament for the hips but also a useful article of clothing. All our girdles are 2 inches wide, made of finest silk, and embroidered with curvilinear patterns by [[Calishite]] craftsmen. The girdles themselves come in blue, green, red, and yellow, each with gold thread embroidery upon them. The pattern can be geometric, floral, or curvilinear. All girdles are 6 gp.
