The Crystal Singer represents a unique bardic tradition that harnesses the resot frequencies of magical crystals to create powerful effects. These performers bridge the gap between [[Aquabyssos]] and [[Aethermoor]], using crystalline harmonics to manipulate reality, heal the corrupted, and communicate across dimensional boundaries. They are as much scientists as artists, studying the fundamental frequencies that bind the dual worlds together. ## Core Concept

Crystal Singers are bards who have learned to attune their voices and instruments to the natural resoce of magical crystals. They can purify corrupted crystals, enhance magical effects, and even stabilize reality tears through harmonic intervention. Many serve as diplomats between the two worlds, as their abilities work equally well in water and air environments. ### Bardic College: College of Crystal Harmonics

At 3rd level, Crystal Singer Bards join the College of Crystal Harmonics: ### Feature: Academic Network

You have contacts among crystal researchers, magical theorists, and court wizards throughout both worlds. You can access libraries, laboratories, and crystal collections for research. Scholars will often trade information about crystal properties and corruption patterns. ## Cultural Significance

Crystal Singers are revered in both worlds as healers of corruption and bridges between dimensions. They are often called upon for diplomatic missions, reality stabilization efforts, and major purification rituals. Their unique understanding of crystalline science makes them invaluable in the ongoing efforts to combat the [[Crystal Plague]] and maintain stability between [[Aquabyssos]] and [[Aethermoor]]. This build emphasizes the intersection of magic, music, and science that defines the Crystal Singer tradition, offering both mechanical benefits and rich roleplaying opportunities. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*
