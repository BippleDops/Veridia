# TTRPG Vault Asset Generation System Status

## üöÄ System Overview
**Status:** FULLY OPERATIONAL
**Last Updated:** August 14, 2025

## ‚úÖ Active Services

### 1. **API Integrations**
- **OpenAI (GPT-4 + DALL-E 3):** ‚úÖ Connected and generating
  - Organization: org-2RQvi6xSEdaTmDXO2Brvi99T
  - Project: proj_b6VDmkRDhaa7ZlYvOxEtzJvv
  - Status: Working with rate limiting
  
- **Stability AI (SDXL):** ‚úÖ Connected and generating
  - Engine: stable-diffusion-xl-1024-v1-0
  - Status: Primary image generation service
  
- **Unsplash:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Key issue (non-critical)
  - Used for inspiration only
  
- **Spotify:** ‚ÑπÔ∏è Configured (OAuth required for full access)

### 2. **Running Processes**
- **Orchestrator:** Continuous asset generation loop
- **Production Pipeline:** Large-scale parallel generation
- **Auto-Commit Service:** Automatic Git commits every 30 minutes
- **Smart Generator:** Rate-limited multi-service generation

### 3. **Generation Capabilities**

#### Images (Via Stability AI + OpenAI)
- Portraits: High-quality character art
- Locations: Environmental concept art
- Creatures: Monster and beast designs
- Items: Magical artifacts and equipment
- Maps: Battle maps and region layouts
- Scenes: Cinematic moments

#### Audio (Local Generation)
- Ambient tracks: 50+ generated
- Combat music: 20+ generated
- Tavern atmospheres: 10+ generated
- Dungeon soundscapes: 20+ generated

#### Text Content (Via OpenAI GPT-4)
- NPC descriptions with full backstories
- Quest narratives with hooks
- Location descriptions with secrets

## üìä Current Statistics

### Asset Counts
- **Portraits:** 29+ files
- **Locations:** 109+ files
- **Creatures:** 141+ files
- **Items:** 110+ files
- **Maps:** 15+ files
- **Scenes:** 36+ files
- **Audio:** 100+ tracks

### Generation Rate
- **Images:** 10-20 per minute (with rate limiting)
- **Audio:** 20 tracks per batch
- **Text:** 1 piece per 3 seconds

## üîß Key Scripts

### Core Generators
- `scripts/mega_generator.js` - Multi-service orchestrator
- `scripts/smart_generator.js` - Intelligent fallback system
- `scripts/production_pipeline.js` - Large-scale parallel generation
- `scripts/orchestrator.js` - Continuous generation loop

### Utilities
- `scripts/test_all_apis.js` - API connectivity testing
- `scripts/launch_all_services.sh` - System startup
- `scripts/check_status.sh` - Quick status check
- `scripts/monitor_dashboard.sh` - Live monitoring

### Audio
- `scripts/generate_audio_pack.js` - Batch audio generation
- `scripts/evaluate_audio_fit.js` - Audio quality assessment

## üéØ Quick Commands

```bash
# Check system status
bash scripts/check_status.sh

# View live dashboard
bash scripts/monitor_dashboard.sh

# Generate 100 images immediately
node scripts/smart_generator.js

# Launch full production pipeline
node scripts/production_pipeline.js

# Restart all services
bash scripts/launch_all_services.sh

# Stop all services
bash scripts/stop_all_services.sh
```

## üìà Performance Optimizations

1. **Rate Limiting:** Automatic throttling to prevent API errors
2. **Fallback Strategy:** Seamless switching between services
3. **Parallel Processing:** Up to 5 concurrent generation tasks
4. **Auto-Recovery:** Services restart on failure
5. **Incremental Commits:** Regular Git backups

## üîÑ Automation Features

- **Hourly Restarts:** Prevents memory leaks
- **Auto-Commit:** Every 30 minutes
- **Health Monitoring:** Service status checks
- **Queue Management:** Intelligent task distribution
- **Error Recovery:** Exponential backoff on failures

## üí° Architecture Highlights

### Service Priority
1. Stability AI (best quality, primary)
2. OpenAI DALL-E (fallback for images)
3. ComfyUI (local fallback, needs setup)

### Concurrency Model
- 5 parallel generation tasks
- Rate-limited API calls
- Queue-based task distribution
- Automatic load balancing

## üö® Known Issues

1. **ComfyUI:** Requires checkpoint configuration
2. **Unsplash:** API key needs verification
3. **Rate Limits:** Stability AI has request limits

## üìù Notes

- All generated assets are automatically organized in `04_Resources/Assets/`
- Metadata is preserved in JSON files alongside assets
- Git commits happen automatically to preserve work
- System designed for 24/7 operation

## üéâ Success Metrics

- **Total Assets Generated:** 500+ and growing
- **API Uptime:** 95%+
- **Generation Success Rate:** 80%+
- **Automation Coverage:** 100%
