_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_ The region containing a dracolich's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects: - **Sapping Mist.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is [[lightly-obscured-xphb (variant-rules) by pale fog. Whenever a creature other than the dracolich or one of its allies finishes a [long-rest-xphb]] in that area, it must succeed on a **DC 15** Constitution saving throw or gain 1 [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion level. - **Soul Drain.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair have [Advantage Xphb]] on Death Saving Throws. If the dracolich is destroyed or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. The effects resume if the dracolich gains a new body (see its Soul Gem trait). ## Player-Facing Summary Dracolich xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of dracolich xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around dracolich xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Second Prophecy of Shadows ## Plot Hooks - Someone is blackmailing a witness for revenge
