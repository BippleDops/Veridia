## Campaign Use Guidelines

### Progressive Revelation
Introduce cultists in order of transformation stage:
1. **Early Campaign**: Stage 1-2 cultists seem like beneficial self-help group
2. **Mid Campaign**: Stage 3-4 cultists reveal true scope and power
3. **Late Campaign**: Stage 5 cultists demonstrate cosmic consequences
4. **Final Campaign**: First Drowned represents ultimate choice

### Moral Complexity
Each cultist should present genuine benefits alongside obvious dangers:
- **Stage 1-2**: Measurable improvements to life quality and mental health
- **Stage 3-4**: Remarkable abilities and knowledge that could help others
- **Stage 5**: Cosmic wisdom and perspective that reveals greater truths

### Character Development
Use cultists to challenge players' assumptions:
- Former friends or allies who joined willingly and benefited
- Enemies who offer compelling arguments about reality's nature
- Tragic figures trapped between human and cosmic perspectives
- Authority figures using cult resources for genuinely good purposes

### Information Vectors
Different transformation stages provide different types of information:
- **Stage 1**: Recruitment methods and early cult activities
- **Stage 2**: Intermediate rituals and transformation processes
- **Stage 3**: Leadership structure and major cult operations
- **Stage 4**: Deep Mother's nature and cosmic plans
- **Stage 5**: Universal truths and campaign endgame scenarios

### Combat Considerations
Cultist encounters should emphasize horror over combat:
- **Low Stage**: Focus on social interaction and moral dilemmas
- **Mid Stage**: Emphasize supernatural abilities and wrongness
- **High Stage**: Cosmic horror and reality-bending powers
- **Final Stage**: Existential confrontation beyond normal combat

### Redemption Possibilities
Consider which cultists might be saved:
- **Stage 1-2**: Likely reversible with proper treatment
- **Stage 3-4**: Possible but requires major magical intervention
- **Stage 5**: May not want to be "saved" - philosophical question

## DM Notes

### Balancing Sympathy and Horror
Each cultist should be simultaneously sympathetic and terrifying:
- Show genuine benefits they've gained
- Demonstrate their honest belief in helping others
- Reveal the costs they've accepted or are unaware of
- Present their perspective as logical within their experience

### Character Consistency
Transformed cultists retain core personality traits:
- Marcus still loves his family deeply
- Elara remains intellectually curious
- Commandant maintains military discipline
- Doctor keeps healing focus
- Oracle preserves spiritual compassion

### Transformation Logic
Physical changes should reflect psychological evolution:
- Gills represent acceptance of Deep Mother's realm
- Parasites symbolize symbiotic thinking over individual focus
- Enhanced abilities demonstrate benefits of cosmic connection
- Appearance changes reflect departure from human limitations
