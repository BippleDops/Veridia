--- # Snare

*1st-level, Abjuration* - **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** S, M (25 feet of rope, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 8 hours As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap. This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence ([[skills#Investigation|Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be discerned. The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spell's radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is [conditions#Restrained|restrained]] there until the spell ends. A [[conditions#Restrained|restrained creature can make a Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence ([skills#Arcana|Arcana]]) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the [[conditions#Restrained|restrained effect ends. After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is [conditions#Restrained|restrained]] by it. **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]] *Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 165* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Snare xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of snare xge as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around snare xge. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Covenant - Control trade routes ## Plot Hooks - A prisoner has gone missing and evil awakens
