## Description
Without comparison throughout Toril, this spice can be compared most similarly to Malatran pepper, though much greater in bite to the tongue. These Maztican spices can easily conceal the flavor of even the worst meat. We offer these as strings of whole dried pods or ground spice. (100 gp/lb whole; 20 gp/oz ground)
