## Description
A fine chain of gold can win a ladyâ€™s hand as surely as a broad chain of iron will bind that of a hobgoblin. We offer chains in all sizes, from 1/8-inch wide ornamental chains to 4-inch wide anchor chains. The chain prices listed below are for iron chains. Steel costs twice as much and can bear twice the weight. Silver is 20 times the cost, and gold is 200 times more expensive (available only in 1/8 to 1/2 inch sizes).

**Chain (per 25 ft):**

| 1/8" | 6 sp | 6 | 12 |
| 1/4" | 2 gp | 18 | 96 |
| 1/2" | 5 gp | 36 | 970 |
