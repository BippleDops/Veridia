# Memoriam - The Forgotten Continent

> *"I know I've written about this place before, but I can't find my notes. Each time I investigate, I discover evidence of previous attempts. How many times have I been here?"*

## Overview

Memoriam is a continental paradox—a landmass the size of Abyssos Prime that everyone forgets exists the moment they stop directly observing it. Civilizations have risen and fallen here, leaving behind ruins no one remembers building. Maps show empty ocean where Memoriam sits, yet ships that sail through it arrive at their destinations with missing time and confused crews.

## The Antimemetic Properties

### The Forgetting Field
A reality-warping field that prevents memory formation about anything within or related to Memoriam:
- **Immediate**: Forget details within seconds of looking away
- **Short-term**: Forget you were here within minutes of leaving
- **Long-term**: Evidence of visits erases itself from reality
- **Permanent**: People who die here are forgotten by everyone

**Mechanical Effects**:
- Cannot use INT-based skills effectively (always disadvantage)
- Must make DC 18 WIS save to remember anything after 1 minute
- Written notes about Memoriam fade unless continuously observed
- Photographs and drawings become blank
- Maps refuse to show its location

### Persistence Techniques
Methods discovered (and rediscovered) to maintain some awareness:
- **Pain Anchoring**: Self-inflicted wounds help maintain memories briefly
- **Emotional Binding**: Traumatic or ecstatic experiences last longer
- **Paradox Loops**: Creating logical impossibilities that can't be forgotten
- **The Forgetting of Forgetting**: Forgetting that you forget sometimes works

## Geographic Mysteries

### The Uncertain City
A massive metropolis that may or may not exist. Buildings phase in and out of reality based on observation. Streets lead to different destinations each time they're walked.

**Notable Uncertain Locations**:
- **The Library of Unwritten Books**: Contains every book that was never written
- **The Museum of Neverwas**: Exhibits artifacts from histories that didn't happen
- **The Parliament of Nobody**: Elected officials who don't exist govern people who forget they live here

### The Recursive Shores
Beaches where the same wave breaks eternally because the ocean forgets it already crashed. Footprints appear before they're made and disappear while being observed.

### The Interior Void
The continent's center is a perfect nothing—not empty space, but the absence of space itself. Travelers who enter emerge from random edges with no time having passed, but aged years.

## Inhabitants (Maybe)

### The Unremembered Citizens
People live here, evidenced by warm meals in empty houses and maintained infrastructure. But they can't remember themselves, existing in a constant state of meeting everyone for the first time, including themselves in mirrors.

**Daily Life Cycles**:
- Wake up with no memory of who they are
- Find evidence of their life (photos, journals, clothes that fit)
- Spend the day rediscovering their existence
- Go to sleep and reset completely

### The Memory Thieves
Entities that exist by stealing memories from visitors, the only way they can maintain coherent existence. They appear as hollow-eyed humans who speak in borrowed experiences.

**Memory Thief** (CR 8)
- AC: 16 (uncertainty field)
- HP: 95 (11d8+44)
- **Memory Drain**: Touch steals 1d6 memories (specific events chosen by DM)
- **Identity Theft**: Can perfectly mimic anyone whose memories they've stolen
- **Antimemetic Cloak**: Automatically forgotten if not actively observed

### The Persistent Ones
Rare individuals who somehow remember Memoriam exists. They're cursed with being the only ones who know about an entire continent, dismissed as delusional by everyone else.

**The Curse of Knowing**:
- Can never convince others Memoriam exists
- Evidence they gather disappears
- Journals self-censor mentions of the continent
- Eventually doubt their own memories

## Economic Paradoxes

### The Impossible Trade
Ships arrive at ports with cargo they don't remember loading, payment for goods they don't recall selling. Memoriam's economy functions through unconscious transactions.

**Trade Goods That Don't Exist**:
- **Forgotten Pearls**: Valuable but no one remembers why
- **Void Glass**: Windows to nowhere
- **Uncertainty Ore**: Metal that might be there
- **Never-fruit**: Nourishing food that was never grown

### The Bank of Unrecorded Wealth
A financial institution that manages accounts no one remembers opening, paying interest on deposits that were never made, funding ventures that won't be remembered.

## Environmental Hazards

### Memory Storms
Violent tempests of concentrated forgetting that can erase people from history:
- **Stage 1**: Forget why you came here
- **Stage 2**: Forget who you came with
- **Stage 3**: Forget your own name
- **Stage 4**: Forget you exist
- **Stage 5**: Never existed at all

### Paradox Zones
Areas where the antimemetic field conflicts with reality:
- Places that are remembered but don't exist
- Events that happened but never occurred
- People who are present but were never born
- Conversations happening in reverse causality

## Quest Hooks

### "The Persistent Map"
A map that shows Memoriam has appeared, resisting the antimemetic field. Following it leads to the source of the forgetting—and possibly a way to end it.

### "The Remembered Child"
A child from Memoriam somehow exists in regular memory. Everyone remembers them, but they remember nothing. They might be the key to understanding the continent.

### "The Accumulating Evidence"
The party keeps finding evidence of previous visits to Memoriam they don't remember. Journal entries in their handwriting, contracts they signed, even scars from battles they never fought.

## Hidden Truths

### The Origin of Forgetting
Memoriam was deliberately forgotten to contain something. Theories include:
- A god that should not be worshipped
- The true history of the Drowning
- A plague of pure information
- The location of the Depth Mother's heart

### The Memory Sink Theory
Memoriam might be where all forgotten things go—every lost memory, abandoned thought, and discarded identity accumulates here, creating a massive psychic landfill.

### The Protection Protocol
Perhaps Memoriam forgets visitors to protect them. Those who fully remember the continent go catastrophically insane from knowledge they weren't meant to have.

## Integration with Campaigns

### The Parliament of Shadows
Several Shadow Senators come from Memoriam, explaining why no one remembers electing them. They're trying to make the rest of Aquabyssos forgettable too.

### The Memory Wars
Memoriam is the ultimate weapon—an entire continent that can be strategically forgotten and remembered to reshape history.

### Connection to Aethermoor
The eighth shard, the one no one remembers, is hidden in Memoriam. It's the Shard of Forgetting, and it's been actively erasing itself from the prophecy.

## DM Notes

### Running Memoriam
- Give players incomplete information constantly
- Have them find evidence of actions they don't remember taking
- NPCs should be confused about their own existence
- Use flashbacks to events that never happened

### Memory Management
- Keep secret notes about what happens in Memoriam
- Reveal these events later as "discovered evidence"
- Have players make WIS saves to remember crucial information
- Create paradoxes where players must act on information they've forgotten

### The Ultimate Mystery
The truth about Memoriam should remain uncertain. Even the DM shouldn't be entirely sure what's real there. Is it:
- A collective hallucination?
- A reality-wide glitch?
- A divine punishment?
- A protective measure?
- All simultaneously true?

*"This journal entry is the only proof I have that Memoriam exists. By the time you read this, you'll have forgotten where you found it. By the time I reread it, I'll have forgotten I wrote it. But somewhere, nowhere, and everywhere, an entire continent of people lives, dies, and forgets, and forgetting, forgets to forget."*
