## Overview

Beneath the major cities of [[Aethermoor lies a vast network of ancient siege tunnels, testament to the brutal military engineering of the [Continental War]]. These massive underground passages once carried armies, siege engines, and supplies directly beneath enemy fortifications, allowing for devastating surprise attacks that changed the course of history.

Built primarily during the Third Continental War by the allied forces of what would become [[Port Meridian, [Crystalhaven]], and [[Ironhold, these tunnels represent some of the most ambitious military engineering projects ever undertaken. Though many sections have collapsed or been deliberately sealed, enough remain active to serve modern purposes - both legitimate and otherwise.

### The Great Siege Campaign

The tunnel network was conceived during the siege of the ancient fortress-city of Drakmoor, when conventional siege tactics proved inadequate against the city's crystal-enhanced defenses. [[Lord Commander Gareth|[Lord Commander Gareth]] Steelborn]]'s engineering corps, working with dwarven miners from [[Ironhold and crystal-mages from [Crystalhaven]], spent three years excavating the first major tunnel complex.

The success of the Drakmoor operation led to an arms race of underground warfare, with cities across [[Aethermoor both digging new offensive tunnels and counter-mining defensive networks. By the war's end, over 200 miles of tunnels crisscrossed the continent.

### Construction Methods

The ancient engineers employed three distinct tunnel types:

**Crystal-Carved Passages**: [Crystalhaven]] mages used focused energy beams to melt through solid rock
**Dwarven-Dug Networks**: [[Ironhold miners created structurally superior passages using traditional methods
**Hybrid Constructions**: Combined magical reinforcement with conventional excavation

### Major Active Sections

**The Port Meridian Approach**
- 15-mile tunnel connecting to [Harbor District]]
- Originally designed to bypass coastal defenses
- Now used by [[Thieves Guild|[[02 Worldbuilding/[Groups]]/Thieves Guild]] and smuggling operations
- Multiple branching passages lead to strategic points throughout the city

**The Crystalhaven Underlayers**
- Complex web of tunnels beneath [[garden
- Many passages still contain active crystal formations
- Used by the [[Merchant|[Merchant]]'s Covet]] for secure transport
- Connects to the ancient [[Royal Vault systems

**The Ironhold Deep Roads**
- Most structurally sound section of the entire network
- Reinforced with traditional dwarven engineering techniques
- Actively maintained by [Ironhold]] military forces
- Contains hidden weapon caches and emergency supplies

**The Sylvanheart Rootways**
- Unique hybrid tunnels that incorporated living tree roots
- Self-maintaining through magical symbiosis
- Guarded by [[Sylvanheart druids and rangers
- Provides covert access to multiple forest strongholds

### Tunnel Navigation

**Intelligence (Investigation) **DC 16****: Navigate without getting lost
**Wisdom (Survival) **DC 14****: Find safe camping spots and avoid unstable areas
**Strength (Athletics) **DC 18****: Traverse collapsed sections

### [Environmental Hazards]]

**Unstable Sections**: Dexterity save **DC 15** or trigger partial collapse (`dice: 2d10` bludgeoning damage)
**Crystal Resoce**: Constitution save **DC 16** in magical sections or be stunned for 1 round
**Stagt Air**: Constitution save **DC 12** every hour or gain one level of [[Exhaustion
**Flooding**: Seasonal water levels can trap unwary explorers

### The War Room Nexus

*Central command center where the tunnel campaigns were coordinated*
- Contains detailed maps of the entire network
- Magical communication devices still functional
- Guarded by ancient [The Crystal Guard Elite]]
- Repository of [[Military Intelligence from the Continental Wars

### The Bone Gardens

*Mass burial chamber for tunnel warfare casualties*
- Restless spirits of ancient soldiers
- Undead guardians protecting buried treasures
- Connection point for multiple tunnel branches
- Source of necromantic energy affecting nearby passages

### The Flooding Gates

*Ancient lock system controlling underground rivers*
- Can flood or drain large sections of tunnels
- Controlled from hidden mechanisms
- Strategic chokepoints for tunnel control
- Connected to [Port Meridian]] sewage systems

### The Arsenal Vaults

*Hidden weapon storage chambers*
- Ancient siege engines stored in preservation chambers
- Magical weapons from the Continental Wars
- Experimental crystal-powered devices
- Trapped and warded against intrusion

### Legitimate Activities

**Emergency Routes**: Official evacuation tunnels for major cities
**Diplomatic Channels**: Secure passage for sensitive negotiations
**Military Logistics**: Moving troops and supplies without detection
**Archaeological Research**: Study of ancient engineering techniques

### Illicit Operations

**Smuggling Networks**: Avoiding customs and tariffs
**Criminal Hideouts**: Base of operations for organized crime
**Political Conspiracies**: Secret meetings beyond government surveillance
**Treasure Hunting**: Looting ancient military caches

## Current Threats & Inhabitants

**Ancient Guardians**: Crystal golems and mechanical constructs still defending key areas
**[[Organization|Criminal [Organizations]]**: [[Thieves Guild|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/Thieves Guild members and smuggling rings
**Tunnel Rats**: Survivors who've adapted to permanent underground life
**Undead Soldiers**: Spirits of those who died in the tunnels during the wars
**Aberrant Creatures**: Things that have crept up from deeper caves
**Rogue Archaeologists**: Scholars seeking forbidden military knowledge

## Quest Hooks

1. **The Lost Legion**: An entire military unit disappeared in the tunnels decades ago - survivors may still be alive
2. **The Smuggler's Map**: Characters acquire a partial tunnel map leading to a massive weapon cache
3. **Underground Politics**: A secret meeting between city leaders is disrupted by tunnel collapse
4. **The Ancient Signal**: Old communication devices activate, suggesting someone is operating from deep within the network
5. **Tunnel War**: Two criminal organizations fight for control over lucrative smuggling routes
6. **The Collapsing Network**: Strategic tunnel sections are failing, threatening to sink entire city districts
7. **Archaeological Expedition**: Characters escort researchers investigating newly discovered tunnel sections
8. **The Deep Intruder**: Something from below is using the tunnels to infiltrate surface locations
9. **Military Secrets**: [Evidence]] of current military operations hidden in supposedly abandoned passages
10. **The Tunnel King**: A [[Mysterious Figure has taken control of large sections and demands tribute from users

### Military Value
