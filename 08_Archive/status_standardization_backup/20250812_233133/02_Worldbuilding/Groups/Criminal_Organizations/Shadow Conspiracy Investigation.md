# Shadow Conspiracy Investigation
*The Light Brigade, Truth Seekers, Those Who Remember*

## Overview
The Shadow Conspiracy Investigation (SCI) is a covert intelligence organization dedicated to uncovering, documenting, and ultimately dismantling [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Shadow Conspiracy|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/The Shadow Conspiracy]]. Born from the growing suspicions of several high-ranking officials who noticed inconsistencies in their colleagues' behavior, the SCI operates in complete secrecy, knowing that discovery would mean certain death or replacement. They are the thin line of light standing against the encroaching darkness that threatens to consume all of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]].

Investigator Supreme Lucian Brightwater is aging and the stress of leading the resistance is taking its toll. The Inner Circle is quietly competing for succession, with different visions for the organization's future creating tension.

### The Compromise Debate
**Negotiation vs. Elimination**
Some SCI members believe the shadow conspiracy could be negotiated with, particularly shadows who have developed genuine care for their replaced originals. Others view all shadows as irredeemable enemies.

### The Post-Victory Plan
**After the Conspiracy Falls**
Members debate what should happen to defeated shadows. Options range from exile to integration to elimination, with passionate advocates for each approach creating ideological divisions.

### The Double Agent Network
**The Gray Operatives**
A secret sub-organization within SCI consists of members who have allowed themselves to be "recruited" by the shadow conspiracy. Their dual loyalty creates security risks and ethical dilemmas.

### The Extremist Faction
**The Purifiers**
A radical wing led by survivors of replacement attempts advocates for immediate violent action against all suspected shadows, regardless of evidence or collateral damage.
