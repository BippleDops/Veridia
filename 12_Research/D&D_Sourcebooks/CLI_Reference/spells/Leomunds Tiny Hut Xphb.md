# Leomund's Tiny Hut
*3rd-level, Evocation (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Self (10-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a crystal bead)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

A 10-foot [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] springs into existence around you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell fails when you cast it if the [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] isn't big enough to fully encapsulate all creatures in its area.

Creatures and objects within the [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] when you cast the spell can move through it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells of level 3 or lower can't be cast through it, and the effects of such spells can't extend into it.

The atmosphere inside the [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside. Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to have [[dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] or [[darkness xphb|Darkness]] (no action required). The [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] is opaque from the outside and of any color you choose, but it's transparent from the inside.

The spell ends early if you leave the [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] or if you cast it again.

**Classes**: [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Fighter (Eldritch Knight)]]; [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-evoker-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Wizard (Evoker)]]; [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]; [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Rogue (Arcane Trickster)]]; [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Bard (College of Lore)]]; [[list-spells-classes-wizard|Wizard]]
