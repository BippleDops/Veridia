**Wilderness Chase Complications**

`dice: [](wilderness-chase-complications-xdmg.md#^wilderness-chase-complications)`

| dice: 1d12 | Complication |
|------------|--------------|
| 1 | You pass through a [[swarm of insects xmm|Swarm of Insects]] (see the "Monster Manual", with the DM choosing whichever kind of insects makes the most sense). The swarm uses one of its actions, targeting you. |
| 2 | A stream or ravine blocks your path. Make a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (your choice) to cross the impediment. On a failed save, the impediment counts as 10 feet of [[difficult terrain xphb|Difficult Terrain]] for you. |
| 3 | Make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, blowing sand, dirt, ash, snow, or pollen causes you to have the [[conditions#Blinded|Blinded]] condition until the end of your turn. While you are Blinded in this way, your Speed is halved. |
| 4 | A sudden drop catches you by surprise. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to navigate the impediment. On a failed save, you fall 10 feet. |
| 5 | Your path takes you near a patch of "razorvine" (see ""Hazards"" in this chapter). Make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or use 10 feet of movement (your choice) to avoid the razorvine. On a failed save, you take `d10` Slashing damage. |
| 6 | A creature native to the area notices you. (The DM chooses a creature appropriate for the terrain.) Make a DC 10 Wisdom or Charisma saving throw (your choice). On a failed save, the creature joins the chase, with you as its quarry. |
| 7â€“12 | There is no complication. |
