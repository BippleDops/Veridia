--- # Wall of Fire

*4th-level, Evocation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of charcoal)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration. When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking`5d8`Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals`5d8`Fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by`d8`for each spell slot level above 4. **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[List Spells Classes Light Domain Xphb]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 338.
