## Description
Built by the craftsmen of exotic Calimshan, these round-backed instruments have become a fixture in royal courts as far north as Sundabar. Our lutes contain doubled strings for a fuller sound. The pegs allow for easy tuning, and the round back rests most comfortably against the stomach. Chitarrone: 50 gp; theorbo: 45 gp; mandora: 40 gp; common: 35 gp.
