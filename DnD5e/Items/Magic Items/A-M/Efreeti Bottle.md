## Description

This painted brass [[Glass Bottle|bottle]] weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless [[17 - Damage and Healing|fire]], and an [[Efreeti|efreeti]] appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

The first time the [[Glass Bottle|bottle]] is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.

| **d100** | **Effect**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| 01–10    | The [[Efreeti]] attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the [[Glass Bottle]] loses its magic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 11–90    | The [[Efreeti]] serves you for 1 hour, doing as you [[Command]]. Then the efreeti returns to the [[Glass Bottle]], and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can’t be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. |
| 91–100   | The [[Efreeti]] can cast the [[Wish]] spell three times for you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or after 1 hour, and the [[Glass Bottle]] loses its magic.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
