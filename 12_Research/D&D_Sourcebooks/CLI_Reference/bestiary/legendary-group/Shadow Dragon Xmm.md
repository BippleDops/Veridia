# Shadow Dragon

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region around a shadow dragon's lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Negative Energy Suffusion.** Whenever a creature within 1 mile of the lair regains [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] from a spell, it subtracts `d10` from the number of [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] regained.  
- **Stifling Shadows.** Within 1 mile of the lair, effects that normally create [[bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]] instead create [[dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]], and creatures there have [[advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on Dexterity ([[skills#Stealth|Stealth]]) checks.  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
