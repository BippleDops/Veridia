Ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can take a [[Action Xphb]] to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]], and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.

Uneaten berries disappear when the spell ends.
