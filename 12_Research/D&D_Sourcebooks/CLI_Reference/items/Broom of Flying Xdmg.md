# Broom of Flying
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/broom-of-flying.webp#right)

This wooden broom functions like a mundane broom until you stand astride it and take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to make it hover beneath you, at which time it can be ridden in the air. It has a [[fly speed xphb|Fly Speed]] of 50 feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its [[fly speed xphb|Fly Speed]] becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land or when you're no longer riding it.

As a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you name the location and are familiar with it. The broom comes back to you when you take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action and use a command word if the broom is still within 1 mile of you.
