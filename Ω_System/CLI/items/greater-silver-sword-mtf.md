# Greater Silver Sword
*Weapon ([greatsword](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/greatsword-xphb.md)), legendary (requires attunement by a creature that has psionic ability)*  
![](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/img/greater-silver-sword.webp#right)

- **Damage**: 2d6 slashing
- **Properties**: [Heavy](/3-Mechanics/CLI/item-properties.md#Heavy), [Two-Handed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/item-properties.md#Two-Handed)
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

This magic weapon grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While you hold the sword, you have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws, you are immune to being [charmed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed), and you have resistance to psychic damage. In addition, if you score a critical hit with it against a creature's astral body, you can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage.
