# Consequence Chain Tracking System

## Overview
This system tracks how character actions and campaign events create cascading effects across different levels of society and time periods.

## Scope Levels

### Personal Consequences
- **Immediate**: Character-focused effects visible within scenes
- **Short-term**: Individual and family impacts over sessions
- **Long-term**: Character legacy and bloodline effects

### Local Consequences  
- **Immediate**: Community-level changes within adventures
- **Short-term**: Settlement and regional adaptations
- **Long-term**: Cultural and economic transformation

### Regional Consequences
- **Immediate**: Province-wide reactions to events
- **Short-term**: Political and economic restructuring
- **Long-term**: Regional character and identity evolution

### World Consequences
- **Immediate**: International diplomatic and economic responses
- **Short-term**: Global system adaptations
- **Long-term**: Civilizational development paths

## Timing Framework

### Immediate (Minutes to Hours)
- Direct participants and witnesses affected
- Often reversible with quick action
- High emotional intensity, low complexity

### Short-term (Days to Months)
- Extended networks and communities involved
- Difficult but possible to reverse
- Medium complexity, adaptation required

### Long-term (Years to Decades)
- Entire societies and future generations
- Permanent or requiring massive effort to change
- High complexity, systemic transformation

## Butterfly Effect Multipliers

### Minor Action Cascades
Small personal choices with unexpectedly large consequences

### Social Network Cascades
Interpersonal moments that spread through relationship networks

### Information Cascades
Knowledge sharing that amplifies through communication systems

### Resource Cascades
Economic actions that reshape larger market and social systems

## Tracking Methods

### Immediate Response Log
- Who reacts and how
- Visible changes in environment/situation
- Stakeholder positions and statements

### Network Effect Map
- Which relationships are affected
- How information and influence spread
- Key connection points and influencers

### Timeline Projection
- When different effects are likely to manifest
- Critical decision points for intervention
- Long-term trend trajectories

### Mitigation/Amplification Analysis
- Ways consequences could be reduced or prevented
- Conditions that might intensify effects
- Intervention opportunities and costs

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Assess Scope**: Determine primary level of impact
2. **Map Immediate**: Identify direct effects and reactions  
3. **Project Timeline**: Estimate when consequences will manifest
4. **Track Networks**: Follow how effects spread through relationships
5. **Identify Interventions**: Find opportunities to modify outcomes
6. **Document Evolution**: Record how consequences actually develop
