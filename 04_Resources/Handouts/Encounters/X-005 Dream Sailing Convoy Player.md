# Dream Sailing Convoy

Voices weave in the dark. The whole fleet seems to move as one, drawn along a song no chart can show.

What you notice
- Sleepy smiles on tired faces
- A rhythm under the deck

What you can try
- Add your voice to the song
- Keep watch at the edges

Possible outcomes
- The night shortens under your feet
- The song falters
- A dream gets loose
