# Unarmed Strike
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 377. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

Instead of using a weapon to make a melee attack, you can use a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow. In game terms, this is an Unarmed Strike—a melee attack that involves you using your body to damage, grapple, or shove a target within 5 feet of you.

Whenever you use your Unarmed Strike, choose one of the following options for its effect.

## Damage

You make an attack roll against the target. Your bonus to the roll equals your Strength modifier plus your [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb|Proficiency Bonus]]. On a hit, the target takes Bludgeoning damage equal to 1 plus your Strength modifier.

## Grapple

The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/saving-throw-xphb|saving throw]] (it chooses which), or it has the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Grappled|Grappled]] condition. The DC for the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/saving-throw-xphb|saving throw]] and any escape attempts equals 8 plus your Strength modifier and [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb|Proficiency Bonus]]. This grapple is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you and if you have a hand free to grab it.

## Shove

The target must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/saving-throw-xphb|saving throw]] (it chooses which), or you either push it 5 feet away or cause it to have the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Prone|Prone]] condition. The DC for the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/saving-throw-xphb|saving throw]] equals 8 plus your Strength modifier and [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb|Proficiency Bonus]]. This shove is possible only if the target is no more than one size larger than you.
