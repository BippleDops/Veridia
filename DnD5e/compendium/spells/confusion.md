# Confusion
*4th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, three nut shells
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.

An affected target can't take reactions and must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.

**Confusion Behavior**

| dice: d10 | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
|  | The creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn't take an action this turn. |
|  | The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn. |
|  | The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn. |
|  | The creature can act and move normally. |

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that target.

**Classes**: Bard, Cleric (Knowledge), Druid, Paladin (Oathbreaker), Rogue (Arcane Trickster), Sorcerer, Wizard
