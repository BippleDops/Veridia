# Fire-Casting Statue
*Generic Hazard*  

When a creature moves onto this trap's pressure plate for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, a nearby statue exhales a 15-foot [Cone](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb.md) of magical flame. The statue can look like anything, such as a dragon or a wizard. Each creature in the Cone must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (`2d10`) Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Detect and Disarm

A [Detect Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic-xphb.md) spell reveals an aura of Evocation magic around the statue. As a [Search](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Search) action, a creature within 5 feet of the statue can examine it and make a DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Perception)) check, detecting a tiny glyph on the statue on a successful check. Once the glyph is found, a character can take a [Study](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Study) action to examine it and make a DC 15 Intelligence ([Arcana](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Arcana)) check, ascertaining that the glyph means "fire" on a successful check. As an action, a character can use a sharp tool to deface the glyph, which disarms the trap.

As a [Search](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Search) action, a creature can examine the section of floor that forms the pressure plate and make a DC 15 Wisdom ([Perception](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Perception)) check, detecting the pressure plate on a successful check. Wedging an [Iron Spike](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/iron-spikes-xphb.md) or similar object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from triggering.

## At Higher Levels

You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing the damage and the area of effect, as shown in the following table.

| Levels | Fire Damage | Area of Effect |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| 5–10 | 22 (`4d10`) | 30-foot Cone |
| 11–16 | 55 (`10d10`) | 60-foot Cone |
| 17–20 | 99 (`18d10`) | 120-foot Cone |
