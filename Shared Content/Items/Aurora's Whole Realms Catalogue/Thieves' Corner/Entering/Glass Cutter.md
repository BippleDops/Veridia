## Description
Why spend precious minutes (if not longer) picking a rusty and complex lock when a window lies in reach? The diamond head of this glass-cutter is guaranteed to score even the thickest and most refined glass. Merely plant the sap-spong in the center of a pane of glass and score a circle around it. A gentle tap creates a hole from mouse-size to person-size. (2 gp)

## Additional Details
Requires Dex check at -2; failure means the cut section of window slipped and shattered
