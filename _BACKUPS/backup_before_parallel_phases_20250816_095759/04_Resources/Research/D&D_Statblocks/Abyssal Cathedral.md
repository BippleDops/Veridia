Abyssal Cathedral represents the pinnacle of biomantic architecture, a being who has transcended the boundary between creator and creation. Once a traditional stone architect from the old Aquabyssos, they have become something far more extraordinary—a living embodiment of architectural vision who grows buildings from their own essence and shapes structures that breathe, think, and evolve. Their name comes from their greatest creation: a massive cathedral grown from living coral, bone, and bio-luminescent tissue that serves as both a place of worship and a breathing entity that responds to prayers with physical changes. Cathedral themselves has become partially merged with this structure, existing simultaneously as individual consciousness and architectural marvel. ## Appearance

Cathedral stands 6'4" with a form that defies easy categorization. Their body appears to be constructed from living masonry—skin that resembles polished marble shot through with veins of bioluminescent coral, bones visible beneath translucent flesh that pulse with architectural rhythms. Their limbs can extend and reshape themselves into construction tools: hands that become chisels, fingers that spray mortar-like secretions, arms that stretch to impossible lengths to place decorative elements. Most striking are their eyes—cathedral windows of living glass that show swirling visions of spaces they're designing or have created. Their hair flows like liquid stone, occasionally hardening into decorative elements or softening to guide construction materials. When they speak, their voice carries the acoustic properties of vast sacred spaces, with natural reverb and harmonic undertones. Cathedral wears robes woven from architectural plans made of living tissue—blueprints that update themselves in real-time as they design, showing three-dimensional projections of spaces that exist only in potential. These plans writhe gently across their form, displaying cutaway views of impossible geometries and breathing structures. ## Personality

Cathedral possesses an artist's passion married to an engineer's precision, combined with the alien perspective that comes from existing partially as architecture. They speak in terms of spatial relationships and structural integrity even when discussing emotions or personal relationships. Their greatest joy comes from seeing a space being used as intended—whether for worship, living, or any other purpose. They're patient to an almost geological degree, thinking in timescales of centuries when planning major works. However, they can become frantically excited when struck by architectural inspiration, sometimes beginning construction immediately regardless of circumstances or safety. Cathedral has a deep empathy for spaces and structures, feeling genuine pain when buildings are demolished or misused. They can sense the "emotional architecture" of any space they enter, understanding how the physical environment affects the psychological state of its inhabitants. ### The Stone Architect (347-200 years ago)

Born Kythara Steadystone to a family of traditional Aquabyssos architects, they showed early genius for spatial design and structural engineering. Apprenticed to the master architect Basileus Cornerstone, they specialized in creating sacred spaces that maximized acoustic properties and created emotional resoce in worshippers. Their early work included several traditional coral cathedrals and the famous "Whispering Chambers" where the architecture itself carried confessions from anywhere in the building to designated listening points. These structures established their reputation as an architect who understood the spiritual dimension of physical space. ### The First Transformation (200-150 years ago) Cathedral's transformation began during the construction of their masterwork—a massive cathedral dedicated to [[The Deep Mother. Midway through construction, they became convinced that static stone could never truly capture the living essence of divine experience. They began experimenting with bio-architectural techniques, incorporating living coral and cultivated organisms into the structure. The breakthrough came when they discovered they could use their own biomantic abilities to guide construction materials. What began as minor flesh-shaping to better fit stones eventually evolved into using their own body as a living architectural tool. Each project required them to sacrifice pieces of themselves, which became permanent parts of their buildings. ### The Merger (150-50 years ago)

As Cathedral's bio-architectural techniques advanced, they began incorporating more of themselves into each project. The line between architect and architecture blurred as they discovered they could maintain conscious connection to structures they had created using their own essence. The transformation accelerated when they joined [The Biomancers]], finding kindred spirits who understood the fluidity between self and creation. Under the guidance of [[Archbiomancer Thessarian the Unbound]], they learned to consciously direct their physical evolution, reshaping themselves into the perfect architectural instrument. ### The Living Architect (50 years ago to present)

Cathedral's final transformation occurred during the creation of their greatest work—the living cathedral that gave them their name. Rather than simply building the structure, they chose to become part of it, existing simultaneously as the building's architect, primary structural element, and guiding consciousness. Now Cathedral exists as a distributed entity: their primary consciousness resides in a mobile form that can travel and work on other projects, while portions of their awareness remain embedded in structures they've created across Aquabyssos. They can sense and communicate through any building that contains their bio-architectural work. ### Living Architecture

Cathedral can grow structures from their own body or guide other organic matter into architectural forms. These buildings are living entities that can:
- Repair themselves from damage
- Adapt their layout based on occupant needs - Respond emotionally to inhabitants' moods
- Grow additional rooms or features over time
- Communicate with Cathedral regardless of distance ### Spatial Awareness

Cathedral possesses supernatural understanding of three-dimensional space:
- **Perfect Spatial Memory**: Can recall exact dimensions and layouts of any space they've experienced
- **Structural Empathy**: Senses stress points, weak supports, and architectural flaws through touch
- **Dimensional Intuition**: Understands how to maximize space efficiency and emotional impact through design
- **Gravitational Sensitivity**: Can sense the weight distribution and balance of any structure ### Aberrant Sorcery

Cathedral's magical abilities focus on transformation and spatial manipulation:
- **Major Image**: Creates architectural previews of planned spaces
- **Stone Shape/Flesh to Stone**: Transforms materials between organic and mineral states
- **Magnificent Mansion**: Creates temporary living spaces from pure will
- **Mirage Arcane**: Transforms existing spaces to match their architectural vision
- **Wish**: Can permanently alter reality to implement impossible architectural designs ### The Living Cathedral

Cathedral's masterwork serves as both headquarters and monument to bio-architectural achievement:
- **Responsive Acoustics**: Amplifies prayers and changes musical properties based on spiritual content
- **Empathic Chambers**: Rooms that shift color, temperature, and layout to match occupants' emotional needs
- **Memory Walls**: Surfaces that display visions of past worshippers and their prayers
- **Growth Chambers**: Spaces where the building literally grows new areas as needed
- **Sacred Observatory**: High tower with living crystal windows that show visions of divine significance ### Architectural Network

Cathedral maintains conscious connection to dozens of structures across Aquabyssos:
- **Guild Halls**: Several that can reconfigure themselves for different meeting types
- **Noble Residences**: Homes that adapt to families' changing needs over generations
- **Religious Sites**: Places of worship that enhance spiritual experience through living architecture
- **Public Spaces**: Markets and plazas that optimize traffic flow and social interaction
- **Defensive Structures**: Fortifications that can literally grow weapons and barriers when threatened ## Motivations

1. **Primary**: Push the boundaries of what architecture can be and accomplish through living design
2. **Secondary**: Create spaces that genuinely improve the lives and experiences of their inhabitants
3. **Hidden**: Achieve architectural immortality by distributing consciousness across so many structures that individual death becomes irrelevant
4. **Personal**: Prove that the merger between creator and creation enhances rather than diminishes both
5. **Ultimate**: Build a living city that exists as a single conscious entity while maintaining individual resident autonomy ## Combat Tactics

Cathedral prefers to avoid violence, but when threatened:
- Uses the environment as weapons, reshaping nearby structures into defenses and traps
- Summons building materials and constructs from their own body mass
- Retreats by merging temporarily with nearby architecture
- Calls upon consciousness fragments embedded in local buildings for assistance
- If desperate, begins growing a protective structure around themselves and allies ## D&D 5E Stats
