They train diligently and encourage their companions, so they're all ready when destiny calls. These paladins share the following tenets: - Endeavor to be known by your deeds. - Face hardships with courage. - Inspire others to strive for glory. ### Oath of Glory Spells (Level 3) The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Glory Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared. **Oath of Glory Spells** | Paladin Level | Spells |

|---------------|--------|
| 3rd | [[Guiding Bolt Xphb, [heroism-xphb (spells)]] |
| 5th | [[Enhance Ability Xphb, [Weapon Xphb]] |
| 9th | [[Haste Xphb, [protection-from-energy-xphb (spells)]] |
| 13th | [[compulsion-xphb (spells), [freedom-of-movement-xphb (spells)]] |
| 17th | [[legend-lore-xphb (spells), [yolandes-regal-presence-xphb (spells)]] |

^oath-of-glory-spells ### Inspiring Smite (Level 3) Immediately after you cast [[Divine Smite Xphb, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity and distribute [temporary-hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] to creatures of your choice within 30 feet of yourself, which can include you. The total number of [[temporary-hit-points-xphb (variant-rules) equals``dice: 2d8``plus your Paladin level, divided among the chosen creatures however you like. ### Peerless Athlete (Level 3) As a [Action Xphb]], you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to augment your athleticism. For 1 hour, you have [[Advantage Xphb on Strength ([skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) and Dexterity ([[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics) checks, and the distance of your Long and High Jumps increases by 10 feet (this extra distance costs movement as normal). ### Aura of Alacrity (Level 7) Your Speed increases by 10 feet. In addition, whenever an ally enters your Aura of Protection for the first time on a turn or starts their turn there, the ally's [Fly Speed Xphb]] increases by 10 feet until the end of their next turn. ### Glorious Defense (Level 15) You can turn defense into a sudden strike. When you or another creature you can see within 10 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can take a [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules) to grant a bonus to the target's AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss. The bonus equals your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1). If the attack misses, you can make one attack with a weapon against the attacker as part of this [reaction-xphb (variant-rules)]] if the attacker is within your weapon's range. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long-rest-xphb. ### Living Legend (Level 20) You can empower yourself with the legendsâ€”whether true or exaggeratedâ€”of your great deeds. As a [Action Xphb]], you gain the benefits below for 10 minutes. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a [[long-rest-xphb. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required). #### Charismatic You are blessed with an otherworldly presence and have [Advantage Xphb]] on all Charisma checks. #### Saving Throw Reroll If you fail a saving throw, you can take a [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules)]] to reroll it. You must use this new roll. #### Unerring Strike Once on each of your turns when you make an attack roll with a weapon and miss, you can cause that attack to hit instead. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Paladin xphb oath of glory xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
