- **Production Pipeline:** Large-scale parallel generation
- **Auto-Commit Service:** Automatic Git commits every 30 minutes
- **Smart Generator:** Rate-limited multi-service generation ### 3. **Generation Capabilities** #### Images (Via Stability AI + Open AI) - Portraits: High-quality character art
- Locations: Environmental concept art
- Creatures: Monster and beast designs
- Items: Magical artifacts and equipment
- Maps: Battle maps and region layouts
- Scenes: Cinematic moments #### Audio (Local Generation) - Ambient tracks: 50+ generated
- Combat music: 20+ generated
- Tavern atmospheres: 10+ generated
- Dungeon soundscapes: 20+ generated #### Text Content (Via Open AI GPT-4) - NPC descriptions with full backstories
- Quest narratives with hooks
- Location descriptions with secrets ## 📊 Current Statistics ### Asset Counts - **Portraits:** 29+ files
- **Locations:** 109+ files
- **Creatures:** 141+ files
- **Items:** 110+ files
- **Maps:** 15+ files
- **Scenes:** 36+ files
- **Audio:** 100+ tracks ### Generation Rate - **Images:** 10-20 per minute (with rate limiting)
- **Audio:** 20 tracks per batch
- **Text:** 1 piece per 3 seconds ## 🔧 Key Scripts ### Core Generators -`scripts/mega_generator.js`- Multi-service orchestrator
-`scripts/smart_generator.js`- Intelligent fallback system
-`scripts/production_pipeline.js`- Large-scale parallel generation
-`scripts/orchestrator.js`- Continuous generation loop ### Utilities -`scripts/test_all_apis.js`- API connectivity testing
-`scripts/launch_all_services.sh`- System startup
-`scripts/check_status.sh`- Quick status check
-`scripts/monitor_dashboard.sh`- Live monitoring ### Audio -`scripts/generate_audio_pack.js`- Batch audio generation
-`scripts/evaluate_audio_fit.js`- Audio quality assessment ## 🎯 Quick Commands```bash # Check system status bash scripts/check_status.sh # View live dashboard bash scripts/monitor_dashboard.sh # Generate 100 images immediately node scripts/smart_generator.js # Launch full production pipeline node scripts/production_pipeline.js # Restart all services bash scripts/launch_all_services.sh # Stop all services bash scripts/stop_all_services.sh```## 📈 Performance Optimizations 1. **Rate Limiting:** Automatic throttling to prevent API errors 2. **Fallback Strategy:** Seamless switching between services
3. **Parallel Processing:** Up to 5 concurrent generation tasks
4. **Auto-Recovery:** Services restart on failure
5. **Incremental Commits:** Regular Git backups ## 🔄 Automation Features - **Hourly Restarts:** Prevents memory leaks - **Auto-Commit:** Every 30 minutes
- **Health Monitoring:** Service status checks
- **Queue Management:** Intelligent task distribution
- **Error Recovery:** Exponential backoff on failures ## 💡 Architecture Highlights ### Service Priority 1. Stability AI (best quality, primary)
2. Open AI DALL-E (fallback for images)
3. Comfy UI (local fallback, needs setup) ### Concurrency Model - 5 parallel generation tasks
- Rate-limited API calls
- Queue-based task distribution
- Automatic load balancing ## 🚨 Known Issues 1. **Comfy UI:** Requires checkpoint configuration 2. **Unsplash:** API key needs verification
3. **Rate Limits:** Stability AI has request limits ## 📝 Notes - All generated assets are automatically organized in`04_Resources/Assets/`- Metadata is preserved in JSON files alongside assets - Git commits happen automatically to preserve work
- System designed for 24/7 operation ## 🎉 Success Metrics - **Total Assets Generated:** 500+ and growing - **API Uptime:** 95%+
