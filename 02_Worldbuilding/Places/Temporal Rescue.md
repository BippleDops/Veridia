# Temporal Rescue

*"When time itself becomes the enemy, heroes must race against eternity."*

## Overview
An emergency mission where someone important has been displaced in time by magical accident or deliberate action. Players must navigate temporal anomalies, paradoxes, and time-based hazards to rescue the victim before temporal forces strand them permanently.

## The Victim
**Princess Coral Tidesinger**: Royal heir trapped 200 years in the past
**Displacement Cause**: Experimental time magic gone wrong during ceremony
**Time Period**: Era before Aquabyssos's technological advancement
**Current Status**: Alive but creating dangerous temporal paradoxes
**Rescue Window**: 72 hours before temporal anchoring becomes permanent

## Time Magic Mechanics
**Temporal Anchoring**: People become fixed in time period after 3 days
**Paradox Stress**: Changes to past create reality distortions
**Chronological Immunity**: Rescue team protected by special enchantments
**Time Navigation**: Requires precise calculations and magical coordination
**Emergency Return**: Emergency evacuation possible but risky

## Mission Parameters
**Primary Objective**: Locate and extract Princess Coral safely
**Secondary Objective**: Minimize changes to historical timeline
**Tertiary Objective**: Gather intelligence about temporal anomaly source
**Time Limit**: 72 hours in present equals 3 months in past
**Equipment**: Temporal stabilizers, communication devices, period-appropriate gear

## Past Era Challenges
- Different political situation with ongoing territorial conflicts
- Technology gap making modern equipment suspicious
- Language differences and cultural barriers
 - Missing infrastructure and established contacts
- Hostile reactions to outsiders and strange behavior

## Temporal Hazards
**Time Storms**: Chaotic areas where past and present collide
**Paradox Zones**: Regions where timeline changes create dangerous instability
**Temporal Echoes**: Ghost-like repetitions of events from different time periods
**Chronometer Drain**: Magic that ages objects and people rapidly
**Future Bleed**: Anachronistic elements appearing in wrong time period

## Navigation Methods
**Temporal Compass**: Magical device pointing toward time displacement origin
**Historical Records**: Using knowledge of past events to predict locations
**Magical Signatures**: Tracking Princess Coral's unique magical aura
**Time Anchors**: Fixed points in timeline that provide stable reference
**Local Contacts**: Period-appropriate allies who can provide assistance

## Historical Context
**Political Situation**: Ancient kingdom at war with neighboring territories
**Social Structure**: More rigid class system than modern Aquabyssos
**Technology Level**: Pre-industrial with basic magical infrastructure
**Key Figures**: Historical persons who must not be significantly affected
**Major Events**: Important occurrences that must proceed as recorded

## Complications
- Princess creating major changes by revealing future knowledge
- Local authorities suspicious of rescue team's origins
 - Temporal anomalies affecting rescue equipment functionality
- Enemy agents from present also operating in past
- Historical figures becoming romantically involved with Princess

## Paradox Management
**Butterfly Effect**: Small changes potentially altering entire timeline
**Causal Loops**: Events that cause themselves through time travel
**Temporal Immunity**: Protection spells preventing paradox creation
**History Repair**: Methods for correcting accidental timeline changes
**Documentation**: Recording changes to assess future impact

## Extraction Methods
**Direct Retrieval**: Immediate temporal portal back to present
**Gradual Preparation**: Slowly preparing Princess for extraction
**Staged Evacuation**: Multiple trips to minimize temporal stress
**Emergency Abort**: Rapid escape if mission becomes impossible
**Temporal Camouflage**: Hiding extraction within historical events

## Opposition Forces
**Temporal Guardians**: Entities protecting timeline integrity
**Historical Enemies**: Past era threats that complicate mission
**Paradox Manifestations**: Physical representations of timeline damage
**Enemy Time Travelers**: Opponents seeking to exploit temporal crisis
**Chronological Immune System**: Universe's response to timeline damage

## Equipment and Preparation
**Period Costumes**: Clothing appropriate to historical era
**Language Preparation**: Knowledge of archaic speech patterns
**Historical Briefing**: Understanding of past era's politics and culture
**Temporal Stabilizers**: Devices preventing accidental timeline changes
**Emergency Protocols**: Plans for various failure scenarios

## Success Conditions
**Complete Success**: Princess rescued with minimal timeline impact
**Partial Success**: Princess rescued but some historical changes remain
**Minimal Success**: Princess found but extraction delayed or complicated
**Failure**: Princess remains trapped or timeline severely damaged
**Catastrophic Failure**: Rescue team also trapped or timeline destroyed

## Consequences and Rewards
**Temporal Knowledge**: Understanding of time magic and its applications
**Royal Gratitude**: Permanent favor from saved Princess and royal family
**Historical Artifacts**: Items obtained from past era with modern value
**Time Magic Items**: Equipment designed for temporal operations
**Experience Points**: 4,000-7,000 XP based on execution quality

## Long-term Impact
**Timeline Stability**: How well historical continuity was preserved
**Political Consequences**: Changes affecting current government structure
**Technological Development**: Acceleration or delay of certain discoveries
**Personal Relationships**: Modern consequences of past era interactions
**Temporal Expertise**: Team becomes known for time-related problem solving

## Adventure Hooks
1. Temporal accident occurs during important ceremony
2. Enemy deliberately displaces important person in time
3. Characters witness temporal anomaly requiring investigation
4. Time traveler from future warns of impending temporal crisis

## Moral Dimensions
- Ethics of changing the past to save one person
- Responsibility for consequences of temporal interference
- Value of individual life versus historical integrity
 - Right to information about future events
- Obligations to people encountered in past era

## Research Requirements
**Historical Study**: Learning about target time period
**Temporal Theory**: Understanding time magic principles
**Magical Preparation**: Acquiring protection spells and equipment
**Intelligence Gathering**: Information about displacement circumstances
**Contingency Planning**: Preparing for various failure scenarios

## DM Notes
