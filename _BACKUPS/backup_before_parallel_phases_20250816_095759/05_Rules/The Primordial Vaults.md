## Overview

Deep beneath [[Aquabyssos|[Aquabyssos]] [[World Overview]], older than the [[Drowned civilizations above, lie the Primordial Vaults - a massive complex of chambers and passages that predate human civilization. Built by unknown hands for unclear purposes, the vaults contain horrors, treasures, and answers to questions that should never be asked. The architecture defies physics, with gravity, [Time]], and space functioning irregularly.

### [[The Threshold Gates (8000 feet)

Seven massive doors, each requiring different keys or rituals to open. [Vault Keeper Eternal]] guards the entrance, neither alive nor dead, speaking only in riddles about "the necessity of drowning."

### The Hall of Untime

Corridor where time flows backward, forward, and sideways simultaneously. Those who enter may emerge younger, older, or multiplied into [[Temporal Echoes. [Chronomancer Paradox]] exists here in seventeen versions of himself.

### The Genesis Chambers

Laboratories containing failed experiments in creating life. Twisted proto-creatures still writhe in crystalline tanks. [[The First Failure, a sentient mistake, pleads for death or freedom.

### The Inverse Cathedral

A cathedral built upside-down, where prayers spoken become curses and holy water burns like acid. [Anti Priest us]] conducts backwards sermons to an congregation of shadows.

### The Memory Core

Central chamber containing crystallized memories of the world's creation. Touching them grants knowledge but steals personal memories in exchange. [[The Forgotten One dwells here, made entirely of stolen memories.

### The Deepest Lock

The final chamber, sealed with thirteen locks, each key hidden throughout Aquabyssos. Behind it lies something that [Great Drownin]] was meant to keep imprisoned.

### The Creation Tablets

Stone tablets describing how to create and destroy worlds. Written in a language that damages the mind to read.

### The First Key

Master key that allegedly opens any lock in existence, including metaphysical ones like death or fate.

### The Unwater

Liquid that undoes [[The Drowning wherever it touches, but spreads madness with its use.

### The Original Sin

Physical manifestation of the first wrongdoing, touching it reveals your worst nature.

### The Cage of Gods

Empty prison that once held deities. Their escape may have triggered the drowning.

### Gravity Wells

Areas where gravity pulls in impossible directions, creating Escher-like navigation challenges.

### Temporal Storms

Violent distortions aging or reversing anything caught within.

### Reality Bleeds

[Places]] where other dimensions leak through, bringing alien geometries and entities.

### Memory Hurricanes

Psychic storms that scramble memories and personalities of those caught within.

### The Void Pools

Black water that doesn't reflect anything - falling in erases you from history.
