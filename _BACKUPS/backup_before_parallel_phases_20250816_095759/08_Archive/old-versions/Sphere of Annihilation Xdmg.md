--- # Sphere of Annihilation

*Wondrous item, legendary* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/sphere-of-annihilation.webp#right) This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it. The sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an Artifact is susceptible to damage from a Sphere of Annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn't wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes``dice: 8d10``Force damage. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Controlling the Sphere A Sphere of Annihilation is stationary until someone takes control of it. If you are within 60 feet of a sphere, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic action to make a **DC 25** Intelligence ([skills#Arcana|Arcana]]) check. On a successful check, you control the sphere until the start of your next turn, and if it was under another creature's control, that creature loses control of the sphere. On a failed check, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you in a straight line. While in control of the sphere, you can take a [[Action Xphb to cause it to move in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). Any creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a **DC 19** Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking``dice: 8d10``Force damage. A creature reduced to 0 [hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] by this damage is obliterated, leaving its possessions behind but no other physical remains. ## Sphere Interactions If the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal (such as that created by the [[gate-xphb (spells)]] spell) or an extradimensional space (such as that within a Portable Hole), the DM determines randomly what happens using the following table.`dice: [](sphere-of-annihilation-xdmg.md#^1-result)`| dice: `dice: 1d100` | Result |

|-------------|--------|
| 01-50 | The sphere is destroyed. |
| 51-85 | The sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space. |
| 86-00 | A spatial rift sends the sphere and each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere to a random plane of existence. |

Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* ## Player-Facing Summary Sphere of annihilation xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of sphere of annihilation xdmg as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around sphere of annihilation xdmg. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A corpse reveals the truth about a local noble
