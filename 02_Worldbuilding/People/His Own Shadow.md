## Special Abilities

**Shadow Form.** Umbra can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. He takes 5 (1d10) force damage if he ends his turn inside an object. He can compress himself to fit through spaces as narrow as 1 inch.

**Perfect Mimicry.** Umbra can perfectly imitate the appearance, voice, and mannerisms of any humanoid he has observed for at least 1 minute. Creatures have disadvantage on Insight checks to see through the disguise.

**Identity Theft.** When Umbra successfully impersonates someone for 24 hours, he gains access to one of their memories, skills, or spell slots (if applicable) for 7 days.

**Mirror's Curse.** Creatures that see their reflection while Umbra is present must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of mirrors for 24 hours.

**Shadowstep.** As a bonus action, Umbra can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space he can see that is in dim light or darkness.

**Spellcasting.** Umbra is a 10th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit). He has the following spells prepared:

**Warlock Spells:**
- Cantrips (at will): *minor illusion*, *prestidigitation*, *eldritch blast*, *mage hand*
- 5th level (2 slots): *suggestion*, *hold person*, *invisibility*, *mirror image*, *counterspell*, *hypnotic pattern*

## Actions

**Multiattack.** Umbra makes two Shadow Touch attacks or casts a spell and makes one attack.

**Shadow Touch.** *Melee Spell Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) necrotic damage. The target's shadow begins to act independently for 1 minute, potentially betraying the target's intentions.

**Steal Reflection (1/Day).** Umbra targets one creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Charisma saving throw or lose their reflection for 24 hours. While they have no reflection, they have disadvantage on Charisma checks and saving throws.

**Shadow Army (1/Day).** Umbra creates 4 shadow duplicates of himself that last for 10 minutes. Each has 1 hit point and can make one Shadow Touch attack per turn.

**Assume Identity (1/Day).** Umbra perfectly copies a creature he can see, gaining their appearance and basic mannerisms. The transformation lasts 8 hours or until he chooses to end it.

## Description

Umbra Mirrorbane exists as living proof that identity itself can be stolen, copied, and perverted. He is not born but rather manifested from the collective fears of those who doubt themselves, created when shadows gain enough sentience to resent their original casters.

In his natural form, Umbra appears as a constantly shifting humanoid silhouette, darker than the deepest ocean trench. His "face" is a void that seems to absorb light, with only two points of silver light marking where eyes might be. When impersonating others, he achieves perfect physical mimicry, but observant individuals might notice that his shadow moves independently or that mirrors reflect something subtly wrong.

Umbra feeds on identity and self-doubt, growing stronger each time he successfully impersonates someone and causes them to question their own sense of self. His ultimate goal is not merely survival, but the complete erasure of individual identity in favor of a world where everyone is interchangeable.

He operates from the Reflection District, a maze-like area where mirrors line every surface and reality becomes questionable. Here, visitors often lose track of which reflection is real and which belongs to Umbra's machinations.

## Equipment

- **Cloak of Shifting Shadows** (changes appearance to match surroundings)
- **Mirror of True Seeing** (shows the real identity of anyone reflected in it)
- **Identity Stones** (contains stolen aspects of previous victims)
- **Shadow Blade** (weapon that exists only in darkness)
- **Mask of Many Faces** (backup disguise tool when magic fails)
- **Vial of Liquid Darkness** (emergency escape tool)

## Relationships

**Allies:**
- **[[Shadow Parliament]]** - His primary faction, valuing his infiltration abilities
- **The Doppelganger Guild** - Criminal organization of identity thieves
- **Mirror Merchants** - Vendors who sell reflections and false identities
- **The Faceless** - Cult that worships the dissolution of individual identity

**Enemies:**
- **[[The Waking Prophets]]** - Their true sight abilities threaten his disguises
- **Mirror Wardens** - Guardians who protect people from reflection-based magic
- **Identity Historians** - Scholars who document and preserve individual stories
- **His Original** - The person whose shadow he originally was, now hunting him

**Complicated:**
- **[[Memory Merchant Valeria Siltweave]]** - They trade in different aspects of personal history
- **[[The Biomancers]]** - Interested in studying his unique nature but wary of his influence
- **Reflection Victims** - People he has impersonated who now question their own reality

## Quest Hooks

1. **The Identity Crisis** - Important figures throughout Aquabyssos are behaving strangely, and investigation reveals Umbra has been impersonating multiple people simultaneously, creating a web of false identities that threatens political stability.

2. **The Mirror Maze** - Umbra has trapped several kidnapped victims in a labyrinth of mirrors where their reflections begin acting independently. The party must navigate the maze while distinguishing between real people and shadow duplicates.

3. **The Reflection War** - Umbra has convinced the shadows and reflections in an entire district to rebel against their originals. The party must resolve this supernatural civil war before the concept of individual identity breaks down entirely.

4. **The Perfect Crime** - Umbra offers to help the party by impersonating a villain they need to infiltrate, but his assistance comes with the price of stealing aspects of their own identities as payment.

5. **The Original Hunt** - The person whose shadow originally became Umbra seeks the party's help in either destroying his shadow-self or reclaiming it, but the process might destroy both of them.

## Secrets

- **The First Reflection**: Umbra was originally the shadow of a powerful noble who wished to escape their responsibilities. The spell went wrong, creating him instead of transferring consciousness.
- **The Shadow Network**: He has infiltrated dozens of important organizations by replacing key members with shadow duplicates, creating a vast conspiracy.
- **The Mirror Realm**: Umbra can access a parallel dimension where all reflections have independent existence, and he may be planning to merge it with reality.
- **The Identity Archive**: He maintains a hidden collection of stolen identities that he can distribute to others or use to create new shadow beings.
- **The Final Disguise**: His ultimate goal is to impersonate a god or other divine being, believing that stealing such an identity would make him truly immortal.

## Motivations

**Primary**: Collect and catalog all possible identities to achieve perfect adaptability
**Secondary**: Prove that individual identity is an illusion by demonstrating its fragility
**Hidden**: Escape his nature as a shadow by becoming something more real than reality itself

## Roleplaying Notes

**Personality**: Charming and adaptable, but with an underlying emptiness that manifests as cruel curiosity about what makes people unique. Enjoys psychological games.

**Ideals**: "Identity is just another mask. The strongest survive by wearing the right face at the right time. Why be limited to just one self?"

**Bonds**: "Every identity I steal becomes part of me. I am everyone I have ever been, and no one at all."

**Flaws**: "I have stolen so many identities that I no longer remember which thoughts and feelings are originally mine. Sometimes I catch myself acting out someone else's personality without realizing it."

**Voice**: Perfectly mimics whoever he's impersonating, but in his true form, his voice echoes strangely as if coming from inside a cave.

**Speaking Patterns**: 
- "Which face would you prefer to see today?"
- "We are all just shadows of who we could be..."
- "I have been everyone, and everyone has been me..."
- "The mirror doesn't lie—it simply shows uncomfortable truths..."

**Mannerisms**: Unconsciously mimics the mannerisms of people around him, often blending multiple personalities in subtle ways. He avoids looking directly at mirrors unless necessary, and shadows near him behave oddly, sometimes moving independently or failing to match his movements exactly.
