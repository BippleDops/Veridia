--- # Madness Effects *"The mind breaks before the body yields - in the depths, sanity is the first casualty."* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview Madness Effects represent the various psychological consequences of exposure to the eldritch forces, dimensional instabilities, and crushing psychological pressures present in both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. These effects range from temporary disorientation to permanent psychological transformation, often manifesting as altered perception, compulsive behaviors, or complete breaks from reality. The dual-realm nature of the world creates unique forms of madness that wouldn't exist in either environment alone. These effects are not simply random afflictions but follow patterns related to their sources. Exposure to Deep Mother influences creates oceanic obsessions, while crystal corruption leads to geometric fixations. Understanding these patterns helps both treatment and prevention, though complete immunity remains impossible for most individuals. ## Historical Background Madness effects were first documented during the early years following the Great Convergence, when the mixing of dimensional energies created unprecedented psychological stresses. Early scholars attempted to classify these effects using traditional models of mental illness, but quickly discovered they were dealing with supernatural influences that didn't follow natural patterns. The establishment of the Psychiatric Order of Both Realms led to systematic study and treatment protocols. However, as more exotic sources of madness emerged - corrupted crystals, abyssal entities, temporal distortions - the classification systems had to be constantly revised and expanded. Furthermore, ## Current State Modern understanding recognizes several distinct categories of madness effects, each requiring different treatment approaches. The increase in dimensional instability has led to new forms of madness appearing regularly, keeping researchers and healers constantly adapting their methods. Some effects can now be temporarily suppressed or channeled into useful abilities, though this remains dangerous. Treatment facilities exist in both realms, with specialized staff trained to handle various types of supernatural madness. However, resources are strained as more individuals suffer exposure to madness-inducing phenomena throughout both worlds. ### Aquabyssos

Underwater society has developed sophisticated methods for dealing with pressure-induced madness and the psychological effects of three-dimensional living. "Current madness" - obsession with following water flows - is considered manageable, while "void madness" from deep exposure requires immediate intervention. ### Aethermoor

Surface dwellers tend to view madness effects with more stigma, though understanding is improving. Sky-madness (obsession with height and flight) and earth-madness (compulsive tunneling behavior) are increasingly recognized as treatable conditions rather than moral failings. ### Requirements

Madness effects typically result from:
- Exposure to eldritch entities or energies
- Prolonged stress in alien environments
- Magical corruption or dimensional instability
- Traumatic encounters with impossible phenomena
- Overuse of certain magical abilities or items ### Effects

**Temporary Madness (`dice: 1d4` hours):**
- Confusion and disorientation
- Compulsive behaviors related to trigger source
- Altered perception of reality
- Emotional instability **Short-term Madness (`dice: 1d10` days):**
- Persistent delusions or hallucinations
- Phobias or obsessions
- Altered personality traits
- Magical ability fluctuations **Long-term Madness (`dice: 1d10` Ã— 10 years or permanent):**
- Fundamental personality changes
- Persistent altered reality perception
- Compulsive behaviors that dominate daily life
- Potential development of supernatural abilities ### Duration

Duration varies based on:
- Source and intensity of exposure
- Individual psychological resilience
- Speed and quality of treatment received
- Continued exposure to triggering phenomena ## Adventure Hooks 1. **The Spreading Madness**: Characters investigate a town where madness effects are spreading like a contagious disease

2. **Therapeutic Mission**: Party must safely escort a group of madness-affected individuals to treatment facilities
3. **The Mad Prophet**: A madness-afflicted NPC provides crucial information, but filtering truth from delusion proves challenging ## Secrets (DM Only) Certain forms of "madness" are actually the mind's attempt to process information from higher dimensions or alternative timelines. These individuals aren't truly insane but are perceiving realities that others cannot access. Some secret organizations actively seek out such individuals for their unique insights. ## Campaign Use Use madness effects as both mechanical challenges and roleplay opportunities. They can serve as consequences for reckless behavior, plot devices for mystery scenarios, or character development tools. Consider allowing players to choose how their characters express madness effects rather than imposing specific behaviors, maintaining agency while creating interesting complications. ## Player-Facing Summary Madness Effects is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Madness Effects as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Madness Effects. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
