# Pipe of Smoke Monsters
*Wondrous item, common*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/pipe-of-smoke-monsters.webp#right)


While smoking this pipe, you can take a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to exhale a puff of smoke that takes the form of a creature, such as a dragon, a flumph, or a slaad. The form must be small enough to fit in a 1-foot cube and loses its shape after a few seconds, becoming an ordinary puff of smoke.
