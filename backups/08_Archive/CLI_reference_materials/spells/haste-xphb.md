# Haste
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's [Speed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to [Armor Class](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/armor-class-xphb.md), it has [Advantage](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used to take only the [Attack](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Attack) (one attack only), [Dash](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Dash), [Disengage](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Disengage), [Hide](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Hide), or [Utilize](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Utilize) action.

When the spell ends, the target is [Incapacitated](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Incapacitated) and has a [Speed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) of 0 until the end of its next turn, as a wave of lethargy washes over it.

**Classes**: [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Ranger (Horizon Walker)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-horizon-walker-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Paladin (Oath of Vengeance)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-vengeance-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard (College of Lore)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Paladin (Oath of Glory)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-glory-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
