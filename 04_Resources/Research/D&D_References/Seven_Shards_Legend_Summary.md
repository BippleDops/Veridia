**Current Status:** Hidden in the Crushing Abyss
**Power:** Commands pressure, darkness, and the deep ocean

**Current Status:** Suspected in Aethermoor's Crown Vault
**Power:** Controls wind, light, and atmospheric forces
**Appearance:** Prism that captures and bends all light
**Guardian:** The Wind-Lords of Aethermoor
**Danger Level:** High - Can create reality-tearing storms #### 4. The Shard of Shadows

**Power:** Manipulates darkness, consciousness, and identity
**Appearance:** Void-black crystal that reflects no light
**Guardian:** Unknown
**Danger Level:** CRITICAL - Can separate souls from bodies #### 5. The Shard of Convergence

**Current Status:** Rumored to be at the Junction
**Power:** Merges realities, opens dimensional passages
**Appearance:** Multifaceted gem showing different worlds

*Reality's truth beneath star-filled skies.*
*But beware the price of power's call,*
*For one wrong step brings the fall of all."* ### Scholars' Interpretations **Optimistic View:** Reuniting the shards will restore the original Crown of Stars, bringing peace and prosperity to all realms. **Pessimistic View:** The shards were separated for good reason - bringing them together could destroy all reality. **Moderate View:** The shards can be safely reunited, but only by those pure of heart and wise in their use. ### Rewards for Information The Parliament of Echoes offers substantial rewards for verified information regarding shard locations or activities. Contact your local representative for details. **WARNING:** Attempting to personally interact with any shard without proper authorization and protection is extremely dangerous and potentially fatal. *Knowledge shared for the protection of all realms*
