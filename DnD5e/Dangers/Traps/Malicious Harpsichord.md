# Malicious Harpsichord
## Overview
*Magical trap*
This self-operating harpsichord plays hauntingly enchanting music. Any creature within 60 feet of the harpsichord who can hear it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the start of its turn. A creature who fails falls prone and must use its action to engage in a violent dance, throwing itself against the floor repeatedly, dealing 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage to itself. The creature cannot move from the space it occupies under its own power and is under this effect until it can no longer hear the harpsichord. On a successful save the creature is immune to the effects of the malicious harpsichord for 24 hours.

The harpsichord is made of a magically treated wood and much tougher than it looks. It has AC 21 and 100 hit points.
