## Special Traits
**Horn:** The source of a tentacled horrors power is its horn. If a tentacled horrors horn is removed or destroyed, the creature loses its regeneration ability, cant take legendary actions, and has disadvantage on attack rolls. The horn can be attacked specifically with targeted attacks but not area affects; it has AC 20, 30 hit points, and is immune to all damage types except slashing, bludgeoning, and force damage from spells or magic weapons. The horn can be torn off with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check made by a creature that is grappling the tentacled horror. Damage done to the horn does not reduce the tentacled horrors hit points.

**Regeneration:** A tentacled horror regains 10 hit points at the start of each of its turns. This ability doesnt function if it took cold or fire damage since its previous turn or if its horn is destroyed or removed. If the horn is damaged, regeneration heals it first.

**Insanity Toxin:** Creatures poisoned by insanity toxin must roll `dice: 1d10`, add their Intelligence modifier, and find the result on the table below. Affected creatures can repeat the saving throw if the tentacled horrors horn is torn off. A successful save ends the insanity. Otherwise, these effects are permanent until removed by magic that can end a curse.


| **Dice** | **Result** |
|---|---|
| 3- | Frightened—The creature flees from the tentacled horror and from any creature not of its own species. |
| 4 | Incapacitated—The creature wanders aimlessly, dropping its items, staring at whatever catches its fancy, giggling and weeping, incapable of speech or intelligent action. |
| 5 | Poisoned |
| 6 | Blinded |
| 7 | Stunned |
| 8 | Dominated—The creature falls completely under the tentacled horror’s control and does its best to kill any creatures that aren’t worshiping the tentacled horror. |
| 9 | Overcome by Self-Loathing—The creature draws a dagger or similar weapon and inflicts the weapon’s damage to itself automatically on each of its turns. If the creature has no suitable weapon or can’t use weapons, it bashes its head against a wall or floor instead, doing `dice: 1d4` + Str mod damage. Aside from performing this attack against itself, the creature is effectively stunned. |
| 10+ | Overcome by Worshipfulness—The creature wants nothing but to worship the tentacled horror. It prostrates itself and tosses one possession on each of its turns to the tentacled horror, beginning with the most valuable possession and working down. Aside from making these offerings, the creature is effectively stunned. |

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A tentacled horror attacks three times with tentacles.

**Tentacle:** *Melee Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (`dice: 2d6+6`) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled.

**Bite:** +10 to hit, one creature grappled by the tentacled horror. Hit: 12 (`dice: 1d12+6`) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effect of insanity toxin (see above).

**Escape:** The tentacled horror attempts to escape from a grapple.

**Tail Slap:** +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (`dice: 2d8+6`) bludgeoning damage.

## Description
Ancient and evil, a tentacled horror is a monstrosity from unknown depths of the earth. This monster is most often found inhabiting deep dungeons or ancient ruins far from the reaches of civilization.

Tentacled horrors are egotistical creatures that themselves above all others they encounter. A tentacled horror that finds its way into a subterranean society tries to set itself up as a god. Lesser creatures such as troglodytes, kuo-toas, and kobolds sometimes accept this false god and offer it living victims as sacrifices. Once ensconced as a ruler-deity, a tentacled horror is content to remain in one place and be served by its subjects. A tentacled horror that has been in power for a long time is surrounded by a pool of its own filth and the heaped bones of its victims.

A tentacled horror has a bloated but powerful, vaguely humanoid torso sitting atop a thick, sluglike foot. Sprouting from the torso are four tentacles lined with suction cups and tipped with cruel barbs. Most horrifying of all is its face. A tentacled horror has a lumpy, asymmetrical head dominated by a yawning chasm of a mouth, filled with spiky and broken teeth eager to sink into living flesh. Somewhere above it is a single, huge, unblinking eye that seems to drift languidly through the flesh of the head. Above the eye is a glistening, black 2-foot-long horn—the source of much of the tentacled horror’s power.

Although the origins of these horrors are unknown, their physical similarity to aboleths suggests that they may be mutant, idiotic relatives of that creature. Unlike the aboleth, the tentacled horror lacks both the intelligence and the ambition to dominate much more than it can see. Unfortunately, what it lacks in mental prowess, it makes up for with physical ferocity
