# Order of the Sunken Crown

*"In the depths where light fails, we carry the burden of lost majesty."*

## Overview
The Order of the Sunken Crown is a secretive organization dedicated to preserving the memory and recovering the artifacts of an ancient underwater kingdom that was destroyed in a cataclysmic event predating the founding of Aquabyssos. Members believe they are guardians of a rightful claim to underwater rulership and work to gather evidence of their kingdom's former glory.

## Historical Background
Founded by survivors and descendants of the lost kingdom, the Order has operated in secret for centuries, slowly gathering artifacts and knowledge while avoiding persecution by Aquabyssos authorities who view them as potential threats.

## Current State
The Order has gained new relevance as dimensional instabilities reveal previously hidden ruins and artifacts from their lost kingdom. Some members advocate for open declaration of their claims, while others prefer continued secrecy.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
- Bloodline or ideological connection to the lost kingdom
- Oath of secrecy and loyalty to the Order
- Dedication to recovering lost artifacts and knowledge
- Resistance to interrogation and mental intrusion

### Effects
- **Hidden Network**: Access to secret information and resources
- **Artifact Knowledge**: Expertise in ancient underwater relics
- **Political Opposition**: Conflict with current Aquabyssos government
- **Royal Legitimacy**: Claims to underwater rulership authority

### Duration

## Adventure Hooks

2. **Infiltration Mission**: Government seeks to expose Order activities
3. **Succession Crisis**: Order must choose new leadership during political upheaval

## Campaign Use
Provides political intrigue, ancient mysteries, and moral complexity around legitimate authority and lost heritage.
