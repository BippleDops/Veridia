# Anchor Storm

Anchors sing to one another. The ship steadies; the air tastes like copper and rain.

What you notice
- Hairs lifting on your arms
- A hum in your teeth

What you can try
- Keep the chant
- Watch for trouble in the calm

Possible outcomes
- The way grows still and sure
- The song wavers
- Something tries to break the harmony
