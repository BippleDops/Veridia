# Chromatic Orb
*1st-level, Evocation*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/chromatic-orb.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth 50+ GP)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You hurl an orb of energy at a target within range. Choose Acid, Cold, Fire, Lightning, Poison, or Thunder for the type of orb you create, and then make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `3d8` damage of the chosen type.

If you roll the same number on two or more of the d8s, the orb leaps to a different target of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Make an attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll. The orb can't leap again unless you cast the spell with a level 2+ spell slot.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d8` for each spell slot level above 1. The orb can leap a maximum number of times equal to the level of the slot expended, and a creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.
