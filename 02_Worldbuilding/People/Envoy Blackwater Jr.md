## Overview
Envoy Cassius Blackwater Jr. represents the third generation of the infamous Blackwater diplomatic dynasty. Born into privilege but marked by shadow from birth, Cassius walks the knife's edge between legitimate diplomacy and occult conspiracy. He serves as Aquabyssos's primary envoy to the Shadow Parliament while maintaining the facade of a respectable diplomatic heir. His charm and political acumen mask a deep corruption that threatens to consume both him and the realm he serves.

## Physical Description
Standing 6'1" with the lean, elegant build typical of diplomatic nobility, Cassius possesses an otherworldly handsomeness that draws attention in any room. His half-elven heritage is evident in his sharp features and pointed ears, but shadow corruption has left its mark—his naturally dark hair contains streaks that seem to absorb light, and his green eyes occasionally flash with an inner darkness.

He dresses immaculately in the latest diplomatic fashions, favoring deep blues and silver that complement Aquabyssos's formal protocols. His clothing always includes subtle shadow-touched elements: cufflinks that seem to drink light, a cloak pin that whispers in dead languages, and rings that grow cold when lies are spoken nearby.

A thin scar runs from his left temple to his jaw—a memento from his first diplomatic mission where he nearly died before making his pact with shadow entities. He covers it with carefully applied cosmetics during formal occasions.

## Personality
- **Public Persona**: Charming, sophisticated, eloquent, diplomatically brilliant
- **Hidden Nature**: Ambitious, ruthless, increasingly paranoid, haunted by shadow whispers
- **Values**: Family legacy, political power, knowledge at any cost, Aquabyssos supremacy
- **Fears**: Discovery of his shadow pacts, losing his sanity to the darkness, disappointing his father's legacy
- **Quirks**: Unconsciously traces the scar on his face when deep in thought, speaks to shadows when he thinks he's alone

## Background
Born into the prestigious Blackwater family, Cassius was groomed from childhood to continue the family's diplomatic tradition. The Blackwaters have served as Aquabyssos's premier diplomats for three generations, with each generation pushing the boundaries of acceptable political maneuvering further into morally gray territory.

Cassius's father, Admiral Thorne Blackwater, was a war hero who transitioned into diplomacy. His grandfather established the family's reputation through successful trade negotiations. Cassius, however, has taken the family legacy into truly dark territory.

During his first major diplomatic mission at age 22—negotiating with hostile deep-sea entities—Cassius found himself overwhelmed and facing certain death. In desperation, he made contact with shadow entities from beyond the normal realm, trading portions of his soul for the power to not just survive, but to excel beyond all expectations. This pact granted him supernatural diplomatic abilities but slowly corrupted his essential nature.

## Special Abilities

**Diplomatic Immunity.** Cassius has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, or magically compelled by creatures of equal or lower social standing. He also has resistance to psychic damage from political or social sources.

**Shadow Patron's Gift.** Once per long rest, Cassius can reroll any Charisma-based check and must use the new result. Additionally, he can cast *charm person* at will and *suggestion* three times per day without expending spell slots.

**Blackwater Legacy.** Cassius has advantage on History checks related to diplomatic precedents and political maneuvering. He automatically knows the general political stance of any government official he meets.

**Whispers of the Deep.** Cassius can understand and speak with any sentient creature for diplomatic purposes, as if under a permanent *tongues* effect. However, shadow entities sometimes whisper through his words without his conscious control.

**Warlock Spellcasting.** Cassius is a 10th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit). He regains all expended spell slots when he finishes a short or long rest. He knows the following warlock spells:

- **Cantrips (at will)**: *eldritch blast*, *minor illusion*, *prestidigitation*, *mage hand*
- **1st-5th level (2 5th-level slots)**: *armor of Agathys*, *hex*, *hold person*, *counterspell*, *dimension door*, *dominate person*, *scrying*, *modify memory*

## Actions

**Multiattack.** Cassius makes two Eldritch Blast attacks or casts a spell and makes one weapon attack.

**Diplomatic Blade.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. If the target is charmed by Cassius, they take an additional 7 (2d6) psychic damage.

**Eldritch Blast.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +9 to hit, range 120 ft., up to two targets. *Hit:* 12 (1d10 + 5) force damage. Targets are pushed 10 feet away from Cassius.

**Shadow Diplomacy (3/Day).** Cassius speaks with supernatural persuasion. All creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 hour. Charmed creatures view Cassius's requests as reasonable and are inclined to agree to diplomatic proposals.

**Invoke Shadow Patron (1/Day).** Cassius calls upon his shadow patron for aid. For the next minute, he gains the following benefits:
- Resistance to all damage types
- His spells ignore resistance to necrotic and psychic damage
- Creatures that start their turn within 10 feet of him must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom save or be frightened until the start of their next turn

## Equipment

- **Blackwater Signet Ring** (grants diplomatic privileges and contains emergency teleportation)

- **Diplomatic Immunity Papers** (magical documents granting legal protections)

## Current Activities

## Roleplaying Notes

### Personality in Action
**Voice**: Cultured and sophisticated, with perfect diction and diplomatic phrasing. Occasionally, shadow whispers slip into his speech, causing brief lapses in his composed demeanor.

**Mannerisms**:
- Unconsciously traces his scar when thinking deeply or stressed
- Always maintains perfect posture and formal bearing
- His shadow sometimes moves independently when he's agitated
- Touches his family signet ring when invoking family honor

### Speaking Patterns
- "In the interest of diplomatic relations, might I suggest..."
- "The Blackwater family has always stood for Aquabyssos's prosperity."
- "There are... alternative solutions... to every problem."
- "Some prices are worth paying for the greater good."

### Behavioral Tells
- **Stress Response**: His shadow whispers become more audible, and he starts speaking in ancient diplomatic formulae
- **Deception Mode**: Becomes overly formal and references family honor repeatedly
- **Shadow Influence**: His eyes briefly flash with darkness when the entities are speaking through him
- **Genuine Emotion**: Drops his diplomatic facade only when discussing his sister's safety

## Daily Routine
- **Dawn**: Private meditation and communication with shadow entities
- **Morning**: Review diplomatic correspondence and intelligence reports
- **Midday**: Official diplomatic meetings and ceremonial functions
- **Afternoon**: Private negotiations and shadow network coordination
- **Evening**: Social events for information gathering and relationship building
- **Night**: Study of occult texts and payment of shadow debts through minor soul offerings

## The Blackwater Legacy

The Blackwater family's diplomatic tradition spans three generations, with each building upon the last:

**Grandfather's Era**: Established family reputation through legitimate diplomatic skill and trade negotiations. Made the first shadow pact near the end of his life to secure a crucial treaty.

**Father's Era**: Expanded influence through military diplomacy and post-war negotiations. Deepened shadow connections to broker peace with hostile entities. Eventually consumed by shadow corruption.

**Cassius's Era**: Represents the culmination and possible destruction of the family legacy. His shadow debts are the deepest yet, but so is his diplomatic influence. Whether he saves or damns the family name depends on his choices in the coming crisis.

## The Shadow Debt System

Cassius's supernatural abilities come at the cost of his soul, measured as percentages:

- **20% Debt**: Gained supernatural charm and diplomatic immunity
- **40% Debt**: Acquired warlock spellcasting and shadow whispers
- **60% Debt (Current)**: Enhanced all abilities but shadow entities can sometimes override his decisions
- **80% Debt (Danger Zone)**: Would become permanent puppet of shadow entities
- **100% Debt**: Complete soul consumption and transformation into shadow entity
