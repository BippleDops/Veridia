## Special Traits
**Regeneration:** Teratashia regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she is in darkness. She regains 5 hit points if she is in dim light, and no hit points if she is in bright light.

**Light Avoidance:** Teratashia's speed increases to 50 feet and her flying speed increases to 70 feet if she is in bright light at the start of her turn. Her speed returns to normal when she starts her turn in dim light or darkness.

**Spell-like Abilities:** Teratashia can use the following spelllike abilities, using Charisma as her casting ability (DC 17, attack +9). She doesn’t need material components to use these abilities.

- At Will: *clairvoyance, darkness, detect thoughts, dimension door, dispel magic, fear, suggestion*

- 3/day: *charm person, insect plague, telekinesis, wall of stone*

**Teratashia's Necklace of Skulls:** Teratashia's necklace is a powerful magic item. It is made from 13 skulls, and each skull has gems set into the eye sockets. Each gem stores one magic spell; the wearer of the necklace can use an action (or reaction for counterspell) to cast one of the spells. Spells are cast at their lowest level, using the caster's attack bonus and saving throw DC. The necklace recovers one expended charge per hour when worn by Teratashia; it doesn't recover charges when worn by anyone else.

## Description
The Demon-Princess Teratashia’s dark palace in the depths of the Abyss is a nexus of countless gaps between dimensions, a warren of tunnels worming their way deep into a multitude of other realities. She is known in some circles as the Mistress of Dimensions. From the center of this network of connections, Teratashia sends her minions creeping and slithering through the planes of existence to do her bidding. Any type of demon can be found serving her, with or without the knowledge of any other masters it serves. Besides demons, mortal creatures that hunt and hide in the dark nonplaces between the true planes of existence can also be found in her service.

Teratashia resembles a huge, female-headed cockroach with a feral visage, wearing a necklace of human skulls. The necklace is a powerful magic item, but it functions at full effect only for Teratashia.

Teratashia seldom involves herself in the quarrels of the other great demons. She is far more interested in controlling the nooks and crannies between dimensions than with her political status in the Abyss. She is inclined to leave the other demon princes alone to the same degree that they extend that courtesy to her.
