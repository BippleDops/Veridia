# Elder Whisper-In-The-Dark
*The First Voice, She Who Speaks the Deep Truths, The Maddened Oracle*

## Overview
Elder Whisper-In-The-Dark is an ancient triton oracle who was among the first to hear [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]]'s whispers from the oceanic abyss. Once a respected prophet and spiritual guide, three centuries of exposure to the Deep Mother's influence has transformed her into something between divine oracle and maddened cultist. She speaks truths that shouldn't be known and prophecies that always come to pass, but her words come wrapped in riddles, shadow imagery, and half-mad ravings.

## Speaking Style
*"The depths whisper of futures painted in shadow and blood, little surface swimmer. Would you hear them?"*

*"I have seen your death, Admiral. It comes not from the depths you guard against, but from the poison in your own blood. The irony pleases the Dark Mother."*

*"Truth is a weight that crushes the unprepared. Lies are bubbles that rise to the surface. Which do you choose to breathe?"*

*"The Seven Songs will reunite, but not as the ancients intended. Marina dances to music she cannot hear. The Sage weaves fate with threads of starlight and sorrow."*

*(During prophecy trance)* "She rises... she rises... the Deep Mother stirs and the waters will boil with her awakening. The crown that was shattered becomes the chain that binds the depths to the surface... blood in the water... blood in the water..."*
