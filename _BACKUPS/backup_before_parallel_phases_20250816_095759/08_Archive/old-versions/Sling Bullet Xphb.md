*Ammunition* - **Weight**: 0.075 lbs. Sling bullets are used with a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. Sling Bullets are typically stored in a [[component-pouch-xphb (items) (bought separately). *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 222.
