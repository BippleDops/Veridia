*The Growing Heart of Aquabyssos Technology* > *"People think crystals are just rocks that happen to be magical. They don't understand that crystals are living systems, communities that must be tended, nurtured, and understood. In the Crystal Forest, we don't just harvest technology—we cultivate civilization itself."*
