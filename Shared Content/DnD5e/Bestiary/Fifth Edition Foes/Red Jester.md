## Special Traits
**Fear Cackle (1/Day):** As an action, a red jester can unleash a fear-inducing cackle. All creatures within 60 feet that hear the cackle must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for `dice: 2d4` rounds. A frightened creature has a 50% chance of immediately dropping everything it holds in its hands.

**Unassailable Mind:** The mind of a red jester is a twisted and dangerous place to peer into. If a living creature targets a red jester with an attack that normally causes psychic damage, or tries to use telepathy on a red jester, that creature must make a successful DC 13 Intelligence saving throw or be cursed, with an effect identical to a permanent confusion spell. The confusion effect can be ended only by magic that lifts the curse.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A red jester attacks twice with fists, or once with its jesters deck, or twice with its mace.

**Fist:** *Melee Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (`dice: 1d12+3`) bludgeoning damage.

**Jester's Deck:*** Ranged Attack*: +6 to hit, range 20 ft., one creature. Hit: the target creature is affected as if he or she drew a random card from the Deck of Many Things. In the hands of anyone but a red jester, the jesters deck acts as a normal, nonmagical deck of playing cards.

**+2 Mace of Merriment: Melee Attack:** +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (`dice: 2d8+4`) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed with Merriment for `dice: 1d3` rounds. In the hands of anyone but a red jester, the weapon acts as a +1 mace.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
Red jesters are thought to be the undead form of court jesters who were executed for telling bad jokes, for making fun of their lord and master, or who died in some other violent, untimely manner. Legend speaks of the red jesters as being the court jesters of Orcus, [[Thalasskoptis, Demon Prince|Demon Prince]] of the Undead, sent to the Material Plane to “entertain” those the demon prince singled out for special attention. The real truth behind their origin remains a mystery.

While they can be encountered from the coldest to the warmest regions of the world and on any type of terrain, a red jester is generally encountered near civilization. They are the only undead that show any sign of retaining a sense of humor that living persons might relate to (as opposed to the sorts of things some undead appear to find amusing, such as sadism, horror, and death). Red jesters seem to actually enjoy entertaining the living, at least briefly. They can turn murderous at the drop of a hat, however, if their act doesn’t get exactly the reaction the red jester expected or hoped for.

Most red jesters don masks or wear heavy makeup to disguise their deathly features. They engage in humorous patter during their acts, lapsing between languages apparently without regard for the audience—and failing to get a laugh is sure to send a red jester into a rampage, even if it’s his own fault for telling the joke in a language no one in the audience understands. This patter of jokes, riddles, and bad puns keeps up even while the red jester is murdering everyone within reach.

The trouble usually begins when the strange entertainer does something inexplicable that fails to get a laugh, then grits his teeth and says, “Maybe you’d prefer to see . . . a card trick?”
