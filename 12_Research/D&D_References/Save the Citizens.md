## Overview
Save the Citizens represents emergency rescue operations where characters must protect and evacuate civilian populations during various catastrophes affecting both Aethermoor and Aquabyssos. These missions require coordination, resource management, and difficult decisions about who can be saved when time and resources are limited.

## Historical Background
Citizen rescue protocols developed after major disasters highlighted the need for organized emergency response. Early rescue attempts were often chaotic and resulted in unnecessary casualties.

## Current State
Modern rescue operations use improved coordination systems and magical enhancements, though they remain challenging when dealing with inter-realm disasters or supernatural threats.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Natural Disaster**: Earthquake or flood requires mass evacuation
2. **Monster Attack**: Citizens trapped during creature assault
3. **Magical Catastrophe**: Dimensional instability threatens populated areas

## Campaign Use
Provides moral weight to adventures and opportunities for heroic actions with lasting consequences.

## Player-Facing Summary

Save the Citizens is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Save the Citizens as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Save the Citizens.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
