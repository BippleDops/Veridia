--- # Master Narrative Web ## Overview

## Description

Detailed description pending.

High-level plot threads and how they interconnect across Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. Use this to visualize options, not to constrain play. ## Primary Threads

- Seven Shards Convergence
- Crystal Plague Contagion
- Faction War Over Sovereignty
- Memory Tide and Pressure Depth Hazards ## Decision Trees (Major Branches)```mermaid

- If players ally with Syndicate early, increase black market availability but raise lawful scrutiny clocks by 2 ticks across port locations.
- If a shard is activated without guardian consent, spawn Convergence anomalies in nearby locations for three sessions.
- If a cure is rushed, it works but creates a resistant strain; later plague checks increase DC by 2 until Verdant Accord research completes. ## Timeline Dependencies

- Festival of Rising Tides must occur before The Second Rising; delaying triggers refugee waves, altering market supply.
- The Sunken Library revelations unlock shard resonance options; attempting before that imposes additional ritual components.
- War Council outcomes set mass-combat stakes for the Faction War finale. ## Cross-Index Links
