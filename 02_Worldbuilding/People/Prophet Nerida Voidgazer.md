## Overview
Prophet Nerida Voidgazer leads the [[Church of the Tidal Throne]] from [[The Sunken Cathedral of Stars]], preaching that [[The Great Drowning]] was divine judgment and that worse is coming. Her eyes are pools of black water that reflect no light, supposedly allowing her to see across all depths simultaneously. She speaks in multiple voices - sometimes her own, sometimes echoing things from [[The Whispering Depths]], sometimes in tongues that predate human language.

## History
Was a young priestess when the drowning began. Tried to hold back the waters with prayer and was swept into [[The Cerulean Trench]]. Emerged three days later, changed. Has led the Church for 127 years, not aging but slowly becoming less human. Claims to have spoken with the gods beneath the waters.
