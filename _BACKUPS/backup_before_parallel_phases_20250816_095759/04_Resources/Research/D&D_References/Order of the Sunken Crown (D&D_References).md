The Order of the Sunken Crown is a secretive organization dedicated to preserving the memory and recovering the artifacts of an ancient underwater kingdom that was destroyed in a cataclysmic event predating the founding of Aquabyssos. Members believe they are guardians of a rightful claim to underwater rulership and work to gather evidence of their kingdom's former glory. ## Historical Background

Founded by survivors and descendants of the lost kingdom, the Order has operated in secret for centuries, slowly gathering artifacts and knowledge while avoiding persecution by Aquabyssos authorities who view them as potential threats. ## Current State

1. **Crown Fragment**: Discovery of artifact that proves Order's claims
2. **Infiltration Mission**: Government seeks to expose Order activities
3. **Succession Crisis**: Order must choose new leadership during political upheaval ## Campaign Use

Provides political intrigue, ancient mysteries, and moral complexity around legitimate authority and lost heritage. ## Player-Facing Summary Order of the Sunken Crown is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Order of the Sunken Crown as a nexus where past and present converge.
