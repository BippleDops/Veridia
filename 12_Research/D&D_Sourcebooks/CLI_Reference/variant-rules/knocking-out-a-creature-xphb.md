## Lore Details

Legends speak of knocking out a creature xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around knocking out a creature xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties knocking out a creature xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
