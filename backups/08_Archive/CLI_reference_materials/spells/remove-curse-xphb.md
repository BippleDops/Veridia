# Remove Curse
*3rd-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If the object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell breaks its owner's [Attunement](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/attunement-xphb.md) to the object so it can be removed or discarded.
