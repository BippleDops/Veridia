--- # Defender

*Legendary (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/defender.webp#right) You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The first time you attack with the weapon on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the weapon's bonus to your [[armor-class-xphb (variant-rules). For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack rolls and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to [armor-class-xphb (variant-rules)]]. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the weapon to gain a bonus to AC from it. **Variants**:

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of defender xdmg as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around defender xdmg. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A shipment has gone missing and evil awakens
