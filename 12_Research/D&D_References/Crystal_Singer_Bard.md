# Crystal Singer Bard - Character Build

## Overview
The Crystal Singer represents a unique bardic tradition that harnesses the resonant frequencies of magical crystals to create powerful effects. These performers bridge the gap between [[Aquabyssos]] and [[Aethermoor]], using crystalline harmonics to manipulate reality, heal the corrupted, and communicate across dimensional boundaries. They are as much scientists as artists, studying the fundamental frequencies that bind the dual worlds together.

## Core Concept
Crystal Singers are bards who have learned to attune their voices and instruments to the natural resonance of magical crystals. They can purify corrupted crystals, enhance magical effects, and even stabilize reality tears through harmonic intervention. Many serve as diplomats between the two worlds, as their abilities work equally well in water and air environments.

## Starting Statistics
