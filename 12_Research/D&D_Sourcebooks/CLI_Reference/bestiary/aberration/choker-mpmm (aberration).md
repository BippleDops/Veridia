# [[choker mpmm|Choker]]

The choker is a subterranean predator far more dangerous than its small size and spindly, rubbery limbs would suggest.

Chokers have cartilage rather than a bony skeleton. This flexible internal structure enables them to easily slip into narrow fissures and niches in the walls of their cavern homes. They lurk in these spots, silent and unseen, waiting for prey to happen by.

A choker's usual method for luring prey involves positioning the body of its latest catch just outside its hiding spot. Whenever it gets hungry, it tears off a few chunks of flesh to feed itself. In the meantime, the corpse serves to entice other curious folkâ€”explorers from the surface world, drow, duergar, or the choker's favorite prey, goblinsâ€”to come within reach.

When a target presents itself, the choker's starfish-shaped hands dart out of its hiding spot, wrap around the victim's throat, and pin the unfortunate creature against the cavern wall. Because its arms are so long, the choker can keep its body deep inside the crevice where it hides, beyond the reach of most normal weapons.

Chokers tend to set their ambushes alone, rather than working in concert, but where one choker is found, others are likely to be nearby. They communicate through eerie, keening howls that travel long distances through caves and tunnels but are difficult to identify or locate in a typical echo-filled cavern.
