![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/vicious-mockery.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at one creature you can see or hear within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take `d6` Psychic damage and have [Disadvantage](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by `d6` when you reach levels 5 (`2d6`), 11 (`3d6`), and 17 (`4d6`).

**Classes**: [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
