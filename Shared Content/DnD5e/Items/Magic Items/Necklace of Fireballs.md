## Description
This necklace has `dice: 1d6+3` (1d6+3) beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level **[[Fireball|fireball]]** spell (save [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15).

You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the **[[Fireball|fireball]]** by 1 for each bead beyond the first.
