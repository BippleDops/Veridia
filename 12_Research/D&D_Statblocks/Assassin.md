**Evasion.** When subjected to an effect that allows a Dex saving throw for half damage, Vespara takes no damage on success and half on failure.

## Description

Vespara Thorne is a legendary assassin who walks the razor's edge between Aethermoor and Aquabyssos. Once a noble's daughter from the Crystal Spires, she was touched by shadow corruption during a diplomatic mission to the depths. Rather than succumb to madness, she embraced the darkness and became something new—a killer who moves between worlds like a whisper in the night.

Standing 5'6" with platinum hair streaked with shadow-black, Vespara's most striking feature is her heterochromic eyes: one crystal-blue (Aethermoor heritage), one void-black (shadow corruption). Intricate tattoos of crystalline patterns spiral down her arms, pulsing faintly with trapped shadows.

She operates from the Shadowblade District, a neutral zone where information flows like water and contracts are sealed in blood and crystal dust. Her reputation is built on three pillars: she never misses a target, she never breaks a contract, and she never kills without cause.

## Equipment

- **Shadow Blade** (enchanted rapier that phases between material and shadow)
- **Crystal Shards** (20 throwing darts made from corrupted Aethermoor crystals)
- **Studded Leather Armor +2** (reinforced with shadow-silk)
- **Cloak of Elvenkind**
- **Thieves' Tools** (masterwork)
- **Potion of Greater Healing** (2)

## Relationships

**Allies:**
- **[[The Biomancers]]** - Has an uneasy alliance; they occasionally hire her services and she provides them with rare shadow-touched specimens
- **Master Keth** - Her former mentor in the Shadowblade Guild (presumed dead)
- **Whisper Network** - Information brokers throughout both realms

**Enemies:**
- **[[Parliament Loyalists]]** - They've placed a massive bounty on her head for assassinating Lord Crystalborn
- **The Purification Order** - Zealots who see her shadow corruption as an abomination
- **House Thorne** - Her own family disowned her after her transformation

**Complicated:**
- **Captain Aldric Shadowmend** - Former lover turned political rival
- **The Shadow Courts** - She owes them a debt that grows heavier each day

## Quest Hooks

1. **The Crystal Heart Contract** - Vespara has been hired to steal the Heart of Aethermoor, but the job feels wrong. She needs the party's help to uncover who's really behind the contract.

2. **Shadow Debt** - The Shadow Courts are calling in Vespara's debt. She must complete three impossible tasks or forfeit her soul. She reluctantly seeks allies.

3. **Family Reunion** - House Thorne is hosting a grand ball, and Vespara has received an invitation written in her mother's hand. It's obviously a trap, but she can't resist going.

4. **The Biomancer's Gambit** - [[The Biomancers]] have offered Vespara a cure for her shadow corruption, but the price is assassinating someone she's sworn to protect.

5. **Mentor's Legacy** - Master Keth has been spotted alive in the deepest trenches of Aquabyssos, but he's no longer entirely human. Vespara needs a team to help her reach him.

## Secrets

- **The True Contract**: Vespara's shadow corruption wasn't accidental—she chose it to gain the power needed to kill the person who murdered her younger brother.
- **Royal Blood**: She's actually third in line for the Aethermoor throne, a fact she's kept hidden since her exile.
- **The Shadow Pact**: Her power comes from a deal with an entity from beyond both realms, and the debt is nearly due.
- **Double Agent**: She secretly feeds information to a resistance group trying to prevent war between the realms.
- **The Last Mission**: Her final target before retirement is someone in the party's inner circle—but she's beginning to question if they really deserve to die.

## Roleplaying Notes

**Personality**: Cool, calculated, but surprisingly moral. Speaks in measured tones with occasional flashes of dry humor.

**Ideals**: "Death should have meaning. I am the sword that cuts away corruption, even if I must be corrupted to wield it."

**Bonds**: "My brother's death will be avenged, no matter the cost to my soul."

**Flaws**: "I trust no one completely, not even those who've earned it. Everyone has a price, everyone has a secret, everyone will betray you eventually."

**Voice**: Speaks Common with an upper-class accent that she occasionally slips back into. Uses Aquabyssan curse words when frustrated.

## Player-Facing Summary

Assassin is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Assassin as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Assassin.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Assassin to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at Assassin to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to Assassin active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
