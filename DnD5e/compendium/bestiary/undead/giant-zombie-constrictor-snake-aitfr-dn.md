## Description

These enormous, rotten husks were living, Medium-sized constrictors when the yuan-ti brought them to honor and entice Kyrilla to share her knowledge and powers. They grew to their full, Huge size on a diet of supplicants and prisoners, many of whose bones can be found elsewhere in the lair. When the yuan-ti turned against Kyrilla, they fought and slew these snakesâ€”only to find them slithering again through cursed, ambient magic in Kyrilla's lair.

The constrictors die if they leave the lair.
