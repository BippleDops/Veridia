These Barbarians learn magical means to communicate with animals, and their Rage heightens their connection to animals as it fills them with supernatural might. ### Animal Speaker (Level 3) You can cast the [[beast and [Speak With Animals Xphb]] spells but only as Rituals. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. ### Rage of the Wilds (Level 3) Your Rage taps into the primal power of animals. Whenever you activate your Rage, you gain one of the following options of your choice. #### Bear While your Rage is active, you have [[boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats) to every damage type except Force, Necrotic, Psychic, and Radiant. #### Eagle When you activate your Rage, you can take the [actions#Disengage|Disengage]] and [[actions#Dash|Dash actions as part of that [Action Xphb]]. While your Rage is active, you can take a [[Action Xphb to take both of those actions. #### Wolf While your Rage is active, your allies have [Advantage Xphb]] on attack rolls against any enemy of yours within 5 feet of you. ### Aspect of the Wilds (Level 6) You gain one of the following options of your choice. Whenever you finish a [[long-rest-xphb, you can change your choice. #### Owl You have [senses#Darkvision|Darkvision]] with a range of 60 feet. If you already have [[senses#Darkvision|Darkvision, its range increases by 60 feet. #### Panther You have a [Climb Speed Xphb]] equal to your [[Fly Speed Xphb. #### Salmon You have a [swim-speed-xphb (variant-rules)]] equal to your [[Fly Speed Xphb. ### Nature Speaker (Level 10) You can cast the [Commune With Nature Xphb]] spell but only as a [[Ritual Xphb. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for it. ### Power of the Wilds (Level 14) Whenever you activate your Rage, you gain one of the following options of your choice. #### Falcon While your Rage is active, you have a [Fly Speed Xphb]] equal to your [[Fly Speed Xphb if you aren't wearing any armor. #### Lion While your Rage is active, any of your enemies within 5 feet of you have [Advantage Xphb]] on attack rolls against targets other than you or another Barbarian who has this option active. #### Ram While your Rage is active, you can cause a Large or smaller creature to have the [[conditions#prone|Prone condition when you hit it with a melee attack. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Barbarian xphb path of the wild heart xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
