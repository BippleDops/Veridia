- **Skill Proficiencies.** [[skills#Athletics|Athletics]], [[skills#Perception|Perception]]  
- **Tool Proficiencies.** [[navigators-tools-xphb|Navigator's tools]], vehicles (water)  
- **Equipment.** A belaying pin ([[club-xphb|club]]), [[silk-rope-50-feet|silk rope (50 feet)]], a lucky charm such as a rabbit foot or a small stone with a hole in the center (or you may roll for a random [[trinket-xphb|trinket]] on the Trinkets table in chapter 5), a set of [[common-clothes|common clothes]], and a belt [[pouch-xphb|pouch]] containing 10 gp  

You spent your youth under the sway of a dread pirate, a ruthless cutthroat who taught you how to survive in a world of sharks and savages. You've indulged in larceny on the high seas and sent more than one deserving soul to a briny grave. Fear and bloodshed are no strangers to you, and you've garnered a somewhat unsavory reputation in many a port town.

If you decide that your sailing career involved piracy, you can choose the Bad Reputation feature instead of the Ship's Passage feature.

## Feature: Bad Reputation

No matter where you go, people are afraid of you due to your reputation. When you are in a civilized settlement, you can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report your activity to the authorities.

## Suggested Characteristics

Sailors can be a rough lot, but the responsibilities of life on a ship make them generally reliable as well. Life aboard a ship shapes their outlook and forms their most important attachments.
