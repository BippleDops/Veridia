# Calm Emotions
*2nd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each Humanoid in a 20-foot-radius [[sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]] centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects (choose for each creature):

- The creature has [[immunity xphb|Immunity]] to the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] and [[conditions#frightened|Frightened]] conditions until the spell ends. If the creature was already [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] or [[conditions#frightened|Frightened]], those conditions are suppressed for the duration.  
- The creature becomes [[indifferent-attitude-xphb|Indifferent]] about creatures of your choice that it's [[hostile-attitude-xphb|Hostile]] toward. This indifference ends if the target takes damage or witnesses its allies taking damage. When the spell ends, the creature's attitude returns to normal.
