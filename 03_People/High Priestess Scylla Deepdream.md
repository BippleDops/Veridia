## Overview
Once a surface world oracle who foresaw the Great Drowning, Scylla chose to drown herself ritually to gain the power to shape it.

She speaks only in prophecies and views linear time as a quaint limitation.

## DM Notes
Scylla represents the alien horror of Aquabyssosâ€”someone who chose transformation and can't understand why others resist. Her temporal abilities make her nearly impossible to surprise or defeat conventionally. She should feel like a force of nature rather than a person, speaking in paradoxes and prophecies that come true in unexpected ways. Her genuine belief that she's saving the world through drowning makes her sympathetic yet terrifying.
