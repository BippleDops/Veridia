# Goodberry
*1st-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sprig of mistletoe)
- **Duration:** 24 hours

Ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Point]], and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.

Uneaten berries disappear when the spell ends.
