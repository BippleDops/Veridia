## Overview

The Deep Mother is the primordial entity believed to slumber in the deepest trenches beneath [[Aquabyssos]]. According to ancient [[Aboleth Prime Yoth]] memories and the teachings of [[The Drowned Prophets]], she is the source of all water, darkness, and dreams in the world. Her endless slumber generates the reality of Aquabyssos itselfâ€”the underwater realm exists within her dreaming consciousness.

### The First Dream

Before time, before light, there was only the Deep Mother floating in the primordial void. Her first dream created water, her second created darkness, and her third created the potential for life. As she descended into deeper slumber, her dreams became more complex, birthing:

1. **The Depths**: Physical layers of reality corresponding to sleep stages
2. **The Aboleths**: First children, born from her memories
3. **Shadows**: Fragments of her unconscious mind
4. **Pressure**: Her embrace holding reality together
5. **The [[Hadal Depths|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Hadal Depths]]**: Where her physical form rests

### The Great Awakening (Prophecy)

Multiple conflicting prophecies describe what will happen if the Deep Mother awakens:
- **[[The Drowned Prophets]]**: She will remake reality as paradise
- **[[Aboleth Prime Yoth]]**: All will merge into singular consciousness
- **[[The Scattered Emperor]]**: The world will dissolve back into void
- **[[Prophet Nerida Voidgazer]]**: She already awakens through the shadows

### The Sleeping Form

Deep beneath the [[Hadal Depths|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Hadal Depths]], explorers claim to have seen:
- Mountain ranges that are actually her coiled body
- Abyssal trenches that are spaces between her tentacles
- Volcanic vents that are her slow breaths
- Bioluminescent zones marking her dreams
- The [[Depth Pulse]]: Her heartbeat felt throughout Aquabyssos

### Dream Emanations

Her dreams manifest physically as:
- **Shadow Creatures**: Nightmares given form
- **Memory Currents**: Streams of collective unconscious
- **Pressure Zones**: Emotional weight made physical
- **Temporal Distortions**: Dreams where time flows differently
- **The [[Shadow Convergence]]**: Her approaching awakening

### The Drowned Prophets

Primary cult worshipping the Deep Mother:
- Ritual drowning to experience her embrace
- Memory sacrifices to feed her dreams
- Shadow meditation to commune with her
- Pressure baptisms at increasing depths
- Dream journals documenting her messages

### Orthodox Worship

Mainstream acknowledgment includes:
- **Depth Day**: Annual descent ceremonies
- **Dream Tides**: Monthly shadow observations
- **Sorrow Pearls**: Offerings at underwater shrines
- **The Drowning Hour**: Daily meditation at deepest night
- **Pressure Psalms**: Hymns sung while descending

### Shadow Connection

The shadow corruption spreading through Aquabyssos is believed to be:
- Her nightmares becoming stronger
- Preparation for her awakening
- Her immune system fighting invasion
- Dreams bleeding into reality
- Fragments of her consciousness achieving independence

### Primary Locations

1. **[[12_Research/D&D_Statblocks/The Deepmind]]**: Where her thoughts pool
2. **[[The Dreaming Trench]]**: Deepest known point
3. **[[Shadow Wells]]**: Where her nightmares emerge
4. **[[Memory Meadows]]**: Her pleasant dreams manifest
5. **[[Pressure Palace]]**: Built atop her resting place

### Central Questions

1. **Is she conscious or truly sleeping?**
2. **Are inhabitants separate or part of her dream?**
3. **Will awakening destroy or transform reality?**
4. **Do prayers reach her or just her dreams?**
5. **Is the shadow corruption her will or sickness?**

### Passive Effects

All of Aquabyssos experiences:
- **Dream Bleed**: Sleeping minds touch hers
- **Pressure Presence**: Her weight on reality
- **Shadow Independence**: Her unconscious manifesting
- **Memory Currents**: Collective experiences flowing
- **Depth Calling**: Urge to descend toward her

### Signs of Stirring

Recent events suggesting she stirs:
1. Increased shadow independence
2. Pressure zones shifting unexpectedly
3. Mass shared dreams across Aquabyssos
4. Aboleths experiencing new memories
5. Time distortions increasing

### The Seven Seals of Slumber

Ancient prophecy of her awakening:
1. **First Seal**: Shadows gain independence *(broken)*
2. **Second Seal**: The Scattered Emperor unifies *(in progress)*
3. **Third Seal**: Surface and Depths unite
4. **Fourth Seal**: The Memory Harvest completes
5. **Fifth Seal**: The Crystal Crown reforms
6. **Sixth Seal**: The Final Sorrow is wept
7. **Seventh Seal**: A mortal speaks her true name

### Blessings of the Deep Mother

Devoted followers may receive:
- **Pressure Adaptation**: Immunity to depth effects
- **Dream Sight**: See through illusions and lies
- **Shadow Affinity**: Befriend shadow creatures
- **Memory Shield**: Protection from psychic intrusion
- **Depth Speaker**: Communicate with sea life

### Curses of the Deep Mother

Those who offend her suffer:
- **Pressure Nightmares**: Exhaustion from dreams
- **Shadow Rejection**: Own shadow becomes enemy
- **Memory Holes**: Forget important things
- **Depth Sickness**: Disadvantage at any depth
- **The Drowning Dream**: Feeling of drowning on dry land

### The Truth About the Deep Mother

> [!warning] Ultimate Campaign Secret
> The Deep Mother is actually:
> - The original ocean deity who chose to sleep rather than fight in the god wars
> - Dreaming Aquabyssos as an escape from divine politics
> - Connected to [[12_Research/D&D_Statblocks/The Crimson Sage]] (Aetheron) - they were lovers
> - The shadow corruption is her beginning to wake due to Aetheron's proximity
> - Her awakening would merge Aquabyssos and Aethermoor into something new

- [[The Dream Compass]] - Points to her thoughts
- [[Shadow Womb Shard]] - Fragment of her essence
- [[The First Pearl]] - Created from her first tear
