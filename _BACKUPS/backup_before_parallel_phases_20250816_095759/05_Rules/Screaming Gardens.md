## Where Every Tree Was Once a Drowning Child

> *"They planted screams and grew a forest. Now the forest sings warnings no one heeds."*
> — The Conductor

## Overview

The Screaming Gardens sprawl across three square miles of Abyssos Prime's eastern district, a crystallized forest where every tree was formed from the death screams of drowning victims. When the current flows through the crystal branches, they resonate with the final moments of those who died, creating an endless symphony of warning and anguish.

### The [Great Drowning]]

During the Cataclysm of Tides, thousands of children were at the Meridian Youth Academy when the waters rose. Their screams crystallized in the magical catastrophe, growing into the first trees. Over centuries, more screaming trees have been "planted" as executions, murders, and suicides add to the grove.

### The Conductor's Arrival

Fifty years ago, a musician named Orpheus Deepnote went mad trying to compose a symphony from the screams. He transformed himself into living sound, becoming [[The Conductor, and now orchestrates the gardens' cacophony into prophetic warnings.

#### The Songwood Grove

**Description**: The oldest section, where the original academy children became trees
**Tree Types**: Primarily blue-crystal from drowning
**Sounds**: Children calling for parents, school songs turned to dirges
**Danger**: Memory parasites feed on visitors' childhood trauma

#### The Execution Clearing

**Description**: Where the Parliament conducts public crystallization executions
**Tree Types**: Purple-crystal from magical execution
**Sounds**: Last words, curses, declarations of innocence
**Danger**: Trees actively try to grab and crystallize visitors

#### The Suicide Spiral

**Description**: A spiral [path]] where the desperate come to join the garden
**Tree Types**: Grey-crystal from voluntary transformation
**Sounds**: Whispers of despair, promises of peace
**Danger**: Compulsion effects, WIS save **DC 16** or walk toward center

#### The Prophet's Podium

**Description**: Central platform where The Conductor performs
**Tree Types**: Mixed, arranged by tonal quality
**Sounds**: Organized into actual prophecies and warnings
**Danger**: The Conductor's experiments with visitors' screams

### The Mother Tree

The largest tree, formed from a pregt woman who [[Drowned trying to save her children. Some[Time]]s, on quiet nights, you can hear a lullaby that causes uncontrollable weeping.

### The Harmony Hollow

A depression where screams cancel each other out, creating perfect silence. The only quiet place in the gardens, but [[The Silence is so complete it causes madness.

### The Echo Chamber

A crystalline amphitheater where screams bounce eternally, growing louder with each reflection. Entering means hearing every scream that ever was and ever will be.

### The Missing Verse

The Conductor claims the gardens' symphony is missing one crucial scream - a specific person who needs to die to complete the prophecy. They're willing to pay anything to arrange this death.

### The Silent Child

A living child wanders the gardens, completely mute, unaffected by the screams. The trees seem to bow away from them. No one knows who they are or why they're there.

### The Backwards Tree

One tree screams in reverse, speaking of events that haven't happened yet. Its prophecies are always accurate but understanding them requires surviving prolonged exposure.

### The Garden's Growth

The gardens are expanding faster than new deaths can account for. Trees are appearing that contain screams from [People]] who are still alive, suggesting [[Timeline contamination.
