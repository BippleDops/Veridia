# Revivify
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth 300+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature revives with 1 [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Point]]. This spell can't revive a creature that has died of old age, nor does it restore any missing body parts.
