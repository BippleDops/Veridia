# Counterspell
*3rd-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Reaction
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. The creature makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]], or [[reaction xphb|Reaction]] used to cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot, the slot isn't expended.
