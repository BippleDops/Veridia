--- > [!figure] Portrait ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Shadow Replacement > *"Welcome to the depths where light drowns! Forgive me, that's not funny where you're from."* ### Physical Appearance

Senator Glaucus appears as a tall, unnaturally thin figure whose translucent skin reveals dark veins pulsing beneath. His eyes are completely blackâ€”no whites, no iris, just pools of darkness that seem to absorb light. When he moves, his shadow doesn't quite match his actions, often gesturing independently or remaining still when he walks. ### Before Replacement

The original Glaucus was a respected senator, advocate for surface-depth trade relations, and opponent of isolation policies. He investigated shadow anomalies three weeks ago and disappeared for two days. ### The Replacement

Three weeks ago, Glaucus was ambushed at the [[Reflection Pools]] and underwent forced shadow separation. His shadow gained independence and replaced him, while the original was imprisoned in the [[The Memory Meadows|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Memory Meadows]]. The shadow retained all of Glaucus's memories but none of his morality. ### Immediate Goals

1. Pass the Shadow Citizenship Act (tomorrow's vote)
2. Identify party as threat or asset
3. Prevent discovery of imprisoned original
4. Facilitate Shadow Duchess's arrival ### Critical Information


1. **The Switch:** Happened at night exactly 21 days ago
2. **The Original:** Imprisoned in Memory Meadow kelp, slowly being forgotten
3. **The Tell:** His shadow moves 0.5 seconds before he does
4. **The Fear:** Terrified of true sunlight (would destroy him)
5. **The Weakness:** Saying original's true name three times causes pain ### Tells That He's a Shadow


1. Shadow moves independently
2. Never blinks
3. Avoids bright lights
4. Laughs at tragedy
5. Cold to the touch
6. No breath misting in cold
7. Doesn't cast shadow in shadow --- *"In the Parliament of Echoes, even the senators are just shadows of democracy."* ## Player-Facing Summary Senator Glaucus is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Senator Glaucus as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Senator Glaucus. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A merchant needs help stealing before dawn


- Someone is blackmailing a artifact for revenge
- A map reveals a conspiracy about the government
- A map reveals the truth about the cult ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
