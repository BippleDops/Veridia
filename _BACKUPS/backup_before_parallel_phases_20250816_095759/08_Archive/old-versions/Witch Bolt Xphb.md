--- # Witch Bolt

*1st-level, Evocation* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/witch-bolt.webp#right) - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a twig struck by lightning)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute A beam of crackling energy lances toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against it. On a hit, the target takes``dice: 2d12``Lightning damage. On each of your subsequent turns, you can take a [[Action Xphb to deal`d12`Lightning damage to the target automatically, even if the first attack missed. The spell ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has Total [Cover Xphb]] from you. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The initial damage increases by`d12`for each spell slot level above 1. **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 343* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Witch bolt xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of witch bolt xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around witch bolt xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
