# Synaptic Static
*5th-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause psychic energy to erupt at a point within range. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]] centered on that point makes an Intelligence saving throw, taking `8d6` Psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

On a failed save, a target also has muddled thoughts for 1 minute. During that time, it subtracts `d6` from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as any Constitution saving throws to maintain [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Concentration|Concentration]]. The target makes an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
