## Clues & Information
### Known

- Should have arrived 3 days ago
- Carried 10 crates of star-iron ore
- Guarded by 4 mercenaries

### Hidden
- Bandits were tipped off by someone in town
- The ore is being sold to a rival faction
- This is part of a larger plot to weaken the town guard

## Potential Complications
1. Weather turns bad, making tracking difficult
2. Rival adventuring party also seeking the reward
3. Bandits have moved the ore to multiple locations

## Phase 1: The Investigation (Session 1)

### Opening Hook
Gareth Ironforge approaches the party in his smithy, visibly worried. Tools lie scattered on his workbench, and several half-finished weapons await completion. The smell of cold forge-fire fills the air as he explains his predicament.

*"I've been the town's primary weaponsmith for twenty years, and I've never missed a deadline. But without that star-iron ore, the guard's weapons will remain unfinished, leaving our defenses compromised. I fear something terrible has happened to Dolrim and his men."*

### Initial Investigation Opportunities
#### At the Smithy (Investigation DC 12)
- **Forge Records**: Detailed logs show the regular shipment schedule and typical delivery times
- **Previous Delays**: This is the first time in two years a caravan has been more than one day late
- **Ore Quality**: Star-iron ore is extremely valuable and difficult to replace
- **Payment Records**: Evidence of advance payment to Caravan Master Dolrim

#### Gathering Information in Town (Persuasion DC 15)
- **Market District Gossip**: Rumors of increased bandit activity along Tradeway Road
- **Guard Reports**: Patrols have been reduced due to budget constraints
- **Merchant Concerns**: Other traders avoiding the road due to recent incidents
- **Local Tensions**: Some townspeople resentful of resource allocation to guard equipment

#### Questioning Witnesses
**Traveling Merchant Finn** (Found at The Copper Cup Tavern)
- Witnessed black smoke rising from the forest near Ambush Point three days ago
- Heard sounds of combat and screaming around midday
- Saw riders fleeing toward the Thornwood Hills
- Mentions seeing unfamiliar faces in town recently, asking about caravan schedules

**Stable Master Eckhart**
- Dolrim's horses were well-rested and in excellent condition
- Caravan guards seemed experienced and well-equipped
- Someone asked about Dolrim's departure time the night before he left
- The questioner paid gold for the information and left immediately

### Journey to the Ambush Site

#### Travel Encounter (Random Roll 1d6)
1-2: **Desperate Refugees** - Family fleeing bandit raids, seeking protection
3-4: **Rival Merchants** - Competitors hoping to fill Gareth's contracts if the party fails

#### Ambush Point Investigation
**Location**: A narrow section of Tradeway Road between dense forest and a steep cliff

**Evidence Available (Investigation DC varies):**

- **DC 13**: Wagon wheel tracks leading into the forest
- **DC 15**: Specific arrowhead fragments from northern-made crossbows
- **DC 18**: Hidden cache containing one crate of star-iron ore (overlooked by bandits)
- **DC 20**: Distinctive boot prints matching those of a town insider

**Combat Encounter**: **Scavenger Pack**
*2-4 wolves (depending on party size) attracted by the scent of blood*

**Environmental Hazards**:
- **Unstable cliff edge**: Dexterity save (DC 13) to avoid 2d6 falling damage
- **Hidden pit trap**: Perception DC 16 to notice, Dexterity save DC 15 to avoid 1d6 piercing damage

### Key Discoveries
1. **The Betrayal**: Evidence suggests someone in town provided information about the caravan's timing
