## Special Traits
**Hag Heads:** Each surviving head can always bite, but only one can use its special ability on the hydra-hag’s turn. Roll `dice: 1d5` at the start of the hydra-hag’s turn to determine which head is dominant (uses its special ability) that turn. If that head is gone, roll again until a surviving head is chosen. Hags are immune to all these effects.

**Flue Hag—Soot Breath:** The flue hag head belches out a 20-foot-cloud of blinding, choking soot. All creatures in the cloud must make a successful DC 15 Con saving throw or be blinded for 2 rounds.

**Green Hag—Mimicry:** The green hag head imitates a sound it has heard. This is largely a “gift” for the characters, who get a 1-round break from the more dangerous attacks of the other heads. If, however, the hydra-hag has heard a sound that has the potential to frighten or confuse characters— a friend screaming in pain, a trusted ally yelling for help—it uses that against the PCs, who must make successful DC 15 Wis saving throws to not be fooled by the sound.

**Mute Hag—Shaping Touch:** If mute hag’s bite attack hits and the creature fails its saving throw, in addition to the usual effect, the creature also suffers a debilitating change in its physical form. Roll `dice: 1d4`: 1 = speed halved (legs twisted or shortened), 2 = -2 on attacks (arms twisted or shortened), 3 = -2 on Perception checks (face altered so vision is obscured or distorted), 4 = -2 on Con saving throws (midsection compressed or distorted). These penalties are permanent until removed by greater restoration or comparable magic.

**Sea Hag—Evil Eye:** Every humanoid within 30 feet of the hydra-hag must make a successful DC 15 Wis saving throw or be frightened of the hydra-hag for 1 minute. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself with a success. Subsequent saves are made with tactical disadvantage while the sea hag head is alive and within sight.

**Winter Hag—Frost Breath:** The winter hag head exhales a 30-foot cone of frost. Every creature in the cone takes `dice: 4d6` cold damage and is blinded for 2 rounds. A successful DC 15 Dex saving throw halves the damage and prevents blindness.

**Multiple Heads:** An attack that does 20 or more damage destroys one of the hydra-hag’s heads, selected at random. For each head that’s missing at the start of the hydra-hag’s turn, roll `dice: 1d6`; on a roll of 5 or 6, that head grows back immediately. If all five heads are gone at the same time, the hydra-hag dies. While the hydra-hag has more than one head, it has tactical advantage on saving throws against blindness, charm, deafness, fright, stunning, and unconsciousness.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** They hydra-hag uses the special ability of one randomly-chosen head, then each of its surviving heads bites once.

**Melee Attack—Flue Hag Bite:** +7 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d8 + 4` piercing damage plus `dice: 1d6` fire damage.

**Melee Attack—Green Hag Bite:** +7 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d8 + 4` piercing damage.

**Melee Attack—Mute Hag Bite:** +7 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d8 + 4` piercing damage, and a creature must make a successful DC 18 Wis saving throw or have tactical disadvantage on attacks against the hydra-hag until the end of the creature’s next turn.

**Melee Attack—Sea Hag Bite:** +7 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d8 + 4` piercing damage, and a creature must make a successful DC 15 Wis saving throw or be frightened of the hydra-hag until the end of the creature’s next turn.

**Melee Attack—Winter Hag Bite:** +7 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d8 + 4` piercing damage plus `dice: 1d10` cold damage.

## Description
**Environment**: Urban (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary

Considered a “successful” experiment in the unnatural manipulation of living flesh, the hydra-hag is a truly horrifying creature. The fact that it has managed to breed true is additionally disturbing, especially when one stops to consider what serves as its breeding stock. Not many such creatures are known to prowl the byways of the city, but those who do know are well advised to stay clear. The personalities of the different heads of a hydra-hag vie for control, and while one day a hydra-hag may feel content to root through the garbage of a landfill or simply enjoy the eddies and currents of Sister Lyme, it is just as likely to unleash its powers at any moment upon those who had previously allied with it. The fact that the hydra-hag’s diet other than rats and stray cats is humanoids — especially street urchins — is not lost on most who encounter them and live to tell of it. However, despite their abominable appearance, hydra-hags are adept at staying out of sight during the day, so the half-hearted efforts made in the past to find them and round them up have met with limited success.

The five differing heads of the hydra-hag make its daily life a constant battle for control and does a lot to ensure that the creatures not truly rise to power in the city’s underworld. They are too fractured within their own minds to manage much in the way of an organized plan. The heads of a hydra-hag cannot constitute a coven on their own, and multiple hydra-hags together have proven unable to do so either because of the chaos inherent to that many disparate personalities. Hydra-hags are universally corpulently obese, which has much to do with having five different mouths that all crave to be fed but only one body between them to process what is eaten. And without the massive body or metabolism of a true hydra, they are simply not able to handle their intake. It is not at all uncommon to find a hydra-hag vomiting its last meal from multiple heads as its gastric system rebels at the abuse. Whether this contributes to their overall surliness is suspect, but they clearly lead a very uncomfortable existence in the unnatural form they were given. Despite their notoriously voracious appetites, hydra-hags actually have bite attacks only with two of their heads — the mute hag head and the flue hag head. Only the flue hag head has the searing bite.

Hydra-hags stand about 6 feet high at the shoulder with another 3 feet of neck and head. They typically weigh close to 350 pounds.
