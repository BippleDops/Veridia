# Contagion
*5th-level, Necromancy*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 7 days

Your touch inflicts a magical contagion. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take `11d8` Necrotic damage and have the [Poisoned](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition. Also, choose one ability when you cast the spell. While [Poisoned](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned), the target has [Disadvantage](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on saving throws made with the chosen ability.

The target must repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns until it gets three successes or failures. If the target succeeds on three of these saves, the spell ends on the target. If the target fails three of the saves, the spell lasts for 7 days on it.

Whenever the [Poisoned](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) target receives an effect that would end the [Poisoned](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition, the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the [Poisoned](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition doesn't end on it.

**Classes**: [Druid](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Paladin (Oathbreaker)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-oathbreaker-dmg.md "subclass=DMG;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Cleric](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)

## Adventure Hooks

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
