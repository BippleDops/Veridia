## Description

A flint dagger, Tinderstrike is uncommonly sharp, and sparks cascade off its edge whenever it strikes something solid. Its handle is always warm to the touch, and the blade smolders for `dice: 1d4` minutes after it is used to deal damage. It contains a spark of [[Imix]], Prince of Evil Fire.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra `dice: 2d6` fire damage.

**Fire Mastery** You gain the following benefits while you hold Tinderstrike:

- You can speak Ignan fluently.
- You have resistance to fire damage.

You can cast [[dominate monster]]  (save DC 17) on a [[fire elemental}. Once you have done so, Tinderstrike can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

**Dance of the All-Consuming Fire** While inside a fire node, you can perform a ritual called the Dance of the All-Consuming Fire, using Tinderstrike to create a [[devastation orb of fire]]. Once you perform the ritual, Tinderstrike can't be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn.

**Flaw** Tinderstrike makes its wielder impatient and rash. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I act without thinking and take risks without weighing the consequences."
