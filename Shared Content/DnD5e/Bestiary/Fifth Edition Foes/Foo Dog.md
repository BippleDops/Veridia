## Special Traits
**Aura:** A foo dog is protected by an aura of goodness. An evil-aligned creature that attacks a foo creature takes a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls.

**Invisibility:** A foo dog can become invisible as a bonus action. It becomes visible again when it attacks.

**Planar Travel:** A foo dog can shift between the Astral, Ethereal, and Material Planes during its move. Crossing the boundary from one plane to another costs the foo dog 30 feet of movement. It can transport only itself into or out of the Ethereal Plane, but it can bring up to eight other willing creatures with it across the Astral boundary, with effects and restrictions identical to the astral projection spell.

**Resilient:** A foo dog has tactical advantage on all saving throws.

**Strike Evil:** Foo dogs have a +2 bonus on attack and damage rolls when fighting evil-aligned creatures.

**Summon Foo Creatures (1/Day):** Once per day as an action, a foo dog can summon up to four additional foo dogs by barking for them. Roll `dice: 4d4`; one foo dog appears within 20 feet of the summoning foo dog for each die that rolls a 4. Foo dogs summoned this way can't summon more foo dogs.

## Description
Foo dogs are extraplanar creatures that serve as guardians to those of good alignment. They are rarely encountered on the Material Plane, but when they are, they are always in the employ of a good-aligned creature, acting as either a companion or guardian. A foo dog never associates with creatures of evil alignment. It tolerates those of neutral alignment—barely.

A foo dog has the body of a large dog but its head is oversized, fierce, and distinctly un-canine in appearance. Some people say it more closely resembles a stylized lion, but others see a stronger resemblance to an ogre mage, or no resemblance to any other creature at all. It has large, intense, bulging eyes, outward-curving fangs, bushy eyebrows, a flattened nose, and pointed ears. Most foo dogs range in color from black to deep gold, though a few have been encountered that were pure white in color. They speak Celestial in a surprisingly deep voice. Sometimes they pick up other languages as well, depending on how widely they’ve traveled and who they’ve served.
