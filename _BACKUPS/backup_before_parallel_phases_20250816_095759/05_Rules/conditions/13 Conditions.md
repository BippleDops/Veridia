--- # Conditions

*Source: Adventurer's Codex (2014), p. 289* Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as [[conditions#Blinded|blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as [conditions#Invisible|invisible]], can be advantageous. A condition lasts either until it is countered (the [[conditions#prone|prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition. If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't. For a full list of the conditions, see the conditions page. The conditions are:- [conditions#Blinded|blinded]] - [[conditions#Charmed|charmed - [conditions#Deafened|deafened]] - [[conditions#Exhaustion|exhaustion - [conditions#frightened|frightened]] - [[conditions#Grappled|grappled - [conditions#Incapacitated|incapacitated]] - [[conditions#Invisible|invisible - [conditions#Paralyzed|paralyzed]] - [[conditions#Petrified|petrified - [conditions#Poisoned|poisoned]] - [[conditions#prone|prone - [conditions#Restrained|restrained]] - [[conditions#Stunned|stunned - [conditions#Unconscious|unconscious]] ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary 13 conditions is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of 13 conditions as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around 13 conditions. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Shadow Covenant - Achieve immortality ## Plot Hooks - A prisoner has gone missing and evil awakens
