### Search Strategies

#### Finding Content Fast
1. **Use Grep for text search**: Search content within files
2. **Use Glob for file patterns**: Find files by name pattern
3. **Check Bases first**: Structured data is faster to query
4. **Follow naming conventions**: Predictable paths save time

#### Common Search Patterns
```bash
# Find all NPCs in a campaign
Glob: "01_Campaigns/*/NPCs/*.md"

# Find all sessions mentioning a character
Grep: "Marina" in "01_Campaigns/*/Sessions/"

# Find all crystal-related mechanics
Grep: "crystal" in "03_Rules_Reference/"

# Find faction information
Glob: "**/Factions/*.md"
```

## üîó Content Relationships
