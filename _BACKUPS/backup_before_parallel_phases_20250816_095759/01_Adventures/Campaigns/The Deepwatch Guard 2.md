# The Deepwatch Guard
*Elite Sentinels Against the Darkness Below*

## Overview
The Deepwatch Guard serves as Aquabyssos's most specialized military unit, trained specifically to combat shadow corruption, deep-sea aberrations, and threats that emerge from the darkest depths of the realm. Unlike the regular [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Depth Wardens, who focus on general military defense, the Deepwatch Guard specializes in enemies that conventional forces cannot effectively engage—creatures of living shadow, manifestations of [02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]]'s influence, and horrors that defy normal military tactics.
