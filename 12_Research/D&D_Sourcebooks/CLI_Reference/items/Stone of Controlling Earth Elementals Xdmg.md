--- # Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals

*Wondrous item, rare* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/stone-of-controlling-earth-elementals.webp#right) While touching this 5-pound stone to the ground, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to summon an [[Earth Elemental Xmm]]. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your [[Initiative Xphb]] count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a [[Action Xphb]]. The stone can't be used this way again until the next dawn. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 312.
