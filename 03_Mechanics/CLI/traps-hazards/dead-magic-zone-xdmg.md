# Dead Magic Zone
*Environmental Hazard*  

A dead magic zone is an area where the fabric of magic is torn. The effect is the same as the [Antimagic Field](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/antimagic-field-xphb.md) spell, except that it is permanent and typically covers an area no more than 300 feet in diameter.
