# Elonia's Glamer (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *1st-level*

**School**: *illusion*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of ruby dust and a pinch of chalk dust)

**Duration**: 3 hours


## Effects
You subtly change the appearance of yourself or one other humanoid, making that person more or less attractive. This does not make that person look like someone else. Rather, for the positive version, makes the targetâ€™s eyes appear to sparkle, their skin clearer and smoother, their teeth straighter and whiter, and their hair thicker and more lustrous; or for the negative version, makes the person seem lackluster and unkempt. An unwilling target may make a Wisdom saving throw to resist.

While the positive version of this spell is active, the target has advantage on all Charisma ability checks designed to illicit a positive reaction. While the negative version of this spell is active, the target has disad-vantage on all Charisma ability checks.
