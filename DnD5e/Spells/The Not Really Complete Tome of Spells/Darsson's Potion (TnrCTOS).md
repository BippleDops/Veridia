# Darsson's Potion (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a vial of clean water)

**Duration**: 1 hour


## Effects
You cast this spell on a vial of water, and then immediately cast another spell on the vial. The second spell must be of 3rd level or lower and must have a range of Self or Touch. Rather than take effect immediately, the second spell is absorbed into the water, creating a temporary “potion.” This potion lasts for 1 hour before both spells go inert.
