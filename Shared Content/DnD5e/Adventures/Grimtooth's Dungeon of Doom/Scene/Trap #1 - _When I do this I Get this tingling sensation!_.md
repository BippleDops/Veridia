# Trap #1 - "When I do this I Get this tingling sensation!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The capstone is 10 feet in diameter. It is set tightly enough into the stone collar that it is just possible to insert a crowbar, or such like implement of destruction into the gap around the edge. (Note: If the party is foolish enough to use sword points they have a 10% chance of breaking their weapons. (L 1)) With suitable grunts and groans they will be able to pry the stone up high enough out of the stone collar to grasp the edge. With the applied strength equal to that of 8 average men they should be able to move the stone aside.
> 
> If they try to peek in around the stone before they attempt to move it the darkness will not permit them to see any great detail. That is unless they lift the stone high enough which will, of course, set off the trap.
> 
> As the party lifts the capstone clear they will be treated to one of the cleverest nonmagical "Zap" traps available.
> 
> The underside of the capstone is covered with a thin layer of copper plate. This plating goes all the way to the edge. If the stone is lifted by hand it will be impossible to do so without touching this copper plate.
> 
> In the center of the underside of the capstone is an axle on which is mounted a 5 foot copper-coated lodestone disk in such a way that it will spin freely. (Don't ask me wherehe got a lodestone - at least it is non-magic.) Out from the axle is fixed a long thin copper brush making a radius of the copper disk and just touching it. Wound around the axle is 200 feet of a fine elfish rope that is resistant to the ravages of time. This rope passes over a pulley also mounted on the bottom of the capstone, and thence on to a 20 pound stone weight set in an alcove carved 4 feet below the lip of thb stone collar. Also fastened to the same peg as the pulley is a thin piece of thread which runs with very little slack to a ring bolt set in a tiny wedge that prevents the 20 pound weight from falling into the long dark shaft below. (See illustration.) There is one last little item, fastened to the bottom of the capstone. On the opposite side from the pulley there is, fastened by a copper pin, a thin copper thread. This thread trails into the depths about 7 feet where it is fastened to the wall with a copper peg, this is the "ground" wire!

> plummet into the abyss. This turns the copper disk at a fairly good clip against the brush on the capstone's copper plated bottom. A static electric spark of fair proportions will be generated and short out through the fingers of the delvers! The charge should be fatal to any character with a below average constitution, or any one with a heart condition. (Right! A delver with a heart condition, be still my beating heart!) It should knock those with average constitutions on their kiesters. Those who are stout of heart, and great of wind and limb might just hang on despite the jolt of electricity, but remember there is a 20 pound stone dropping 200 feet involved here, the jerk as it hits should cause even the greatest "hero" to loose his grip and drop the capstone.

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> (**Note:** Leather gloves will mitigate the effect of the charge, metal gauntlets will have the exact opposite effect, and remember the jerk of the stone at the end.) 
> 
> The beauty of this is that the stone is now harmless, but the party need not know this. They can be presented with this as a sign that the power ofEvinrood reaches beyond the grave.

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The second trap is located at the bottom of the shaft. The party will be taken somewhat aback by the capstone trap, after they have plucked up enough courage to finally displace the capstone they will be confronted by a deep, dark, seemingly bottomless shaft opening into the ground. If they have any wits at all they will find at their disposal a 200 foot length of elfish rope (very strong, light, and obviously not subject to the ravages of time.) Keep in mind there is a 20 pound weight fastened to the end. The first thing the party is likely to do is drop the stone sans rope into the abyss. If they do or drop such other items as they choose they will, after a brief pause, hear a splash. A descent will be necessary.
> 
> At this point it is important to remind you, my cohort in chaos, that this Tomb is not lighted in any fashion. It behooves you to make sure the delvers are aware of this fact. Even with the light of lamps or torches it will be dim in most circumstances. Even at the bottom of a shaft open to the sun there is precious little light 225 feet down!

Remind them frequently, the reasons for this will be clear at a number of points.
