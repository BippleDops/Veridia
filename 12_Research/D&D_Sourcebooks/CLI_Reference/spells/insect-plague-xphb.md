# Insect Plague
*5th-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a locust)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Swarming locusts fill a 20-foot-radius [[sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]] centered on a point you choose within range. The [[sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]] remains for the duration, and its area is [[lightly-obscured-xphb|Lightly Obscured]] and [[difficult-terrain-xphb|Difficult Terrain]].

When the swarm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `4d10` Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d10` for each spell slot level above 5.

**Classes**: [[list-spells-classes-druid|Druid]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"|Sorcerer (Divine Soul)]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-fiend-patron-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Warlock (Fiend Patron)]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-nature-domain "class=XPHB"|Cleric (Nature Domain)]]; [[list-spells-classes-cleric|Cleric]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-tempest-domain "class=XPHB"|Cleric (Tempest Domain)]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-circle-of-the-land-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Druid (Circle of the Land)]]; [[list-spells-classes-sorcerer|Sorcerer]]; [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]
