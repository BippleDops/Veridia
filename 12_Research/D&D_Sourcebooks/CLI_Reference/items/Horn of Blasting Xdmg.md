--- # Horn of Blasting

*Wondrous item, rare* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/horn-of-blasting.webp#right) You can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot [[Area of Effect Xphb]] that is audible out to 600 feet. Each creature in the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes`5d8`Thunder damage and has the [[conditions#Deafened|Deafened]] condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. Glass or crystal objects in the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] that aren't being worn or carried take`10d8`Thunder damage. Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals`10d6`Force damage to the user and destroys the horn. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 270.
