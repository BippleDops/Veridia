# Old Sally Seasprayer

**Type:** Sea Oracle/Folk Healer  
**Location:** [[The Tidepool Markets]] - [[Abyssos Prime]]  
**World:** [[Aquabyssos]]  
**Occupation:** Oracle, Healer, and Keeper of Sea Lore  
**Race:** Sea Hag (Transformed Human)  
**Alignment:** Chaotic Good

*"The sea remembers everything, child. Every tear, every prayer, every promise broken on the waves. I just listen to what it has to say."*

## Overview
Old Sally Seasprayer is one of [[Abyssos Prime]]'s most respected and feared folk figures, a sea oracle whose prophecies have guided countless souls through the treacherous waters of both fate and the literal depths of [[Aquabyssos]]. Operating from a ramshackle stall in [[The Tidepool Markets]], she dispenses wisdom, healing, and glimpses of the future to anyone brave enough to seek her counsel.

What makes Sally unique among the many fortune-tellers and mystics of the underwater city is the undeniable accuracy of her visions and the deep respect she commands from people of all social classes. Sailors refuse to embark on dangerous journeys without her blessing, merchants consult her before major investments, and even members of [[Parliament of Echoes]] have been known to seek her guidance during times of crisis.

## Physical Appearance
Sally appears as an elderly woman whose appearance has been dramatically altered by decades of exposure to deep-sea magic and communion with oceanic forces. Her skin has taken on a blue-green tint with patterns that shift like flowing water, while her hair has become living kelp that moves independently in response to emotional currents and magical energies.

Her eyes are perhaps her most striking feature - completely white like pearls, yet somehow still capable of sight that penetrates far beyond the physical realm. When she speaks prophecy, they glow with a soft bioluminescent light that reflects the depths of her mystical connection to the sea.

She dresses in layers of flowing fabric that seem to be made from various sea materials - kelp fibers, woven sea grass, and what might be processed jellyfish membranes. These materials shift and change color based on her mood and the intensity of her visions, creating an constantly evolving display that fascinates and sometimes frightens those who visit her.

## Background and Transformation

### The Surface Life
Before the Great Drowning, Sally was known as Sarah Waverly, a lighthouse keeper's daughter who lived on the coast and had always felt an unusual connection to the sea. Even then, she was known locally as someone who could predict storms and had an uncanny ability to sense when ships were in distress.

### The Drowning and Change
During the Great Drowning, Sally was caught in one of the most powerful magical surges that reshaped the world. Instead of drowning or being transformed like most surface dwellers, she underwent a more profound change - becoming something between human and sea spirit, gaining the ability to communicate directly with the oceanic forces that now ruled the world.

### The Early Years
In the chaotic early years of [[Aquabyssos]], Sally's abilities made her invaluable to the struggling survivors. She could predict where fresh water might be found, warn of dangerous creatures, and provide guidance about which areas were safe for settlement. Her reputation grew as her prophecies proved consistently accurate and helpful.

### Evolution into Oracle
As [[Abyssos Prime]] developed from refugee camp to proper city, Sally's role evolved from survival advisor to full oracle. Her understanding of the sea's mysteries deepened, and she began to receive visions not just about immediate dangers but about the long-term fate of individuals and the underwater civilization itself.

## The Oracle's Stall

### Physical Setup
**Location**: A corner spot in [[The Tidepool Markets]] where multiple currents converge, creating natural eddies that enhance magical perception.

**Structure**: Built from driftwood, coral formations, and salvaged ship parts, the stall seems to grow organically from the seafloor while providing shelter and privacy for consultations.

**Mystical Elements**: Surrounded by pools of water from different depths and locations, each serving as a scrying medium for different types of visions.

**Protective Wards**: The area is protected by both natural sea spirits and Sally's own magic, ensuring that clients can speak freely without fear of eavesdropping.

### The Consultation Space

> [!danger] DM Secret
> Sally's prophetic powers come with a terrible cost - every true prophecy she speaks shortens her own lifespan. She has calculated that she has perhaps two years of active prophecy remaining before the drain on her life force becomes fatal. She is desperately searching for a successor who can inherit her abilities and responsibilities, but the transformation process requires the candidate to willingly sacrifice their humanity just as she did. Her increasing urgency to resolve major threats to [[Aquabyssos]] stems from knowing that her time to guide and protect the community is rapidly running out, and she fears what will happen to her people without prophetic guidance in the dangerous times ahead.
