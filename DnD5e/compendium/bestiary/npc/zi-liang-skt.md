## Description

Zi Liang is a devout worshiper of Chauntea, the Earth Mother. She has considerably less faith in Goldenfields' defenders, so she patrols the temple-farm during her off-duty hours.

Ideal:"If we faithfully tend to our gardens and our fields, Chauntea will smile upon us."

Bond:"Goldenfields is the breadbasket of the North. People depend on its safety and prosperity, and I'll do what must be done to protect it."

Flaw:"I don't trust authority. I do what my heart says is right."
