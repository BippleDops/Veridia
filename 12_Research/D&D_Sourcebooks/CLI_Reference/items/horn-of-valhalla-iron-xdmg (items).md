# Horn of Valhalla, Iron
*Wondrous item, legendary*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/horn-of-valhalla.webp#right)

You can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you. Each spirit uses the [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/berserker xmm|Berserker]] stat block and returns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]]. The spirits look like living, breathing warriors, and they have [[immunity xphb|Immunity]] to the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] and [[conditions#frightened|Frightened]] conditions. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

A iron horn summons 5 [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/berserker xmm|Berserkers]]. To use the iron horn, you must have [[proficiency xphb|Proficiency]] with all Martial weapons.

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/berserker xmm|Berserkers]] attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are [[friendly-attitude-xphb|Friendly]] to you and your allies and follow your commands.
