# Conditions
*Source: Player's Handbook (2014), p. 289* 

Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Blinded|blinded]], are impairments, but a few, such as [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Invisible|invisible]], can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Prone|prone]] condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

For a full list of the conditions, see the conditions page. The conditions are:- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Blinded|blinded]]  - [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Charmed|charmed]]  - [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Deafened|deafened]]  - [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Exhaustion|exhaustion]]  - [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Frightened|frightened]]  - [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Grappled|grappled]]  - [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Incapacitated|incapacitated]]  - [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Invisible|invisible]]  - [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Paralyzed|paralyzed]]  - [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Petrified|petrified]]  - [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Poisoned|poisoned]]  - [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Prone|prone]]  - [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Restrained|restrained]]  - [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Stunned|stunned]]  - [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Unconscious|unconscious]]

## Player-Facing Summary

13 conditions is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of 13 conditions as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around 13 conditions.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties 13 conditions to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at 13 conditions to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to 13 conditions active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
