# Midnight Tears
*Adventuring gear, poison (ingested)*  


- **Properties**: [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties#Poison|Poison]]
- **Cost**: 1,500 gp

A creature that ingests Midnight Tears suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. Any effect that ends the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition neutralizes this poison. If the poison hasn't been neutralized before midnight, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (`9d6`) Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
