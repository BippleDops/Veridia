--- # Chapter 4: Character Origins

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024), p. 176* !] This chapter describes the two components of an adventurer's origin: "background" and "species". Together, these elements suggest your character's early experience and family origin before taking up the adventuring life and learning the capabilities of a class (described in "chapter 3"). ## üîß Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Origin Components Each part of your character's origin reflects facets of your character, their life, and the circumstances that started them on the path to adventure. If you choose a background or a species from an older book, see the sidebar ""Backgrounds and Species from Older Books"" in "chapter 2" for how to use them with the options here. ### Character Backgrounds Your character's background is a collection of characteristics that represent the place and occupation that were most formative before your character embarked on a life of adventure. Each background includes a brief narrative of what your character's past might have been like. Alter the details of this narrative however you like. #### Parts of a Background A background includes the following parts. ##### Ability Scores A background lists three of your character's ability scores. Increase one by 2 and another one by 1, or increase all three by 1. None of these increases can raise a score above 20. ##### Feat A background gives your character a specified Origin feat (described in "chapter 5"). ##### Skill Proficiencies A background gives your character proficiency in two specified skills. ##### Tool Proficiency Each background gives a character proficiency with one tool‚Äîeither a specific tool or one chosen from the Artisan's Tools category. Tools are detailed in "chapter 6". ##### Equipment Each background offers a choice between a package of equipment and 50 GP. ### Character Species When you choose your character's species, you determine whether your character is a human or a member of a fantastical species, such as dragonborn or gnome. The peoples of the D&D multiverse hail from different worlds and include many kinds of sapient life forms. A player character's species is the set of game traits that an adventurer gains from being one of those life forms. Some species can trace their origin to a single world, plane of existence, or god, while other species first appeared in multiple realms at once. Whatever a species' genesis, its members have spread across the multiverse and contribute to many different cultures. Members of most species live for about 80 years, with exceptions noted in the text about the species in this chapter. Regardless of life span, members of all species reach physical maturity at about the same age. Your character can be any age that isn't beyond their species' normal life span. #### Parts of a Species A species includes the following parts. ##### Creature Type A character's species determines the character's creature type, which is described in the rules glossary. Every species in this chapter is Humanoid; playable non-Humanoid species appear in other D&D books. ##### Size Your character's species determines the character's size. Individuals within a species cover a wide range of heights, and some species include such diversity of size that you can choose whether your character is Small or Medium. ##### Speed Your character's species determines the character's Speed. ##### Special Traits Each species gives a character special traits‚Äîunique characteristics based on the species' physiology or magical nature. When you choose a species, your character gets all the special traits listed for it. Some traits involve making a choice from a handful of options. ## Background Descriptions Sixteen backgrounds are presented in this section in alphabetical order: - [[acolyte-xphb (backgrounds)]] - [[Artisan Xphb]] - [[charlatan-xphb (backgrounds)]] - [[criminal-xphb (backgrounds)]] - [[entertainer-xphb (backgrounds)]] - [[Farmer Xphb]] - [[guard-xphb (backgrounds)]] - [[guide-xphb (backgrounds)]] - [[hermit-xphb (backgrounds)]] - [[merchant-xphb (backgrounds)]] - [[noble-xphb (backgrounds)]] - [[sage-xphb (backgrounds)]] - [[Sailor Xphb]] - [[scribe-xphb (backgrounds)]] - [[soldier-xphb (backgrounds)]] - [[wayfarer-xphb (backgrounds)]] ## Species Descriptions Ten species are presented in this section in alphabetical order: [[List Spells Races Aasimar Xphb]], [[dragonborn-xphb (races)]], [[Dwarf Xphb]], [[elf-xphb (races)]], [[gnome-xphb (races)]], [[Goliath Xphb]], [[Halfling Xphb]], [[Human Xphb]], [[orc-xphb (races)]], and [[List Spells Races Tiefling Xphb]]. ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/books/players-handbook-2024/img/153-05-027-map-decoration.webp#center) ## Player-Facing Summary 05 chapter 4 character origins is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of 05 chapter 4 character origins as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens‚Äîshifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind‚Äîthat herald change around 05 chapter 4 character origins. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## Unearthed Arcana & Playtest Content ### Latest UA Documents
