# Curse of Lycanthropy (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a drop of blood from a true lycanthrope)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You touch a humanoid and turn it into an infected lycanthrope. The target may make a Constitution saving throw to avoid this spell. The exact species of lycanthrope depends on the nature and temperament of your target.

If your target fails its saving throw, then on the next full moon, it will transform each night of the three nights of the full moon. On the day after the third night, the subject may make another saving throw, with disadvantage unless the target failed to kill anything during those three nights.

This spell continues until the target suc-ceeds at three saving throws, although these saves do not need to be consecutive. A *remove curse* allows for an additional saving throw, or grants advantage on a monthly saving throw. A *greater restoration* removes this curse immediately.
