The entry for a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/monster-xphb|monster's]] attack starts by identifying whether the attack is a melee or a ranged attack and then provides the attack roll's bonus, its reach or range, and what happens on a hit.

## Damage Notation

A stat block usually provides both a static number and a die expression for each instance of damage. For example, an attack might deal 4 (`1d4 + 2`) damage on a hit. The DM determines whether you use the static number or the die expression in parentheses; you don't use both.
