> [!secret] DM Secret
> The pressure-tube system has an undocumented emergency protocol that can transform the entire network into a massive weapon. By reversing pressure flows and opening emergency vents simultaneously, the system could create devastating pressure waves capable of destroying entire city districts. This capability was built in during the original construction as a last-resort defense against invasion, but knowledge of it has been kept secret by a small group of senior engineers and government officials. The activation codes are hidden within the terminal's deepest maintenance levels.
