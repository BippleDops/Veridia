# Tailors' Corner
## Overview
The handiwork of the weaver, the seamstress, and the tailor appears on every body throughout Toril. If it is true as they say that “A ruff makes a nobleman and a slop makes a fool,” then we all owe our station, in part, to the cloth and clothes makers. 

To them I offer every item they need to ply their trade. All of the fabrics I offer come from the fine cities of Berdusk, Daerlun, Elturel, Nexal, Scornubel, Sutail, and Yhaunn, and the furs from trappers and rangers across the Heartlands and beyond.
