*No larger than a mountain lion, this dusky gray, leonine creature slinks through the shadows, its humanlike head set in a scowl of concentration, its batlike wings folded neatly against its flanks. It holds its tail aloft, and the tip of it gleams with the dull glint of unpolished iron.*

**Organization**: Solitary

The successful infusion of the chameleonlike abilities of a skulk into a line of manticores has proven to be a useful and popular experiment in Castorhage. The resulting breed is smaller than a typical manticore and much more discreet in its presence. The inherent cowardliness of skulks seems to also have had an effect, removing much of the wildness found in manticores and making then much more biddable and useful as guardian beasts but without making them craven or too skittish to fight off intruders if needed. Oftentimes owners have them broken (see the [[Broken Creature]] template in Appendix B) to ensure their docility toward their masters.

A skulking manticore has a featureless gray hide that is able to adopt the color of its surroundings like a chameleon. A typical skulking manticore is 4 feet long and weighs 120 pounds.
