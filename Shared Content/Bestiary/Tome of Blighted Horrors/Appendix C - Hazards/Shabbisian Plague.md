# Shabbisian Plague
## Overview
```ad-warning
title: GM Directions
collapse: open
Victims of Shabbisian Plague begin experiencing symptoms `dice: 3d4` hours after being bitten by the carrier, whether it be a rat or some tiny insect such as a flea or mosquito. Its victims experience high fever and suffer teeth-rattling chills while at the same time their muscles spasm painfully and tendons tighten, causing limbs to draw up into an almost fetal position. In addition, the victim develops a purplish rash on cheeks, forehead, neck, armpits, and groin that eventually blisters and breaks open, causing oozing wounds that leave scars and can lead to further serious infections. Those that recover from the plague usually bear discolored scars from this rash as a memento, and frequently move with an uneven gait or have a slightly twisted arm caused by permanent tendon damage.

The victim’s Dexterity is reduced by `dice: 1d4` and Charisma is reduced by `dice: 1d2` when the symptoms kick in. The victim must make a successful DC 15 Con saving throw after completing each long rest or lose another `dice: 1d4` Dexterity and `dice: 1d2` Charisma. The disease ends if the character’s Con saving throw succeeds two days in a row.

After a victim recovers from Shabbisian plague, the disease comes back `dice: 2d4` days later unless a successful DC 10 Con saving throw is made at that time. Subsequent bouts are identical to the first bout, except the DC for daily Con saves is 10. The disease always recurs `dice: 2d4` days after recovery until the initial DC 10 Con saving throw succeeds and staves it off permanently, or it’s cured with lesser restoration or comparable magic.
