# Wallow-Whale
## Overview
### Wallow-Whale
![[hvmjazs0.icn.png|Wallow-Whale|300]]
[[hvmjazs0.icn.png|open outside]]

*Something stirs in the sludge beneath, swimming through the arsenic poison that passes for water. It is vast, a seething globe of flesh, a mountain of rotting skin that hangs like a bridal train behind its back. It has at least a dozen eyes oddly spaced on its foul body, and a vast maw capable of swallowing a ship.*

## Special Traits
**Swallow:** A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained. It takes `dice: 1d10 + 6` bludgeoning damage plus `dice: 1d8` acid damage automatically at the start of each of the wallow-whale’s turns. Any number of creatures can be inside the wallow-whale at one time. A swallowed creature is unaffected by anything happening outside the wallow-whale or by attacks from outside it. A swallowed creature can get out of the wallow-whale by using 5 feet of movement, but only after the wallow-whale is dead. When a creature gets out of the wallow-whale, it must make a successful DC 17 Con saving throw or contract filth fever.

**Filth Fever:** A creature with filth fever becomes sick `dice: 1d4` days after being infected. At that time, the creature gains 1 level of exhaustion. It also regains only half the usual number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from resting. Once symptoms appear, the infected creature must make a DC 11 Con saving throw after every long rest. If it fails, the creature gains 1 level of exhaustion; if it succeeds, the creature loses 1 level of exhaustion. The disease is cured when the creature has no exhaustion.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The wallow-whale bites once and makes one tail slap attack.

**Melee Attack—Bite:** +10 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 4d10 + 6` piercing damage plus `dice: 3d6` acid damage, and the creature must make a successful DC 17 Str saving throw or be swallowed (see below).

**Melee Attack—Tail Slap:** +10 to hit (reach 15 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 4d8 + 6` bludgeoning damage and the target is knocked prone.

**Melee Atttack—Ram (recharge 6):** automatic hit (one ship). Hit: the vessel makes a hull saving throw using the most appropriate DC from the table below, based on the ship’s type. The vessel sinks when it has failed the indicated number of saving throws. The proficiency bonus of the ship’s captain can be added to the saving throw.

## Description
**Environment**: Sea (Between)

**Organization**: Solitary or mated pair

Originally found only in the Unsea of Between before some of these great cetaceans somehow escaped and began reproducing in the mundane world’s oceans, wallow-whales are now the terror of the Fetid Sea and one of the primary threats for which the Castorhage Navy diligently patrols those waters. Wallow-whales are offal, carrion, husks, leavings, and scum given life. Stirges are frequently seen circling them when they surface to launch a spume of oily brine, purulence, and clotted fluids from their blowholes, and oozes capable of surviving in the acidic environment can sometimes be found infesting their cathedral-like stomachs. Wallow-whales aren’t afraid to venture close to the city to feed upon the excrement, rot, and flotsam that seethes like a gyre around its foundations. Yet despite their foul body habitus, the ambergris of a wallow-whale is a thing both rare and highly valuable, selling for as much as 100 gp/pound. Daring or foolhardy whalers armed with cold-iron harpoons hunt these beasts upon the oceans, and in some cases upon the Unsea, with typical Gargantuan specimens typically yielding `dice: 1d6` x 10 pounds of the substance, and a Colossal beast yielding `dice: 3d6` x 10 pounds.
