## Overview

Before the establishment of the [[Parliament of Echoes]], [[Aquabyssos]] was ruled by a series of monarchs whose reigns spanned from the pre-drowning era through the tumultuous centuries following [[The Great Drowning|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Drowning]]. These rulers, known collectively as the Drowned Dynasties, shaped the underwater civilization through periods of survival, adaptation, expansion, and eventually, the transition to democratic goverce.

The records of these ancient rulers are fragmented, preserved in  manipulation, and the chaos of the early drowning years.
