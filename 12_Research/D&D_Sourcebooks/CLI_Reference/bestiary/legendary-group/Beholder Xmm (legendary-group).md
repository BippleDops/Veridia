_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_ The region containing a beholder's lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects: - **Scopophobia.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair feel as if they're being watched. Any creature (excluding the beholder and its allies) that finishes a [[short-rest-xphb]] while within 1 mile of the lair must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or gain no benefit from that rest. - **Warping Terrain.** Minor warps in reality occur near the lair; any creature (excluding the beholder) within 1 mile of the lair that makes a [[d20-test-xphb (variant-rules)]] and rolls a 1 has the [[conditions#prone|Prone]] condition. If the beholder dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. ## Player-Facing Summary Beholder xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of beholder xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around beholder xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Secret Covenant - Summon ancient evil ## Plot Hooks - Someone is blackmailing a witness for love
