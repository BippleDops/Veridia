# Parliament of Echoes
## Where Yesterday's Voices Decide Tomorrow's Fate

> *"In these halls, every word spoken echoes forever, and every vote cast weighs down reality itself."*

## 🏛️ Overview
The Parliament of Echoes serves as Aquabyssos's theoretical government, where ghost senators debate laws that apply to no one, yet somehow affect everyone. Built from crystallized sound and frozen time, the building exists in multiple temporal states simultaneously.

## 🗺️ Geography & Architecture

### Exterior
- **Structure**: Inverted pyramid pointing downward
- **Material**: Crystallized screams and legislative speeches
- **Size**: 500 feet wide at top, narrowing to 50 feet at bottom
- **Entrance**: Through the Bubble Gates (must speak intention)
- **Defenses**: Temporal loops trap uninvited guests

### The Five Levels

#### Level 1: The Public Galleries
- **Purpose**: Citizens observe (but cannot affect) proceedings
- **Features**: 
  - Viewing pools showing past and future debates
  - Echo chambers where old speeches replay
  - The Complaint Choir (citizens' grievances in harmony)
- **Hazard**: Memory bleed from prolonged exposure

#### Level 2: The Debate Floor
- **Purpose**: Active legislative sessions
- **Temporal State**: Past, present, and future overlap
- **Features**:
  - Central podium exists in all timelines
  - Faction seating that shifts with alliances
  - The Speaker's Throne (empty for 200 years)
- **NPCs**: [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Senator Glaucus|02 Worldbuilding/People/Senator Glaucus]], [[Time-Lost Delegate Chronus]]

#### Level 3: The Vote Vaults
- **Purpose**: Physical storage of all votes ever cast
- **Mechanics**: Votes have literal weight
  - Yes votes: Pearl spheres (lighter than air)
  - No votes: Obsidian cubes (incredibly heavy)
- **Secret**: Timeline B section (votes from erased timeline)
- **Guardian**: Law Constructs (crystallized legislation)

#### Level 4: The Amnesia Gallery
- **Purpose**: The Forgotten Faction's domain
- **Effect**: Memories become fluid here
- **Features**:
  - Memory pools (can trade memories)
  - Identity mirrors (show who you forgot you were)
  - The Archive of the Unremembered
- **Inhabitants**: [[The Forgotten Representative]]

#### Level 5: The Foundation Depths
- **Purpose**: Unknown (sealed 200 years ago)
- **Rumors**: 
  - Contains the original government in stasis
  - Portal to pre-flood surface world
  - The true Parliament that this echoes
- **Access**: Requires unanimous vote (impossible)

## 🎭 Factions & Politics

### Active Factions

#### The Drowned Coalition
- **Belief**: Death by water is the pure state
- **Seats**: 47
- **Leader**: Senator Aqueous (literally made of water)
- **Goal**: Mandatory drowning for all citizens

#### The Transformed
- **Belief**: Evolution to aquatic forms is destiny
- **Seats**: 52
- **Leader**: [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Duke Cyrus Reefheart|02 Worldbuilding/People/Duke Cyrus Reefheart]]

- **Belief**: Sink everything further
- **Seats**: 38
- **Leader**: Pressure Prophet Depth-Mad
- **Goal**: Reach the planet's core

#### The Forgotten
- **Belief**: Unknown (they forgot)

- **Leader**: [[The Forgotten Representative]]
- **Goal**: Forgotten (but they still pursue it)

### Shadow Parliament
A parallel body of shadows that meets in the same space but different phase:
