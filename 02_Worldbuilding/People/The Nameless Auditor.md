# The Nameless Auditor
*Master of Secrets, The Information Broker Supreme*

## Overview
The Nameless Auditor serves as the "Scale of Information" on the [[Silverscale Consortium]]'s Board of Scales, controlling the organization's vast intelligence network and information-gathering operations. Their true identity, appearance, and even gender remain unknown—they appear differently to each person who meets them, and their name changes with each interaction.

## Horror Elements & Dark Secrets

- Their true personality may be completely buried under accumulated identities
- Sometimes acts out fragments of absorbed personalities involuntarily
- May have forgotten their own original name and history
- Could be nothing more than a vessel containing thousands of other people's identities

### The Surveillance Curse
