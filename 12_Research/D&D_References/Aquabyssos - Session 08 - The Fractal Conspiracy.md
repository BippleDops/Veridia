# Session 8: The Fractal Conspiracy
## Through Infinite Realities

> *"In the fractals, every choice you didn't make is waiting for you."*

## üé¨ Strong Start
The party enters the Fractal Forests to find themselves in multiple realities simultaneously. In one, they're victorious heroes. In another, they're shadow-possessed villains. In a third, they never existed at all. [[Lord Flux the Inconsistent]] greets them‚Äîall of them‚Äîat once: "Welcome to every possibility. The Singers Beyond can't find what exists everywhere and nowhere. But first, you must choose which reality you want to save."

## üé≠ Scenes

### Scene 1: The Probability Prison
**Location**: [[Vorthak]] Fragment in Crystallium  
**Situation**: Navigate contradicting realities  
**Conflict**: Each party member in different probability  
**Discoveries**:
- The fractal was created as a Singer trap
- Every choice creates a new recursion level
- Some versions of the party have already failed
- One version succeeded but destroyed Aquabyssos

**Probability Navigation**:
- Each PC rolls d20 for reality placement
- 1-5: Nightmare timeline (everything worse)
- 6-10: Twisted timeline (role reversals)
- 11-15: Canon timeline (current reality)
- 16-19: Optimal timeline (everything better)
- 20: Observer mode (see all timelines)

### Scene 2: The Parliament of Nobody
**Location**: [[Memoriam]] Recursion Layer  
**Situation**: Meet the forgotten government  
**Conflict**: They don't exist but make decisions  
**Discoveries**:
- They've been fighting Singers for centuries
- Nobody remembers because they erase themselves
- They have the Grief Bomb blueprints
- Cost: Someone must be forgotten forever

**Forgetting Mechanics**:
- Each hour in Memoriam: WIS save DC 16
- Failure: Forget one important memory
- Critical failure: Forget who you are
- Success: Remember something crucial

### Scene 3: Marina's Echo Chamber
**Location**: Quantum probability space  
**Situation**: All versions of Marina exist here  
**Conflict**: They're arguing about the solution  
**Discoveries**:
- 47 different Marinas from different timelines
- Each has part of the complete solution
- Shadow Marina and Original Marina must cooperate
- One Marina is actually a Singer spy

**The Marina Council**:
- Vote on which reality to preserve
- Each Marina has different information
- Wrong choice collapses several timelines
- Right choice requires sacrifice from all

### Scene 4: The Sorrowmaster's Depths
**Location**: [[The Mourning Depths]] - All recursions  
**Situation**: Retrieve the Grief Bomb  
**Conflict**: Must generate enough sorrow to power it  
**Discoveries**:
- The bomb is made from crystallized suffering
- It doesn't destroy‚Äîit makes things too sad to exist
- The Sorrowmaster is dying from joy (paradox)
- Activation requires experiencing every possible loss

**Sorrow Generation Challenge**:
- Each PC must confront worst fear
- Experience the death of loved ones
- Witness their failures across timelines
- Success generates Grief Points (need 100)

## üó°Ô∏è Combat Encounters

### Probability Spawn (Endless)
- **AS** Variable (10+d10)
- **HP** Variable (10d10)
- **Attacks** Random each round
- **Special**: Defeating one creates two in other timelines

### The Joy Plague (Anti-Combat)
- **Effect**: Forced happiness in Mourning Depths
- **Damage**: 1d8 psychic per round of joy
- **Save**: CHA DC 17 to feel appropriate sorrow
- **Cure**: Experience genuine grief

### Singer Fragment (First Contact)
- **AS** 22, **HP** 200
- **Immunity**: All damage except sorrow-infused
- **Reality Warp**: Changes rules each round
- **Existence Attack**: Erases things from reality
- **Weakness**: Grief Bomb prototype weapons

### Lord Flux (All Versions)
- **AS** 16-20 (depends on version)
- **HP** 80 per probability iteration
- **Special**: Exists in all timelines simultaneously
- **Defeat Condition**: Unite all versions

## üé≤ Environmental Madness

### Recursion Effects (Roll d12 each scene)
1. Gravity inverts
2. Time flows backward
3. Shadows lead, bodies follow
4. Thoughts become physical
5. Emotions swap between people
6. Dead versions of party appear
7. Future bleeds into present
8. Past overwrites present
9. NPCs become PCs
10. Reality becomes negotiable
11. Everything is underwater but breathable
12. Roll twice, both happen

### Memoriam Erasure
- Names disappear from memory
- Faces become generic
- Achievements are forgotten
- Relationships cease to exist
- Eventually, self is forgotten

## üí∞ Treasure & Rewards
- Grief Bomb Components
- Probability Map (navigate timelines)
- 2,000 [[Sorrow Pearls]] (crystallized tears)
- Marina's Complete Memory Set
- Flux Stabilizer (lock into one reality)
- Echo Chamber Key (access all recursions)

## üîç Secrets & Clues
1. The Singers Beyond are fleeing something worse
2. The Deep Mother was a Singer who chose to stay
3. Reality itself is recursive‚Äîinfinite layers down
4. The Parliament of Nobody has been guiding everything
5. Forgetting is the only defense against Singers
6. The Grief Bomb worked once before
7. Aquabyssos is the last unconsumed reality
8. Shadows are immune to Singer detection
9. The harvest creates Singer invisibility
10. One party member is from another timeline

## üîó Timeline Convergence Points

### Critical Decision
Party must choose which timeline becomes "real":
- **Timeline A**: Harvest succeeds, humanity survives as shadows
- **Timeline B**: Singers consume reality but are trapped
- **Timeline C**: Reality resets to pre-Cataclysm
- **Timeline D**: Merge all timelines into chaos
- **Timeline E**: Create new timeline from scratch

### The Cost
Each timeline choice requires sacrifice:
- Someone must cease to exist
- Someone must become forgotten
- Someone must merge with their shadow
- Someone must become a Singer
- Someone must stay in collapsed timeline

## üé™ Cliffhanger Ending
The party assembles the Grief Bomb as realities collapse around them. The Sorrowmaster, dying from paradoxical joy, whispers: "The bomb won't work as intended. It never does. But that's the point. Grief shared is grief halved. Grief weaponized is grief transformed."

Suddenly, ALL versions of Marina across ALL timelines speak in unison: "The Singers are here. Not coming‚ÄîHERE. They've been here all along. We've been inside one this entire time. Aquabyssos isn't a place‚Äîit's a Singer's stomach. We're being digested."

Lord Flux appears in singular form for the first time: "There's only one solution. We don't fight the Singer. We give it existential depression. We make it too sad to digest us. But someone has to deliver the bomb from inside its consciousness. Someone has to become the sorrow."

Through the fractured reality, the party sees the truth‚Äîmassive, incomprehensible forms surrounding all of Aquabyssos. They've been inside a Singer Beyond since the Cataclysm. The drowning wasn't water‚Äîit was digestive fluid. The pressure isn't depth‚Äîit's peristalsis.

Marina's echo speaks one last time: "The Mourning Depths knows the way. The Sorrowmaster isn't dying from joy‚Äîthey're ascending to become the delivery system. But they need an anchor in reality. They need someone who exists in multiple timelines. They need..." She looks directly at the party member with the most connections across realities.
