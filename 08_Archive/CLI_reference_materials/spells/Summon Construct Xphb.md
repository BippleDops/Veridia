# Summon Construct
*4th-level, Conjuration*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/summon-construct.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a lockbox worth 400+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth the spirit of a Construct. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the [Construct Spirit](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/construct-spirit-xphb.md) stat block. When you cast the spell, choose a material: Clay, Metal, or Stone. The creature resembles an animate statue (you determine the appearance) made of the chosen material, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your [Initiative](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [Dodge](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Dodge) action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.
