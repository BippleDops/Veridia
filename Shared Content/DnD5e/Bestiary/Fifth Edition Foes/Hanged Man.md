## Special Traits
**Entangle:** The hanged man's noose is a 20-foot length of rope that moves on its own like an animated object to entangle opponents of any size. An entangled creature is grappled and restrained. If it is not already adjacent to the hanged man, the rope initiates a Strength contest against the entangled creature on each of the hanged man's turns. If the rope wins the contest, it pulls the entangled creature 10 feet closer to the hanged man. If the entangled creature wins the Str contest, it stays at its current range from the hanged man. Only one creature can be entangled at a time. The rope can be attacked directly (AC 13); it is destroyed by 15 points of slashing or fire damage but is immune to all other damage. If the rope is severed, both it and the hanged man are destroyed. The rope becomes nothing more than 20 feet of rotted rope if removed from the hanged man.

## Actions

Claw: Melee Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d6+2`) slashing damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any land

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
A hanged man is the corpse of a hanged humanoid who was too evil to rest peacefully in the grave or who was wrongfully hanged for a crime that was actually committed by one of his or her executioners. It is a malevolent and vengeful entity that attacks living creatures on sight; it can’t be reasoned with or placated. Like a ghoul, it devours the flesh of its victims, although it seems to draw no sustenance from them.

Hanged men are always encountered near the area where they were executed or where they were interred in a way that shames them (in unsanctified ground or in a mass grave for criminals, for example). Its “lair” is either this final resting place, if it is an accessible mausoleum, or a secluded area near the place of its death that is overgrown and choked with brush, thorns, and ancient trees. Its lair is marked by the scattered remains of its victims, including any treasure a former meal happened to be carrying.

The rope around the hanged man’s neck is imbued with necrotic energy to such an extent that it acts like an extension of the undead creature. It is also the creature’s weakness, however, because if the rope is cut, the creature is also destroyed.
