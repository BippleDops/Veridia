# Iron Bands of Bilarro
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/iron-bands-of-bilarro.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action to throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.

Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb|Proficiency Bonus]]. On a hit, the target has the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition until you take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] to issue a command that releases it. Doing so or missing with the attack causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.

A creature that can touch the bands, including the one [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Restrained|Restrained]], can take an action to make a DC 20 Strength ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check to break the iron bands. On a successful check, the item is destroyed, and the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] creature is freed. On a failed check, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.

Once the bands are used, they can't be used again until the next dawn.
