# # Double-Bladed Scimitar

## Overview
**Type**: [[3 - Weapons|Martial Melee Weapons]]

**Era**: Medieval Item

**Price**: 25 gp

**Damage**: 2d4 slashing - special, two-handed

**Weight**: 6 lb.

**Properties**: If you attack with a double-bladed scimitar as part of the [[Attack]] action on your turn, you can use a bonus action immediately after to make a melee attack with it. This attack deals 1d4 slashing damage on a hit, instead of 2d4.

**Two-Handed**. This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
