# Long Rest
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 370. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A Long Rest is a period of extended downtimeâ€”at least 8 hoursâ€”available to any creature. During a Long Rest, you sleep for at least 6 hours and perform no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch.

During sleep, you have the [[conditions#Unconscious|Unconscious]] condition. After you finish a Long Rest, you must wait at least 16 hours before starting another one.

## Benefits of the Rest

To start a Long Rest, you must have at least 1 [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Point]]. When you finish the rest, you gain the following benefits:

- **Regain All HP.** You regain all lost [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] and all spent [[hit-point-dice-xphb|Hit Point Dice]]. If your Hit Point maximum was reduced, it returns to normal.  
- **Ability Scores Restored.** If any of your ability scores were reduced, they return to normal.  
- **Exhaustion Reduced.** If you have the [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] condition, its level decreases by 1.  
- **Special Feature.** Some features are recharged by a Long Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges in the way specified in its description.  

## Interrupting the Rest

A Long Rest is stopped by the following interruptions:

- Rolling [[initiative-xphb|Initiative]]  
- Casting a spell other than a cantrip  
- Taking any damage  
- 1 hour of walking or other physical exertion.  

If you rested at least 1 hour before the interruption you gain the benefits of a [[short-rest-xphb|Short Rest]].

You can resume a Long Rest immediately after an interruption. If you do so, the rest requires 1 additional hour per interruption to finish.
