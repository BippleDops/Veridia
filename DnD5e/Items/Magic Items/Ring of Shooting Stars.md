## Description

While wearing this ring in [[9 - The Environment|dim light]] or [[9 - The Environment|darkness]], you can cast **[[Dancing Lights|dancing lights]]** and **[[Light|light]]** from the ring at will. Casting either spell from the ring requires an action.

The ring has 6 charges for the following other properties. The ring regains `dice: 1d6` (1d6) expended charges daily at dawn.

***Faerie Fire.*** You can expend 1 charge as an action to cast **[[Faerie Fire|faerie fire]]** from the ring.

***Ball Lightning.*** You can expend 2 charges as an action to create one to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of [[17 - Damage and Healing|lightning]]. The more spheres you create, the less powerful each [[2 - Casting a Spell|sphere]] is individually.

Each [[2 - Casting a Spell|sphere]] appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of you. The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds [[9 - The Environment|dim light]] in a 30-foot radius.

As a [[12 - The Order of Combat|bonus action]], you can move each [[2 - Casting a Spell|sphere]] up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15 [[Dexterity|Dexterity]] saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes [[17 - Damage and Healing|lightning]] damage based on the number of spheres you created.

| **Spheres** | **Lightning Damage** |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| 4           | `dice: 2d4` (2d4)    |
| 3           | `dice: 2d6` (2d6)    |
| 2           | `dice:5d4` (5d4)     |
| 1           | `dice: 4d12` (4d12)  |

***Shooting Stars.*** You can expend 1 to 3 charges as an action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of [[9 - The Environment|light]] from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature within a 15-foot [[2 - Casting a Spell|cube]] originating from that point is showered in sparks and must make a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15 [[Dexterity|Dexterity]] saving throw, taking `dice: 5d4` (5d4) [[17 - Damage and Healing|fire]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
