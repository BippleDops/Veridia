*6th-level, Transmutation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes Until the spell ends, ice rimes your body, and you gain the following benefits: - You are immune to cold damage and have resistance to fire damage. - You can move across difficult terrain created by ice or snow without spending extra movement. - The ground in a 10-foot radius around you is icy and is difficult terrain for creatures other than you. The radius moves with you. - You can use your action to create a 15-foot cone of freezing wind extending from your outstretched hand in a direction you choose. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes``dice: 4d6``cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature that fails its save against this effect has its speed halved until the start of your next turn. **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes *Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 159* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Investiture of ice xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
