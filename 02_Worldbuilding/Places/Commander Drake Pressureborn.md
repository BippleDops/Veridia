One of the Seven Shards is hidden within the fortress's deepest vaults, its power used to enhance the pressure-based weapons systems. Commander Pressureborn knows of its existence but not its true significance in the broader cosmic struggle.

### The Deep Alliance
The fortress maintains secret communication with an underwater civilization thought to be extinct, providing mutual intelligence and support. This alliance is known only to the highest levels of command and could be controversial if revealed.

### The Temporal Arsenal
Some of the weapons in the fortress's arsenal are actually from the future, having appeared through temporal anomalies in the ocean currents. These advanced devices give the fortress capabilities that shouldn't exist yet.

### The Failsafe Protocol
Hidden throughout the fortress are systems designed to completely destroy the installation if it were ever to fall into enemy hands. Only Commander Pressureborn knows the full extent of these systems and how to activate them.
