# The Deep Uprising

*"From the crushing depths came voices that would not be silenced."*

## Overview
The Deep Uprising was a revolutionary movement led by the deepest-dwelling inhabitants of Aquabyssos who felt marginalized by the surface-oriented politics of the upper city. These deep dwellers, adapted to extreme pressure and darkness, demanded greater representation and challenged the depth-based social hierarchy that had dominated underwater society.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
- Deep-depth dwelling populations with grievances
- Charismatic leadership from deep community
- Pressure-adapted communication networks
- Resources for sustained resistance movement

### Effects
- **Political Reform**: Changes to representation systems
- **Social Revolution**: Challenges to depth-based hierarchies
- **Infrastructure Development**: Improved deep-level facilities
- **Ongoing Tensions**: Lasting political divisions

### Duration
Active uprising lasted two years, with political ramifications continuing to present day.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Uprising Veterans**: Characters encounter former revolutionaries
2. **Unfinished Business**: Remaining uprising goals create new conflicts
3. **Counter-Revolution**: Surface loyalists attempt to reverse reforms

## Campaign Use
Provides political complexity and opportunities for characters to engage with social justice themes in underwater society.

## Player-Facing Summary

The Deep Uprising is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of The Deep Uprising as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Deep Uprising.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
