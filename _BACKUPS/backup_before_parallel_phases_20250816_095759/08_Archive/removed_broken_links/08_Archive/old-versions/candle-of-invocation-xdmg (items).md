--- # Candle of Invocation

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/candle-of-invocation.webp#right) This candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires a [[actions#Magic|Magic action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from its total burn time. While lit, the candle sheds [Light Xphb]] in a 30-foot radius. While you are within that light, you have [[Advantage Xphb on [d20-test-xphb (variant-rules)]]. In addition, a Cleric or Druid in the light can cast level 1 spells they have prepared without expending spell slots. Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast [[gate-xphb (spells)]] with it. Doing so destroys the candle. The portal created by the spell links to a particular Outer Plane chosen by the DM or determined by rolling on the following table.`dice: [](candle-of-invocation-xdmg.md#^1-outer-plane)`| dice: `dice: 1d100` | Outer Plane |
