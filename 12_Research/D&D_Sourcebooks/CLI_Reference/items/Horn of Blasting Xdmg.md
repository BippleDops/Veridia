# Horn of Blasting
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/horn-of-blasting.webp#right)


You can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action to blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb|Cone]] that is audible out to 600 feet. Each creature in the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb|Cone]] makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `5d8` Thunder damage and has the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Deafened|Deafened]] condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. Glass or crystal objects in the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb|Cone]] that aren't being worn or carried take `10d8` Thunder damage.

Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals `10d6` Force damage to the user and destroys the horn.
