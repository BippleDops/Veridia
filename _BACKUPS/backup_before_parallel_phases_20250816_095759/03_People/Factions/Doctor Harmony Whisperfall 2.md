## Lore Details

Legends speak of Doctor Harmony Whisperfall as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Doctor Harmony Whisperfall.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Doctor Harmony Whisperfall to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
