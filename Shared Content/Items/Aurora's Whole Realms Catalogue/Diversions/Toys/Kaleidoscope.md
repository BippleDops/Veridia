## Description
Imported from Calimshan, these brass tubes look like a spyglass, but they allow sight into a totally new worldâ€”colored bits of glass and gems spin and are mirrored in the tube, so that the viewer sees rainbow snowflakes through the tube. Exciting, and non-magically safe, it a wonderful toy for children of all ages! A special value at 50 gp!
