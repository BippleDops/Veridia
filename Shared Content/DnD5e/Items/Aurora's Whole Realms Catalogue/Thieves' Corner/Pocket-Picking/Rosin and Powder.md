## Description
For thieves whose pocket-picking fingers do not seem sticky enough, rosin applied to the tips can boost sticking power. Those who have trouble slipping their hands into and out of purses and pockets might use our thieving powder to facilitate movement. Using rosin on the fingertips and powder on the edges produces a particularly useful combination.

Rosin cube—100 applications: (1 sp); Powder vial— 15 applications: (5 cp).
