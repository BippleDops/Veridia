# Banish Dazzle (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *1st-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a shard of glass or any clear stone)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You or one willing creature you touch becomes immune to being blinded by light, can see through nonmagical mirages and optical illusions, and has advantage on sav-ing throws against spells that create visual illusions or cause blindness through light, color, or flame, such as *blinding smite, color spray,* or *holy aura.* This also keeps creatures with the Sunlight Sensitivity trait from tak-ing disadvantage on attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. It does *not* protect creatures with Sunlight Hyper-sensitivity, however.
