# Caul Cuckoo
## Overview
### Caul Cuckoo
![[gw5g23va.lbt.png|Caul Cuckoo|300]]
[[gw5g23va.lbt.png|open outside]]

*This is no ordinary human child, but an infection, something that leeched upon a living babe whilst in the womb and smothered it, becoming something partly human and partly from Between. Its form is fluid, oily almost, and the disturbing mixture of human and slug is revolting to behold.*

## Special Traits
**Change Shape:** A caul cuckoo has two forms. Its natural form is that of a sluglike thing with a distorted humanoid head, but it can also take a humanoid form based on its mother. A caul cuckoo can shift between its forms as a bonus action. Equipment worn or carried on its humanoid form melds into its natural form.

**Distorted:** The caul cuckoo’s internal anatomy is radically different from a normal humanoid’s. Critical hits against the creature do a flat +1 damage but don’t roll damage dice twice.

**Horrific Appearance:** Creatures that start their turn within 30 feet of a caul cuckoo in its natural form and who can see it see must make a successful DC 15 Wis saving throw or be poisoned. This is a psychological effect, not actual poison, so immunity to poison offers no protection. A poisoned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn to end the effect. A successful saving throw makes the creature immune to the horrific appearance of caul cuckoos for 24 hours.

**Salt Vulnerability:** A handful of salt burns a caul cuckoo as though it was alchemist’s fire, doing `dice: 1d4` fire damage at the start of the caul cuckoo’s turn until it’s extinguished by spending an action to make a successful DC 10 Dex check.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The caul cuckoo makes three tongue attacks or sings its lullaby.

**Melee Attack—Tongue:** +5 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d4 + 3` piercing damage plus `dice: 1d6` acid damage.

**Area Attack—Lullaby:** When a caul cuckoo wails its lullaby, it has the same effect as a confusion spell that affects all creatures within 300 feet of the caul cuckoo who can hear the song. All potential targets must make successful DC 15 Wis saving throws or become confused. The confusion lasts for 1 minute or until the caul cuckoo stops singing or loses concentration on its lullaby.

## Description
**Environment**: Any land (Between)

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, gang (3–8), or cult (9–20)

Caul cuckoos are the tragic result of an unborn child corrupted by a [[Caul Cuckoo Syre|caul cuckoo syre]] while still in its mother’s womb. When birthed by its human parent, a caul cuckoo is Tiny, but otherwise has all of its normal abilities. A caul cuckoo has a 50% chance of being in either of its two forms at birth. If in its human form, it usually waits until after nightfall to either escape into the night or murder its sleeping parents and then escape. If born in its sluglike form, it immediately attacks its mother and any others present in an attempt to escape.

Though the birth of these creatures is a rare occurrence, there is a reason that many old midwives carry a bag of salt with them whenever they attend a new delivery.
