## Special Traits
***Charge.*** If the goat moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 2 (`dice: 1d4`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Sure-Footed.*** The goat has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone.

## Actions
***Ram.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (`dice: 1d4+1`) bludgeoning damage.
