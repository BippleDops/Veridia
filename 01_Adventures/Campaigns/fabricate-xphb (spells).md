--- # Fabricate

*4th-level, Transmutation* - **Casting time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp, or clothes from flax or wool. Choose raw materials that you can see within range. You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot [[Cube Area of Effect Xphb]] or eight connected 5-foot Cubes) given a sufficient quantity of material. If you're working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a 5-foot [[Cube Area of Effect Xphb]]). The quality of any fabricated objects is based on the quality of the raw materials. Creatures and magic items can't be created by this spell. You also can't use it to create items that require a high degree of skillâ€”such as weapons and armorâ€”unless you have proficiency with the type of [[artisans-tools-xphb (items)]] used to craft such objects. **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 271.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of fabricate xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around fabricate xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A merchant needs help stealing before dawn
