## Summary
Practical, table-ready rules for Pressure Combat Modifiers across Aquabyssos and Aethermoor.

## Player-Facing Summary

Pressure Combat Modifiers is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
