**Charge Attack.** If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line toward a target immediately before hitting it with a melee attack roll as part of the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Attack|Attack]] action, choose one of the following effects: gain a `d8` bonus to the attack's damage roll, or push the target up to 10 feet away if it is no more than one size larger than you.
