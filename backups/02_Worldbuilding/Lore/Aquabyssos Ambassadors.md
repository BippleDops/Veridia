# Aquabyssos Ambassadors
*Bridges Between Two Worlds*

## Overview

The Aquabyssos Ambassadors represent one of the most challenging diplomatic corps in either realm, tasked with maintaining relations between the underwater civilization of [[Aquabyssos]] and the surface world of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]. These skilled diplomats must navigate not only political complexities but also the literal challenges of operating in two drastically different environments.

Led by the experienced [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Korvin Blacktide|02 Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Korvin Blacktide]], the Ambassador Corps serves as the primary interface between [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Parliament of Echoes|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Parliament Of Echoes]] and surface governments. Their work ranges from negotiating trade agreements to preventing wars, all while managing the deep cultural misunderstandings that arise between civilizations separated by [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Drowning|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Drowning]].
