# Silver Dragon

## Lair actions
_Source: Monster Manual_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the dragon takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- The dragon creates fog as if it had cast the [[fog-cloud-xphb|fog cloud]] spell. The fog lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- A blisteringly cold wind blows through the lair near the dragon. Each creature within 120 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (`d10`) cold damage. Gases and vapors are dispersed by the wind, and unprotected flames are extinguished. Protected flames, such as lanterns, have a 50 percent chance of being extinguished.  

### Additional Lair Action

At your discretion, a legendary ([[adult-silver-dragon-xmm|adult]] or [[ancient-silver-dragon-xmm|ancient]]) silver dragon can use the following additional lair action while in its lair:

- **Icy Grip.** A sudden, supernatural chill fills the lair near the dragon. Each creature of the dragon's choice that it can see within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be [[conditions#Restrained|restrained]] until initiative count 20 on the next round. Creatures that have resistance to cold damage have advantage on the saving throw; creatures that have immunity to cold damage succeed automatically.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual_

The region containing a legendary silver dragon's lair is warped by the dragon's magic, which creates one or more of the following effects.

- Once per day, the dragon can alter the weather in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The dragon doesn't need to be outdoors; otherwise the effect is identical to the [[control-weather-xphb|control weather]] spell.  
- Within 1 mile of the lair, winds buoy non-evil creatures that fall due to no act of the dragon's or its allies. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.  
- Given days or longer to work, the dragon can make clouds and fog within its lair as solid as stone, forming structures and other objects as it wishes.  

If the dragon dies, changed weather reverts to normal, as described in the spell, and the other effects fade in `d10` days.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
