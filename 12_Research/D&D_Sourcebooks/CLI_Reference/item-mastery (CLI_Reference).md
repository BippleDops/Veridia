_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 214. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)_ If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit, the second creature takes the weapon's damage, but don't add your ability modifier to that damage unless that modifier is negative. You can make this extra attack only once per turn. ## Graze If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can be increased only by increasing the ability modifier. ## Nick When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can make it as part of the [[actions#Attack|Attack]] action instead of as a [[Action Xphb]]. You can make this extra attack only once per turn. ## Push If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from yourself if it is Large or smaller. ## Sap If you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature has [[Advantage Xphb]] on its next attack roll before the start of your next turn. ## Slow If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to it, you can reduce its [[Fly Speed Xphb]] by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit more than once by weapons that have this property, the [[Fly Speed Xphb]] reduction doesn't exceed 10 feet. ## Topple If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your [[Proficiency Xphb]]). On a failed save, the creature has the [[conditions#prone|Prone]] condition. ## Vex If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you have [[Advantage Xphb]] on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn. ## Player-Facing Summary Item mastery is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of item mastery as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around item mastery. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Covenant - Control trade routes ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
