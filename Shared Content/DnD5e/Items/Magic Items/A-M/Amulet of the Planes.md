## Description
While wearing this [[Amulet|amulet]], you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15 [[Intelligence|Intelligence]] check. On a successful check, you cast the **[[Plane Shift|plane shift]]** spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a `dice: d100` (d100). On a 1–60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61–100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence.
