# Arcanum Heights
*The Floating Towers of Magical Learning*

## Overview

Suspended high above [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven]] on crystally-powered levitation platforms, Arcanum Heights represents the pinnacle of magical achievement in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor. This district of floating towers, aerial bridges, and gravity-defying gardens serves as the premier magical research and education center for the surface world, rivaling even the infamous [02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Abyssal Academy]] in the depths of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos.

The Heights house the most advanced magical practitioners, dangerous experimental facilities, and the largest collection of pre-[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Drowning|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Drowning]] magical knowledge remaining on the surface. Here, crystal-powered enchantments push the boundaries of what many consider possible, creating both wonders and catastrophes in equal measure.

## Architecture & Layout

### The Floating Towers
Seven major towers hover at different altitudes above Crystalhaven, each dedicated to a school of magical study:

**The Evocation Spire** - Highest tower, dealing with dangerous energy magic
**The Transmutation Cylinder** - Constantly shifting shape and materials
**The Enchantment Dome** - Spherical structure with mind-affecting protections
**The Conjuration Platform** - Open-air facility for summoning research
**The Divination Needle** - Impossibly thin tower reaching toward the stars
**The Necromancy Vault** - Heavily shielded underground facility (technically part of Heights district)
**The Abjuration Fortress** - Central defensive structure protecting all others

### Connecting Infrastructure
**Crystal Bridges**: Solid light constructs linking towers, requiring magical authorization to cross
**Levitation Platforms**: Public transportation between towers and ground level
