    "description": "Marina commands attention the moment she enters a room. Her deep red hair flows past her shoulders with an almost liquid quality, seeming to move even in still air. Her sea-green eyes shift between jade and turquoise depending on her mood and the light. What most take for elaborate nautical tattoos covering her arms and neck are actually ancestral depth-marks that glow faintly when she's near large bodies of water or shard energy.\n\nShe dresses in practical sailing clothes mixed with finery stolen from a dozen ports - leather boots worth a fortune, a coat from a naval officer, rings from various \"negotiations.\" Her voice carries the musical lilt of the Meridian docks mixed with phrases from a dozen languages. She moves with a dancer's grace and a predator's awareness.",
