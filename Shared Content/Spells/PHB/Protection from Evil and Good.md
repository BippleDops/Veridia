# Protection from Evil and Good
Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be [[charmed]], [[frightened]], or possessed by them. If the target is already [[charmed]], [[frightened]], or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
