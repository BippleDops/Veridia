*This population analysis reveals significant imbalances requiring immediate attention. The current distribution is economically unsustainable without major adjustments to agricultural capacity and resource allocation.*

**Critical Actions Required**:
1. Correct impossible population figures
2. Expand agricultural workforce by 30%
3. Redistribute Abyssos Prime overflow population
4. Establish missing support infrastructure
