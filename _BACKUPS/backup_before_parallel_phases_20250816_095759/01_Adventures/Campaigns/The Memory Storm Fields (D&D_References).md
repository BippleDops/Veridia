The Memory Storm Fields represent one of Aquabyssos's most mysterious and dangerous phenomena: vast regions where accumulated memories from millions of beings crystallize into reality-warping weather patterns. These temporal storms manifest as swirling maelstroms of liquid memory that can trap travelers in recursive loops of past events, force them to experience lifetimes of foreign memories, or completely rewrite their personal history. Unlike normal weather, Memory Storms respond to consciousness itselfâ€”becoming more intense and dangerous when they encounter minds full of strong memories or emotional trauma. ### Memory Storm Effects Table
