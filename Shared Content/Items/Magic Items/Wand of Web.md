## Description
This [[Wand|wand]] has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast the **[[Web|web]]** spell (save [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15) from it.

The [[Wand|wand]] regains `dice: 1d6+1` (1d6+1) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wandâ€™s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
