--- # Boots of Speed

*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/boots-of-speed.webp#right) While you wear these boots, you can take a [[Action Xphb to click the boots' heels together. If you do, the boots double your [Fly Speed Xphb]], and any creature that makes an [[actions#Opportunity%20Attack|Opportunity Attack against you has [Advantage Xphb]] on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect. When you've used the boots' property for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function for you until you finish a [[long-rest-xphb]]. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 240.
