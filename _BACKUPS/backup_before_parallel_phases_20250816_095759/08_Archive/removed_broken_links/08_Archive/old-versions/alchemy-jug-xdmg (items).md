--- # Alchemy Jug

*Wondrous item, uncommon* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/alchemy-jug.webp#right) - **Weight**: 12.0 lbs. This ceramic jug appears to be able to hold a gallon of liquid and weighs 12 pounds whether full or empty. The jug sloshes when it is shaken, even if the jug is empty. You can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic action and name one liquid from the Alchemy Jug Liquids table to cause the jug to produce the chosen liquid. Afterward, you can uncork the jug as a [actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action and pour that liquid out, up to 2 gallons per minute. The maximum amount of liquid the jug can produce depends on the liquid you named. Once the jug starts producing a liquid, it can't produce a different one, or more of one that has reached its maximum, until the next dawn. **Alchemy Jug Liquids** | Liquid | Max. Amount |
|--------|-------------|
| Acid | 8 ounces |
| Basic Poison | 4 ounces |
| Beer | 4 gallons |
| Honey | 1 gallon |
| Mayonnaise | 2 gallons |
| Oil | 1 quart |
| Vinegar | 2 gallons |
| Water, fresh | 8 gallons |
| Water, salt | 12 gallons |
| Wine | 1 gallon |
