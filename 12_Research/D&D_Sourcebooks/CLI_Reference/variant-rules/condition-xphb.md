# Condition
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 363. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A condition is a temporary game state. The definition of a condition says how it affects its recipient, and various rules define how to end a condition. This glossary defines these conditions:

- [[conditions#Blinded|Blinded]]  
- [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]]  
- [[conditions#Deafened|Deafened]]  
- [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]]  
- [[conditions#Frightened|Frightened]]  
- [[conditions#Grappled|Grappled]]  
- [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]]  
- [[conditions#Invisible|Invisible]]  
- [[conditions#Paralyzed|Paralyzed]]  
- [[conditions#Petrified|Petrified]]  
- [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]]  
- [[conditions#Prone|Prone]]  
- [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]]  
- [[conditions#Stunned|Stunned]]  
- [[conditions#Unconscious|Unconscious]]  

A condition doesn't stack with itself; a recipient either has a condition or doesn't. The [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] condition is an exception to that rule.
