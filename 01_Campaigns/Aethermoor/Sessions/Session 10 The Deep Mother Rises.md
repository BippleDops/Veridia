# Session 10: The Deep Mother Rises

> *The merged city shudders as massive tentacles of pure void rise from the depths.*

## üé¨ Strong Start

The merged city shudders as massive tentacles of pure void rise from the depths. The Deep Mother, an entity older than both civilizations, begins to surface. Ships from the Eastern Kingdoms arrive just as reality tears open beneath them. The party must coordinate both worlds' defenses while the bloodline carrier's transformation reaches its conclusion. The crown burns with terrible purpose.

## üé≠ Campaign Conclusion Options

### Victory Through Unity
If the party successfully unites both worlds and communes with the Deep Mother, she agrees to slumber peacefully, her loneliness eased by the dream of merged civilizations. The bloodline carrier becomes the eternal bridge between realms, transformed but retaining their consciousness. New Meridian becomes a beacon of cooperation, with floating districts of [[Aquabyssos]] creating a vertical city of wonder. The Eastern Kingdoms establish embassies, and a new age of magical renaissance begins.

### Pyrrhic Victory
If the party must seal the Deep Mother by force, the effort requires the bloodline carrier to fully merge with the crown, becoming a living monument at the city's heart. Both worlds survive but scarred. Some districts remain permanently merged while others separate. The Eastern Kingdoms establish a cautious trade relationship. Citizens learn to live with duality, and the party becomes the new council governing the changed world.

### Bittersweet Ending
If the party makes a compact with the Deep Mother, she withdraws but takes [[Aquabyssos]] with her to explore the cosmic void. The underwater city phases out of reality, leaving only a few districts as embassies. The bloodline carrier can choose mortality or immortality. Meridian is forever changed, with patches of impossible architecture and physics. The party must help establish new norms for a reality that's been fundamentally altered.

- Mythic boons from the Deep Mother
