# Clay No-Face's Charm
**Type**: Supernatural Gifts
**Group**: Charm

## Overview: 
While you have Clay No-Face in your possession, you don't need to eat, drink, or breathe. These benefits last for 30 days while the doll is in your possession, after which the charm vanishes from you.

The doll is a Tiny construct. Destroying the doll causes the child's soul within it to become trapped in The Soulmonger.
