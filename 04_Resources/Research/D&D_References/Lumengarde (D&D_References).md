Lumengarde is a breathtaking city grown rather than built, formed from cultivated bioluminescent coral, kelp, and engineered organisms. Located in the Gloom Gardens at 1,200 feet depth, the city pulses with natural light in patterns that serve as both illumination and communication. The [[Coral Courts maintain their primary seat of power here, and the city is renowned for its biological magic and living architecture. ### The Radiant Core

The heart of Lumengarde, where the massive Mothercoral provides the template for all city growth. [Duke Cyrus Reefheart|02 Worldbuilding/People/Duke Cyrus Reefheart]] holds court in the Coral Palace, a living structure that grows new rooms as needed. ### The Cultivation Terraces

Stepped growing fields where specialized farmers tend to bioluminescent crops and architectural organisms. Furthermore, [[Master Cultivator Thalia Greenglow oversees production and experimentation. ### The Symbiont Quarter

Residential area where inhabitants live in perfect symbiosis with their coral homes. [Whisper-Witch Naia Softcurrent]] helps newcomers bond with living structures. ### The Enzyme Markets

Commercial district where biological products are traded. [[The Phosphor Markets|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Phosphor Markets maintain a permanent outpost here, managed by [Merchant Delilah Currentrunner]]'s cousin. ### The Deep Garden

A darker section where dangerous but useful organisms are cultivated. [[Doctor Silas Voidtouch conducts controversial adaptation experiments here. ### The Singing Reef

A massive coral formation that resonates with tidal movements, creating hauntingly beautiful music. [Siren Maeve Echoborn]] performs here, weaving magic into the natural harmonies. ### The Growth Cathedral

Temple dedicated to the living nature of the sea, where [[High Cultivist Jasper Lifebinder preaches the gospel of biological adaptation over mechanical preservation. ### The Spawn Pools

Nurseries where the city's living buildings begin their growth. Heavily guarded due to sabotage attempts by those opposing biological adaptation. ### The Luminous Library

A collection of knowledge stored in modified jellyfish that project information when touched. [Archivist Vera Glowmind]] maintains this unique repository. ### The Adaptation Chambers

Medical facility where citizens undergo voluntary (and sometimes involuntary) biological modifications. Connected to the [[Abyssal Academy's research. ### The Biolume Bazaar

Weekly market where rare organisms and biological materials are traded. Known for illegal sales of prohibited adaptations. ### Coral Shaper's Studio

[Artisan Felix Reefwright]] sculpts living coral into tools, weapons, and art. Each piece continues growing after purchase. ### The Glowing Goblet

Tavern run by [[Barkeep Mira Algaebrew, serves bioluminescent drinks that provide temporary enhancements. Popular with the [Free Current]]. ### Symbiont Solutions

[[Healer Sage Bondseer helps resolve conflicts between inhabitants and their living homes, also treats adaptation rejection. ## Current Events

1. The Mothercoral showing signs of mysterious illness
2. Radical adaptation cult [The Biomancers]] gaining followers
3. Trade dispute with [[Pressure's End|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Pressure's End over organism trafficking

> - Duke Reefheart is slowly merging with his palace
> - The Deep Garden contains experiments in creating Deepmind-resistant organisms
> - Several prominent citizens are actually colony organisms mimicking individuals
> - The city's growth pattern is spelling out an eldritch summoning circle ## Random Encounters (d10)

1. Escaped experimental organism causing panic
2. Street performer with trained luminous creatures
3. Coral structure suddenly growing across pathway
4. Merchant selling "pre-drowning" seeds
5. Adaptation rejection victim seeking help
6. Reef Guard investigating organism smuggling

10. Building having an allergic reaction to occupant ## Player-Facing Summary Lumengarde is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Lumengarde as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Lumengarde. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is protecting an heir for love
