# Shout (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (30-foot cone)

**Components**: V, M (a drop of honey, a drop of citric acid, and a small cone made from horn)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You shout, releasing an ear-splitting noise. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 5d10 thunder damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one, and is deafened for 10 minutes. A creature made of inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this saving throw.

All objects and structures take double damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level about 4th.
