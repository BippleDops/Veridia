# Pact of the Chain
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 157. Available in the SRD*  

You learn the [[find-familiar-xphb|Find Familiar]] spell and can cast it as a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action without expending a spell slot.

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: [[imp-xmm|Imp]], [[pseudodragon-xmm|Pseudodragon]], [[quasit-xmm|Quasit]], [[skeleton-xmm|Skeleton]], [[slaad-tadpole-xmm|Slaad Tadpole]], [[sphinx-of-wonder-xmm|Sphinx of Wonder]], [[sprite-xmm|Sprite]], or [[venomous-snake-xmm|Venomous Snake]] (see appendix B for the familiar's stat block).

Additionally, when you take the [[actions#Attack|Attack]] action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its [[reaction-xphb|Reaction]].
