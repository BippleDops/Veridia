# Charm of Snowball Strike
**Type**: Supernatural Gifts
**Group**: Charm

## Overview: 
This charm has 5 charges. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of the charm's charges to create a magical snowball in your hand and throw it. You must have a hand free to hold the snowball, or the charge is wasted. The snowball is a magic ranged weapon with which you are proficient. It has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet, it deals `dice: 1d4` cold damage on a hit, and it scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. If you score a critical hit with the snowball, the target is [[blinded]] until the end of its next turn. The snowball vanishes immediately after you hit or miss with it, or at the end of your turn if you don't throw it. Once all its charges have been expended, this charm vanishes from you.
