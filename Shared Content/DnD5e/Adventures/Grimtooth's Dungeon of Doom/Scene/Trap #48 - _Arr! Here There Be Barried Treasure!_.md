# Trap #48 - "Arr! Here There Be Barried Treasure!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The bronze door the tomb traipsers saw from the top is revealed to be another of those masterpieces of bronze casting that have been appearing throughout the tomb complex. It depicts the stumpy figure of Evinrood standing in the prow of a sailing ship. Around him in the air and the water are depicted the usual distorted humanlike figures of the elementals he commands. In the distance is a ship which appears to be fleeing him. 
> 
> There is a wheel in the center of the door, which must be turned before it will open.
> 
> I am fond of pointing out that there is usually some trepidation on the part of the party when forced to do things they know from past experience can be fatal. This reaction should be acute in this case, as there has been no previous time when turning one of these wheels has not at least resulted in extreme discomfort. Rest assured they will eventually turn it, curiosity, cats and delvers all having a fatal relationship.
> 
> When the wheel is turned it will do so slowly, regardless of the strength of the individual who is turning it. It will give out with a painful sounding squeal, as if some part of the mechanism is badly corroded. And then ...
> 
> The door will open, with no apparent ill effects! Suprised? Don't be, the trap has already been set in motion!
> 
> What the party sees is a room full of pristine white sand. It is loose, almost powdery, but firm enough to walk on with little effort. In the center of the wall opposite the door on the surface of the sand is a large "X". This curious mark is laid out in a meticulous fashion with a fine black sand. The implications are obvious, perhaps too obvious!
> 
> The desired reaction is that the delvers dig at this point. If they do so they will find, at a point six feet down a chest. In the chest is a substantial amount of gold coinage, and a map! (The inscriptions on the map are indistinct, more will be revealed about the map later! See page 67.) The gold will total up to 5,000 g.p.
> 
> If the party wishes prudently to ignore the obvious invitation of the black "X". They will be able to indulge themselves in searching the room for other exits. In the upper most comer on the same wall as [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] door can be found, covered with stucco as usual, a circular opening 3 feet in diameter! There is no other exit.
> 
> In the event that the party digs, or searches, the time taken will be roughly the same. (If this seems unlikely, in the words of a famous leader of another era, "Make It So!" On this trap timing is everything.)
> 
> When the door was opened to enter the room, it also opened, deep beneath the sand, a series of gratings, which allowed water from the underground river to begin to seep into the bottom of the room. This water is under some pressure, taken as it is from up stream, and is trying to reach its own level. Due to this pressure, perhaps seep is the wrong word, at any rate the fine sand is rapidly becoming saturated from the bottom up. Lest the diggers be disturbed immediately the room extends 30 feet down, below the sand's surface.
> 
> While this may seem like a digression, a brief discussion of the dynamics of sand in river beds is very relevant at this point. In what is a normally dry sandy river bottom a very strange reaction can sometimes occur, when water is added due to flooding up stream. While the river may not begin to actually flow, the water will return to the river bed, underground. This will saturate the sand and at a certain point the sand will suddenly go from being a supportive solid to a nonsupportive semi-liquid! Quicksand.
> 
> Back to the room. The water has been percolating into the sand for some time now. If the party is searching the walls for alternate solutions to what seems to be their stymied travels they will find one. The sand at their feet Bloop! It will happen very fast. Those in heavy armor will have the least reaction time, while those who are unarmored can even manage to float for a time. Armored characters will have a base 50% chance (L4) to react; this will be lowered by 10% for each 20lbs. over I 00 in weight the delver is carrying. All other tomb robbers will have a 70% chance (L3) chance to react. This will be modified down by 10% for every 20lbs. over 80 the delver is carrying. The reason for the suddenness of this event is that when the sand reaches total saturation it in effect "turns over" under the heavier surface features, having lost in that instant its load bearing capacity.
> 
> Now I'll grant you that only in the cases of those delvers grossly overloaded with, say gold for instance, is this trap going to be fatal. Don't let this get you down after all there are those who will dig at the "X"!
> 
> In the case of the treasure hunters, a good thing to do will be to let them find the chest and open it. They will start stuffing various pockets with the gold, increasing their weight. Then point out the water that seems to be rising in the bottom of the hole! Frantic efforts to get out can be played out, but keep in mind the ages old axiom, "Some Quick Sand Is Quicker Than Others!" Bloop! Adjust the chances of failure up by 20% and you will have an excellent opportunity to teach a bunch of tomb robbers the delicate art of mud breathing!
> 
> If the party is in the hole when the water saturates the sand, this is a 3 skull trap. If they are 􀃁just rummaging around there are too many ways to out fox quicksand to rate it much higher than a two skuller.
