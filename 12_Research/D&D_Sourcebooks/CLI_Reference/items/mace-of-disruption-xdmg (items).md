![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/mace-of-disruption.webp#right)

- **Damage**: 1d6 bludgeoning
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

When you hit a Fiend or an Undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra `2d6` Radiant damage. If the target has 25 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature has the [[conditions#frightened|Frightened]] condition until the end of your next turn.
