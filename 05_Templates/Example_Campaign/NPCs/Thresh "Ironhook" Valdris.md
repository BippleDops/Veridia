# Thresh "Ironhook" Valdris

## General Info
**Race**: Human
**Gender**: Male
**Age**: 45
**Occupation**: Docks Operations for the Shadowhaven Smugglers Ring
**Location**: [[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/Locations/Shadowhaven]] Docks

## Description
Thresh Valdris is a big, ugly man with a hook for a hand and a mean streak a mile wide. He is responsible for the Shadowhaven Smugglers Ring's operations on the docks, and he is not afraid to use violence to get what he wants.

## GM Notes
- He is a dangerous and unpredictable individual.
- He is a rival of [[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/NPCs/Harbormaster Willem Tidecaller]].
- He is a good source of information about the goings-on on the docks, but he will only talk to those who he respects.
