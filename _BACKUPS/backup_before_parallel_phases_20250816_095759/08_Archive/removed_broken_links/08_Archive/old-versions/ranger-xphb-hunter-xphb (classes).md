Whenever you finish a [[short-rest-xphb or [long-rest-xphb]], you can replace the chosen option with the other one. #### Colossus Slayer Your tenacity can wear down even the most resilient foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon, the weapon deals an extra`d8`damage to the target if it's missing any of its [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules). You can deal this extra damage only once per turn. #### Horde Breaker Once on each of your turns when you make an attack with a weapon, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target, that is within the weapon's range, and that you haven't attacked this turn. ### Hunter's Lore (Level 3) You can call on the forces of nature to reveal certain strengths and weaknesses of your prey. While a creature is marked by your Hunter's Mark, you know whether that creature has any Immunities, Resistances, or Vulnerabilities, and if the creature has any, you know what they are. ### Defensive Tactics (Level 7) #### Escape the Horde [actions#Opportunity%20Attack|Opportunity Attacks]] have [[Advantage Xphb against you. #### Multiattack Defense When a creature hits you with an attack roll, that creature has [Advantage Xphb]] on all other attack rolls against you this turn. ### Superior Hunter's Prey (Level 11) Once per turn when you deal damage to a creature marked by your Hunter's Mark, you can also deal that spell's extra damage to a different creature that you can see within 30 feet of the first creature. ### Superior Hunter's Defense (Level 15) When you take damage, you can take a [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules) to give yourself [boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats)]] to that damage and any other damage of the same type until the end of the current turn. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Ranger xphb hunter xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
