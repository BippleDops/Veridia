## Overview
Captain Scale-Walker is a weathered lizardfolk mariner who commands respect in the deepest waters of [[Aquabyssos]]. Born in the twilight depths where light barely penetrates, he has spent decades mapping the treacherous passages between the surface waters and the abyssal plains. His ship, *The Serpent's Current*, is one of the few vessels capable of navigating the crushing pressures and strange currents that guard Aquabyssos's most valuable secrets.

### The Deepest Current
**Level**: 8-12  
Scale-Walker has finally located signs of the legendary Deepest Current - a passage that supposedly leads to the very bottom of the world ocean. He needs skilled adventurers to help him navigate the dangers and document the discovery. The journey will take them through territory controlled by ancient things that predate current civilization.

### The Refugee Crisis
**Level**: 5-9  
A group of deep-dwelling refugees needs transport to safe waters, but their passage is blocked by [[Admiral Cassandra Stormwind]]'s fleet. Scale-Walker asks the party to create a distraction or negotiate safe passage while he smuggles them through the deep routes.

### The Coral Conspiracy
**Level**: 6-10  
Scale-Walker's ship has become infected with an unknown coral that seems to be changing its behavior. The coral whispers in an ancient language and appears to be guiding the ship toward [[The Primordial Vaults]]. He needs help determining if this is a blessing or a curse.

### The Deep Alliance
**Level**: 10-15  
[[Aboleth Prime Yoth]]'s forces are moving in the deepest waters, and Scale-Walker has been chosen to carry messages between surface powers and the deep dwellers. The party must protect him during negotiations while navigating the political complexities of an alliance between species that have been enemies for millennia.

### The Lost Expedition
**Level**: 7-11  
A research expedition funded by [[Castellan Ironledger III]] has gone missing in the deep trenches. Scale-Walker was hired to find them, but the area they disappeared in is controlled by something that even he fears to approach. The party must help him mount a rescue operation.

### Speech Patterns
