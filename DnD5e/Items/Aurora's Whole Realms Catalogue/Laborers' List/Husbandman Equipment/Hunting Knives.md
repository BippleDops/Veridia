### Hunting Knives (Pic)

## Description
An old elven saying holds that “It is better to have a bad knife than a good dwarf.” Though some consider this statement an insult to dwarves, I prefer to think of it as a praise of knives. Truly the universal tool, knives are as simple and inexpensive as they are versatile. We offer a trail knife with a jag-toothed tip and a keen steel blade (1 gp) as well as an unique folding knife with two blades (4 gp). One wanderer I know used the folding knife to escape an orcish guard who did not think the device a weapon.
