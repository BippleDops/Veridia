# Carpet of Flying, 3 ft. Ã— 5 ft.
*Wondrous item, very rare*  

You can make this carpet hover and fly by taking a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action and using the carpet's command word. It moves according to your directions if you are within 30 feet of it.

A 3 ft. Ã— 5 ft. carpet can carry up to 200 lb. at a fly speed of 80 feet. A carpet can carry up to twice the weight shown on the table, but its [[fly-speed-xphb|Fly Speed]] is halved if it carries more than its normal capacity.
