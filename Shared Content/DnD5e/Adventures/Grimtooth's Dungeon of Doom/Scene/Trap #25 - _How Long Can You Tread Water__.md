# Trap #25 - "How Long Can You Tread Water?"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> What is left of the tomb robbing party will be ejected out over a vast underground lake. They will be carried by the pressure of the entire river far out from the wall. where they will plummet to the surface of the lake below. 150 feet below! Luck will play a major part in surviving a fall from this height. There is a 30% chance (L3) that death will result from Lhe fall. Drowning from the depth of the plunge is what will likely tum up on the coroner's report. (The last primarily applies to heavily armoured characters.)
> 
> will be a collection of bones. most sliced into convenient 8 inch bits. It would be here that an appearance of the legendary Glass Catfish would be very convenient. The party winded, bereft of boat, thrashing about in the water, perfect!
> 
> The legendary Glass Catfish will be found lurking at the bottoms of this grotto. This baby is a giant breed of catfish whose flesh is transparent. The Glass Cat just lies waiting for lunch to come to it. Lying on the bottom he looks like an old skeleton picked clean and left by time, unless he has just eaten. Digestion can be a gross process especially if it is someone you know! He can grow up to 40 feet in length depending upon his food supply. (Almost always found one at a time this creature is like fighting a subterranian killer whale: VERY tough.)
> 
> If you find the fish and the party are reluctant to mix it up there is always a way to bait the delvers into diving down and stirring up the fish. Liberally sprinkle the bottom with about 15,000 g.p. worth of gold and gems mixed in with the jumbled bones and I don't think you will have any problems.
> 
> Keeping in mind that the "Fish .. should be at least as tough as a 15 L Warrior (remember Gargantua) the trap only rates two skulls. With just the fish and the fall this trap is more scenic than deadly.
