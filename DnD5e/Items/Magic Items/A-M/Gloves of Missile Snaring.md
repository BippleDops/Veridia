## Description
These gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you [[2 - Armor|don]] them. When a ranged weapon [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] hits you while youâ€™re wearing them, you can use your [[12 - The Order of Combat|reaction]] to reduce the damage by `dice: 1d10` (1d10) + your [[Dexterity|Dexterity]] modifier, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.
