## Description
After a long dayâ€™s hike, nothing tastes better than a venison steak, a cup of cold wine and a slice of cheese. Unfortunately, the other forest inhabitants could not agree more. However, our leather provision bag not only holds smells in, but also allows victuals to be hung from tree branches, well out of the reach of dangerous animals. By cinching the mouth tight, casting the rope over a tree-limb and hoisting the bag, food can be stored safely away from roving animals. (3 gp)
