# Ice Storm
*4th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a mitten)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Hail falls in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]] centered on a point within range. Each creature in the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]] makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `2d10` Bludgeoning damage and `4d6` Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Hailstones turn ground in the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]] into [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb|Difficult Terrain]] until the end of your next turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The Bludgeoning damage increases by `d10` for each spell slot level above 4.
