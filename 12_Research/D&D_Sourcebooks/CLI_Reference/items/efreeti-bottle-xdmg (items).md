# Efreeti Bottle
*Wondrous item, very rare*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/efreeti-bottle.webp#right)

When you take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to remove the stopper of this painted brass bottle, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of it. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an [[Efreeti Xmm]] appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

The first time the bottle is opened, the DM rolls on the following table to determine what happens.

`dice: [](efreeti-bottle-xdmg.md#^1-effect)`

| dice: 1d10 | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| 1 | The [[Efreeti Xmm]] attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. |
| 2-9 | The [[Efreeti Xmm]] understands your languages and obeys your commands for 1 hour, after which it returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can't be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic. |
| 10 | The [[Efreeti Xmm]] understands your languages and can cast [[wish-xphb (spells)]] once for you. It disappears when it grants the wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic. |
^1-effect
