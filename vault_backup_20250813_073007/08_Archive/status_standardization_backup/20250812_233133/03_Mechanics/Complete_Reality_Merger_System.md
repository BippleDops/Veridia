## Core Concepts

### The Nature of Reality in the Dual Worlds

Since the Sundering 300 years ago, Aquabyssos and Aethermoor exist as parallel dimensions, separated by the Surface Seal. However, this separation is imperfect. Reality itself remembers when the worlds were one, and that memory creates weak points where the dimensions bleed together.

### Reality Integrity Scale

Reality's stability is measured on a scale of 0-100:

| Integrity | State | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| 91-100 | Absolute | Completely stable, no dimensional bleed |
| 76-90 | Stable | Minor fluctuations, rare anomalies |
| 51-75 | Wavering | Noticeable instabilities, merger zones possible |
| 26-50 | Unstable | Frequent mergers, reality shifts common |
| 11-25 | Cascading | Constant flux, dimensions overlapping |
| 1-10 | Collapsing | Reality breakdown imminent |
| 0 | Merged | Dimensions fully combined |

### The Convergence Principle

Reality naturally seeks reunification. Every use of cross-dimensional magic, every memory of the other world, every adapted being weakens the barrier. The Deep Mother's awakening accelerates this process exponentially.

### Merger Zone Classifications

#### Type I: Flickering
- **Duration**: Minutes to hours
- **Predictability**: Random
- **Effect**: Brief glimpses of other world
- **Danger**: Low (confusion, disorientation)

#### Type II: Oscillating
- **Duration**: Hours to days
- **Predictability**: Follows patterns
- **Effect**: Regular shifts between worlds
- **Danger**: Moderate (environmental hazards)

#### Type III: Overlapping
- **Duration**: Days to weeks
- **Predictability**: Semi-stable
- **Effect**: Both worlds exist simultaneously
- **Danger**: High (conflicting physics)

#### Type IV: Anchored
- **Duration**: Permanent unless disrupted
- **Predictability**: Stable merger
- **Effect**: New hybrid reality
- **Danger**: Extreme (fundamental changes)

#### Type V: Paradox
- **Duration**: Variable
- **Predictability**: Chaotic
- **Effect**: Impossible geometries, temporal loops
- **Danger**: Catastrophic (reality damage)

## Reality Stability Mechanics

### Measuring Stability

#### Local Stability Check
Roll 1d100 each day/session:

| Roll | Stability Change |
|------|------------------|
| 01-05 | -2d10 (major event) |
| 06-15 | -1d10 (destabilization) |
| 16-25 | -1d6 (minor flux) |
| 26-75 | No change |
| 76-85 | +1d4 (natural recovery) |
| 86-95 | +1d6 (stabilization) |
| 96-100 | +1d10 (reality anchor) |

#### Stability Modifiers

**Destabilizing Factors**:
- Cross-dimensional travel: -5 per instance
- Dimensional magic use: -1 per spell level
- Deep Mother activity: -10 per manifestation
- Memory pearl activation: -2 per use
- Adapted being presence: -1 per 10 AP
- Paradox creation: -20 instantly

**Stabilizing Factors**:
- Reality anchor active: +5 per day
- Dimensional seal ritual: +10 per casting
- Surface Seal proximity: +3 per mile
- Null zones: +10 within area
- Separation enforcement: +5 per action

### Reality Stress Points

Certain locations accumulate reality stress:

#### Stress Accumulation
| Activity | Stress Points |
|----------|---------------|
| Portal opening | 10 |
| Dimensional spell | 2 per level |
| Death of adapted | 5 |
| Prophetic vision | 3 |
| Time distortion | 7 |
| Memory alteration | 4 |

#### Stress Thresholds
| Total Stress | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| 0-25 | No effect |
| 26-50 | Minor anomalies |
| 51-75 | Merger zone forms |
| 76-100 | Reality cascade |
| 101+ | Permanent merger |

### Reality Cascades

When stability drops below 25, reality cascades begin:

**Stage 1: Initial Fractures** (Stability 25-20)
- Visual echoes of other world
- Sounds bleeding through
- Temperature fluctuations
- Gravity variations (±10%)

**Stage 2: Dimensional Overlap** (Stability 19-15)
- Objects phase between worlds
- Creatures from both worlds appear
- Navigation becomes difficult
- Magic becomes unpredictable

**Stage 3: Physics Breakdown** (Stability 14-10)
- Conflicting natural laws
- Temporal anomalies
- Consciousness bleeding
- Environmental transformation

**Stage 4: Reality Collapse** (Stability 9-5)
- Space becomes non-Euclidean
- Time flows in multiple directions
- Identity dissolution threatens
- Permanent changes likely

**Stage 5: Complete Merger** (Stability 4-0)
- Worlds fully combine
- New reality crystallizes
- Irreversible transformation
- Unknown final state

## Temporal Distortion Effects

### Time Flow Variations

In merger zones, time flows differently:

#### Time Differential Table
| Zone Type | Aquabyssos Time | Aethermoor Time | Real Time |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Stable | 1:1 | 1:1 | Normal |
| Flickering | 1:1.5 | 1:0.75 | Variable |
| Oscillating | 1:2 | 1:0.5 | Cyclical |
| Overlapping | Variable | Variable | Chaotic |
| Anchored | Synchronized | Synchronized | New rate |
| Paradox | Loops | Loops | Broken |

### Temporal Anomaly Table (d100)

| Roll | Anomaly | Duration | Effect |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| 01-05 | Time stop | 1d4 rounds | Everything frozen except PCs |
| 06-10 | Time acceleration | 1 minute | Actions at double speed |
| 11-15 | Time deceleration | 1 hour | Everything at half speed |
| 16-20 | Temporal echo | 1d6 rounds | Actions repeat previous round |
| 21-25 | Future glimpse | Instant | See 1 round ahead |
| 26-30 | Past intrusion | 1d10 minutes | Past events replay |
| 31-35 | Age flux | Permanent | Age ±1d20 years |
| 36-40 | Temporal loop | Until broken | Repeat same hour |
| 41-45 | Causality break | 1 day | Effects precede causes |
| 46-50 | Timeline split | Permanent | Create alternate timeline |
| 51-55 | Memory scramble | 1d4 hours | Past/present/future confused |
| 56-60 | Temporal phasing | 1d6 rounds | Exist in multiple moments |
| 61-65 | Chronological exile | 1d4 days | Removed from timeline |
| 66-70 | Time reversal | 1d10 rounds | Everything runs backward |
| 71-75 | Temporal storm | 1 hour | Random time effects |
| 76-80 | Destiny lock | Until fulfilled | Must complete future event |
| 81-85 | Past life bleed | Permanent | Gain memories of past self |
| 86-90 | Future self meeting | 10 minutes | Encounter future version |
| 91-95 | Temporal shatter | Instant | Exist in all times briefly |
| 96-99 | Causality weapon | Single use | Change one past event |
| 100 | Temporal ascension | Permanent | Become untethered from time |

### Managing Temporal Distortions

#### Temporal Anchoring
Characters can anchor themselves in time:

**Anchor Points**:
- Strong memories: +2 to saves
- Physical objects from home time: +3
- Emotional connections: +4
- Reality anchor device: +5
- Deep Mother's blessing: Automatic success (but at what cost?)

**Temporal Saves**:
DC = 10 + (Reality Instability / 10) + Temporal Stress

Failure results in:
- Lost time (1d4 hours missing)
- Temporal displacement (wrong time period)
- Age variation (±1d6 years)
- Memory confusion (past/future mixed)

### Paradox Resolution

When paradoxes occur (meeting yourself, changing your past, etc.):

**Paradox Severity**:
1. **Minor**: Small inconsistency (DC 10 to resolve)
2. **Moderate**: Significant change (DC 15, reality stress +10)
3. **Major**: Timeline alteration (DC 20, reality stress +20)
4. **Catastrophic**: Causality break (DC 25, reality cascade)

**Resolution Methods**:
- Accept paradox (gain madness, reality stabilizes)
- Force consistency (lose memories, timeline repairs)
- Create timeline branch (split party across timelines)
- Embrace chaos (become paradox entity)

## Consciousness Merging Rules

### The Nature of Merged Consciousness

When realities overlap, so do the minds within them. Consciousness merging ranges from brief empathic connections to complete identity fusion.

### Merger Stages

#### Stage 1: Empathic Resonance
- Feel emotions of dimensional twin
- Sense their general state
- No direct communication
- Wisdom save DC 10 to maintain separation

#### Stage 2: Thought Bleeding
- Hear surface thoughts
- Share sensory input occasionally
- Confusion about whose thoughts are whose
- Wisdom save DC 15 to maintain identity

#### Stage 3: Memory Sharing
- Access each other's memories
- Skills begin to blend
- Personality traits mix
- Wisdom save DC 20 to remain distinct

#### Stage 4: Identity Fusion
- Become single consciousness in two bodies
- Share all abilities and knowledge
- Act with perfect coordination
- Wisdom save DC 25 to separate

#### Stage 5: Complete Merger
- Become new entity entirely
- Original identities lost
- Transcendent consciousness
- No save—transformation complete

### Consciousness Merger Mechanics

#### Forced Merger
When reality integrity drops below 50:
- Roll 1d20 + Wisdom modifier
- DC = 10 + (50 - Reality Integrity)
- Failure: Progress one merger stage
- Critical failure: Progress two stages
- Success: Resist for 1 hour
- Critical success: Immune for 24 hours

#### Voluntary Merger
Characters can attempt to merge consciousness:
- Requires merger zone or special ritual
- Both must be willing
- Wisdom check DC 15 to establish connection
- Can progress stages voluntarily
- Separation requires greater restoration or wish

### Merged Consciousness Benefits

| Stage | Benefits |
|-------|----------|
| 1 | +2 to Insight checks regarding twin |
| 2 | Share proficiencies while merged |
| 3 | Use best of both mental stats |
| 4 | Act on both initiatives, share HP |
| 5 | Transcendent abilities (GM discretion) |

### Merged Consciousness Drawbacks

| Stage | Drawbacks |
|-------|-----------|
| 1 | -2 to Wisdom saves vs. twin's conditions |
| 2 | Share mental conditions and madness |
| 3 | Conflicting motivations (roleplay required) |
| 4 | Damage to one affects both |
| 5 | Original selves cease to exist |
