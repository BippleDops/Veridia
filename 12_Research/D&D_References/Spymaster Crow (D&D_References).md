Named after its mysterious leader, this intelligence network serves as neutral ground for information brokers, double agents, and those who trade in secrets. Despite its shadowy nature, the Crow's Perch maintains a reputation for reliability and discretion that spans both the depths of Aquabyssos and extends to contacts on the surface. ### The Central Rookery

*Hidden within the old Parliament Building's abandoned sections* The main headquarters of the Crow's Perch is concealed within the forgotten upper levels of Aquabyssos's Parliament Building.

- **Personal Information**: Blackmail material, hidden relationships, family secrets
- **Military Intelligence**: Troop movements, weapons shipments, strategic plans **Pricing Structure:**
- Minor gossip: 10-50 gold pieces
- Significant intelligence: 100-500 gold pieces

**Message Delivery**: Secure communication between distant parties
**Investigation Services**: Private inquiries into specific individuals or events
**Negotiation Facilitation**: Neutral ground for sensitive diplomatic exchanges ### The Crow's Code

1. **Neutrality**: The network serves no single faction or government
2. **Discretion**: Client confidentiality is absolute
3. **Reliability**: Agreements are kept regardless of personal cost
4. **Self-Preservation**: The network's survival takes priority over any single operation
5. **No Innocents**: Operations never target children or the genuinely helpless ### Punishment for Betrayal


Those who betray the network face:
- Complete exposure of all personal secrets
- Blacklisting from all legitimate business in Aquabyssos
- Active campaign to destroy reputation and relationships
- In extreme cases, permanent removal from the city ### The Missing Spymaster

**Level**: 6-10

Crow has disappeared without a trace, leaving the network in chaos. The party must investigate the disappearance while various factions attempt to either destroy or take control of the intelligence network. ### The Double Agent

**Level**: 4-8

The party discovers that someone close to them is reporting their activities to the Crow's network. They must decide whether to confront this person, attempt to feed false information, or try to turn them into a double agent. ### The Information War

**Level**: 8-12

Two major factions are using the Crow's network to conduct espionage against each other. The party becomes caught in the middle as both sides try to recruit them and the network struggles to maintain neutrality. ### The Blackmail Scheme

**Level**: 3-6

A rival organization is attempting to expose and blackmail prominent citizens using information stolen from the Crow's files. The party must recover the stolen intelligence before it destabilizes the government. ### The Perfect Heist

**Level**: 10-15

The Crow offers the party an impossible job: steal something from the most secure location in Aquabyssos. Success would gain them a powerful ally and valuable information, but failure would make them enemies of forces too dangerous to ignore. ### Crow's True Identity

Spymaster Crow is actually Lady Vivienne Deepcurrent, a presumed-dead noble who faked her own death to escape an arranged marriage. She now lives multiple identities while coordinating the intelligence network from the shadows. ### The Shadow Parliament Connection

The Crow's network has deep connections to the Shadow Parliament, serving as their unofficial intelligence arm while maintaining the appearance of independence. This relationship provides protection but also creates dangerous obligations. ### The Surface Contact

One of the network's most valuable assets is a deep-cover agent operating in a major surface nation's government. This contact provides early warning of surface military actions but also makes the network a target for surface intelligence services. ### The Shard Information

The Crow possesses detailed intelligence about the locations and capabilities of several of the Seven Shards but has kept this information secret due to its dangerous implications for the balance of power. ### Network Resources

The Crow's network provides mechanical benefits to those who gain their favor: **Information Contacts**: Characters can make Investigation checks with advantage when seeking information in Aquabyssos
**Safe Passage**: Access to safe houses provides secure rest locations and escape routes
**Equipment Access**: Specialized gear including disguises, forgeries, and communication devices
**Early Warning**: Advance notice of threats, ambushes, or political developments ### Favor System

The network operates on a favor-based economy:
- **Minor Favors**: Simple information or small services
- **Major Favors**: Significant intelligence or dangerous missions
- **Life Debts**: Saving network members or providing crucial services ### Security Measures

**Coded Communications**: All messages use rotating ciphers (DC 20 Intelligence check to decode without keys)
**Counter-Surveillance**: Network locations have magical and mundane early warning systems
**Loyalty Tests**: Regular missions designed to test member commitment and identify potential traitors ### Hazards

**Exposure Risk**: Characters associating with the network may be targeted by rival organizations
**Information Overload**: Access to too much sensitive information can make characters targets for elimination
**Moral Compromise**: Network missions may require actions that conflict with character values ### The Crow's Vault

Hidden within the Central Rookery:
- 50,000 gold pieces in various currencies
- Blackmail material on 200+ individuals
- Maps of secret passages throughout Aquabyssos
- Codes for accessing foreign intelligence networks ### Specialized Equipment

**Crow's Eye** (Uncommon): A crystal that allows scrying on specific locations within Aquabyssos once per day
**Raven's Cloak** (Rare): Provides advantage on Stealth checks and resistance to divination magic
**Sparrow's Cipher Wheel** (Uncommon): Allows automatic decoding of the network's messages
**Magpie's Mask** (Rare): Changes the wearer's appearance and voice for up to 8 hours ## Campaign Integration The Crow's Perch serves multiple campaign functions:

- **Information Hub**: Provides plot hooks and background information
- **Neutral Ground**: Safe meeting place for enemies who need to negotiate
- **Moral Complexity**: Forces decisions about loyalty, betrayal, and the cost of information
- **Resource Management**: Valuable services that come with strings attached ### Relationship Development

The network's relationship with the party can evolve:
1. **Strangers**: Network observes party but doesn't interact
2. **Contacts**: Occasional information exchange for payment
3. **Clients**: Regular services provided for ongoing relationship
4. **Assets**: Party becomes trusted operatives with special privileges
5. **Partners**: Deep integration with network goals and operations
6. **Leadership**: Party members could eventually join or lead the organization ## Connections to the Wider World The Crow's network connects to numerous other locations and organizations:


- **Parliament of Echoes**: Unofficial intelligence arm
- **Foreign Nations**: Deep-cover assets in multiple governments
- **Merchant Guilds**: Commercial intelligence partnerships
- **Criminal Organizations**: Uneasy truces and information trading
- **Religious Orders**: Some clerics serve as information sources
- **The Seven Shards**: Possesses crucial intelligence about shard locations and effects *The Crow's Perch represents the shadowy underbelly of diplomacy and politics in Aquabyssos. In a world where information can be more valuable than gold and secrets can topple governments, the network serves as both a vital service and a constant reminder that someone is always watching from the shadows.* ## Player-Facing Summary Spymaster Crow is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
