# Barrier Reaver (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a small metal key)

**Duration**: 1 round


## Effects
You can force an opening in one magical barrier within range, including spells such

*antimagic field, prismatic wall, wall of fire, wall of stone*, and so on. You automatically open a hole in any barrier created through a spell of 4th level or lower. For a barrier created with a higher-level spell, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spellâ€™s level. On a successful check, a hole appears.

Until the end of your next turn, you and other creatures may walk through the hole, cast spells through it, attack through it, and so on.

At the end of your next turn, the hole closes, inflicting 4d6 force damage on any creature still in the hole and shunting the creature either inside or outside the wall (50% chance of either).
