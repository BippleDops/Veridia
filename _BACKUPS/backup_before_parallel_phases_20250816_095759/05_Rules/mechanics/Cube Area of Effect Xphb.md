--- # Cube [Area of Effect]

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 364. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* A Cube is an area of effect that extends in straight lines from a point of origin located anywhere on a face of the Cube. The effect that creates a Cube specifies its size, which is the length of each side. A Cube's point of origin isn't included in the area of effect unless its creator decides otherwise. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Cube area of effect xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
