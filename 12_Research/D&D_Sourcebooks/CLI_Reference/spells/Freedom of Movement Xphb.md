# Freedom of Movement
*4th-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a leather strap)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by [[difficult-terrain-xphb|Difficult Terrain]], and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's [[speed-xphb|Speed]] nor cause the target to have the [[conditions#Paralyzed|Paralyzed]] or [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] conditions. The target also has a [[swim-speed-xphb|Swim Speed]] equal to its [[speed-xphb|Speed]].

In addition, the target can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature imposing the [[conditions#Grappled|Grappled]] condition on it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.
