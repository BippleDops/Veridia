The following stat blocks are presented in alphabetical order. When the Dungeon Master uses a stat block, the DM may change details in it. - [[Giant Ape Xmm]] - [[giant-badger-xmm (beast)]] - [[Giant Bat Xmm]] - [[black-bear-xmm]] - [[giant-boar-xmm]] - [[brown-bear-xmm (beast)]] - [[Camel Xmm]] - [[cat-xmm (beast)]] - [[giant-constrictor-snake-xmm (beast)]] - [[giant-crab-xmm (beast)]] - [[Crocodile Xmm]] - [[dire-wolf-xmm]] - [[draft-horse-xmm (beast)]] - [[elephant-xmm (beast)]] - [[elk-xmm (beast)]] - [[frog-xmm (beast)]] - [[giant]] - [[giant]] - [[Goat Xmm]] - [[giant]] - [[giant-spider-xmm (beast)]] - [[giant]] - [[Goat Xmm]] - [[Blood Hawk Xmm]] - [[Imp Xmm]] - [[lion-xmm (beast)]] - [[lizard-xmm (beast)]] - [[Mastiff Xmm]] - [[mule-xmm (beast)]] - [[Giant Octopus Xmm]] - [[Giant Owl Xmm]] - [[Panther Xmm]] - [[pony-xmm (beast)]] - [[pseudodragon-xmm (dragon)]] - [[quasit-xmm (fiend)]] - [[Wererat Xmm]] - [[Raven Xmm]] - [[Reef Shark Xmm]] - [[riding-horse-xmm]] - [[Giant Scorpion Xmm]] - [[flaming-skeleton-xmm (undead)]] - [[slaad-tadpole-xmm (aberration)]] - [[sphinx]] - [[phase-spider-xmm (monstrosity)]] - [[sprite-xmm (fey)]] - [[Weretiger Xmm]] - [[venomous-snake-xmm]] - [[warhorse-xmm (beast)]] - [[giant-weasel-xmm (beast)]] - [[werewolf-xmm (monstrosity)]] - [[Zombie Xmm]] ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary 10 appendix b creature stat blocks is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of 10 appendix b creature stat blocks as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around 10 appendix b creature stat blocks. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Alliance - Manipulate succession ## Plot Hooks - A noble needs help delivering before the new moon
