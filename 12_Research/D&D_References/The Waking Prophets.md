## Overview
The Waking Prophets believe that sleep is a curse that separates consciousness from divine truth. This ascetic order practices extreme sleep deprivation, claiming that exhaustion-induced visions reveal authentic prophecy. Members undergo rigorous training to function without sleep while maintaining prophetic clarity.

## Practices and Rituals
**The Vigil:** New members stay awake for 72 consecutive hours
**Stimulant Ceremonies:** Consumption of magical alertness enhancers
**Prophecy Sessions:** Group meditation during extreme exhaustion
**Sleep Denial:** Advanced members sleep only 1-2 hours per week
**Vision Recording:** Detailed documentation of exhaustion-induced revelations

## Hierarchy
**The Sleepless One:** Leader who hasn't slept in over five years
**Senior Prophets:** Members maintaining wakefulness for months
**Vision Keepers:** Specialists recording and interpreting prophecies
**Initiates:** New members learning sleep denial techniques
**The Fallen:** Former members who succumbed to sleep

## Prophectic Accuracy
The group has achieved notable success in predicting events, though critics argue their methods cause more hallucinations than genuine visions. Supporters point to several accurate predictions about political upheavals and natural disasters.

## Physical Effects
**Enhanced Perception:** Extreme alertness to environmental details
**Emotional Volatility:** Rapid mood swings and intense reactions
**Physical Deterioration:** Health problems from chronic exhaustion
**Psychic Sensitivity:** Increased magical and supernatural awareness
**Social Isolation:** Difficulty relating to "sleepers"

## Opposition
**Medical Professionals:** Condemn dangerous health practices
**Sleep Researchers:** Argue against fundamental beliefs
**Religious Orders:** View practices as heretical extremism
**Family Members:** Seek help for relatives involved
**Government Health Officials:** Consider intervention measures

## Resources
**Sacred Stimulants:** Magical substances preventing sleep
**Prophecy Archives:** Records of visions and interpretations
**Training Facilities:** Centers for sleep denial education
**Ficial Support:** Donations from believers and clients
**Underground Network:** Safe houses for avoiding authorities

## Recent Prophecies
1. "The drowning city will gasp for air when shadows rise"
2. "Seven bells will toll before the crystal shatters"
3. "The sleeper's crown will fall to wakeful hands"
4. "Blood-red tides bring messages from the deep"
5. "When all eyes close, the truth will finally open"

## Adventure Hooks

 ## DM Notes
The Waking Prophets offer opportunities to explore themes of fanaticism, the price of knowledge, and the boundary between revelation and madness. Their sleep deprivation creates genuine prophetic abilities but at severe personal cost, making them complex antagonists or troubled allies.

## Player-Facing Summary

The Waking Prophets is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of The Waking Prophets as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around The Waking Prophets.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
