# Sleep
*1st-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sand or rose petals)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each creature of your choice in a 5-foot-radius [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]] centered on a point within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] condition until the end of its next turn, at which point it must repeat the save. If the target fails the second save, the target has the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Unconscious|Unconscious]] condition for the duration. The spell ends on a target if it takes damage or someone within 5 feet of it takes an action to shake it out of the spell's effect.

Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, or that have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/immunity-xphb|Immunity]] to the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] condition automatically succeed on saves against this spell.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of sleep xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around sleep xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
