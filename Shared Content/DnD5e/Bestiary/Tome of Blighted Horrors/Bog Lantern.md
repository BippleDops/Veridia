## Special Traits
**Out of Phase:** Bog lanterns exist partially in the Ethereal Plane and partially in the Material Plane. This accounts for their resistance to most damage.

## Description
**Environment**: Swamp

**Organization**: Solitary

Whether the bog lantern is simply an undead will-o’-wisp raised by some odd negative energy current within the Great Lyme River or a separate creature that is superficially similar is unknown. The only traits the bog lantern seems to share with its potential cousin are its appearance and a desire to lure passers-by off the relative safety of the roads and paths meandering through the boglands that surround the Lyme.

A typical bog lantern is about 3 feet in diameter. Most of the time, they opt to float 4 to 5 feet off the ground, though they can move around in threedimensional space adroitly. On closer inspection, a bog lantern is observed to resemble a glowing skull etched with hundreds of mysterious runes that appear to penetrate completely through the glowing bone into its dark, inscrutable interior. A pair of glowing points of light hover within its dark eye sockets. Unlike the will-o’-wisp, a bog lantern cannot alter its color, brightness, or pattern of illumination. It is an “always on” glowing ball shedding yellow light equal to a torch. To simulate flickering patterns, bog lanterns move in and out of brush and other foliage, or cause their eye socket lights to roam around within the dark interior to cause light to shine intermittently through the dark runes that cover its surface. In this way, it can appear to be several flickering lights — perhaps a large colony of fireflies, for example.

Bog lanterns feed directly on the damage they inflict to their target’s mental abilities. They prefer to feed on mental energy from humanoids — they simply find the “taste” to be a delicacy — and in particular, young humanoids. However, many a trapper has found the desiccated remains of an alligator, panther, or other beast unfortunate enough to cross paths with a hungry bog lantern. A bog lantern attacks by lashing at adjacent foes with psychic energy. The attack appears to be a flash of light (sometimes confused with an electrical discharge because of the bog lantern’s similarities to a will-o’-wisp), but it’s actually the bog lantern forming a tendril-like appendage and touching its prey.
