## Description
Because I will not condone the sale of false cures to those with real afflictions, our liniments and salves purport instead to provide enhanced felicity to native abilities. We therefore supply snake-oil salesmen with stoppered jars purporting to “liven reflexes,” “improve stamina,” “enlarge muscles,” “induce hair growth,” “increase intelligence,” “ remove liver spots,” “enhance common sense.” Each bottle comes with complex instructions for application, and minuscule evidence of effectiveness.

## Additional Details
Successful wisdom check lets thief sell salve for `dice: 1d10` gp; 5% chance per usage of temporary placebo effect, improving related ability (if any) 1 point for `dice: 1d3` days.
