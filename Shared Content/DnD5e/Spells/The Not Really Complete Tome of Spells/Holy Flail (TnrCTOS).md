# Holy Flail (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered gemstone)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
You turn your holy symbol into a bludg-eoning weapon of your choice. This weapon does 1d12 + your spellcasting ability modifier in bludgeoning damage, plus 1d8 radiant (if you’re good or neutral) or necrotic (if you’re evil) damage. You are considered proficient in that weapon for the duration of the spell. If anyone other than you or another worshipper of your god attempts to use the weapon, the spell ends and the weapon reverts back into a holy symbol.
