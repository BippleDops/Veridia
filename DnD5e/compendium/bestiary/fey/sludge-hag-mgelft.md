## Description

You can smell a sludge hag long before you see one. A super stinky smell like rotten eggs mixed with old flower water lingers whenever a sludge hag is around. Sludge hags also tend to leave oily, dark trails of goop around the locations they inhabit. Small critters who venture too close will become covered in the oily goop and require the help of another creature to get clean.

There are rumors that sludge hags were once pristine, fey creatures who became encased in gooey sludge after mistreating their environment. Another rumor is that sludge hags just have really itchy skin and the goop makes them feel relaxed.
