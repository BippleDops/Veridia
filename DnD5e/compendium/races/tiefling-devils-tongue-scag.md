## Traits

### Age

Tieflings mature at the same rate as humans but live a few years longer.

### Size

Tieflings are about the same size and build as humans. Your size is Medium.

### Darkvision

Thanks to your infernal heritage, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Hellish Resistance

You have resistance to fire damage.

### Infernal Legacy

You know the [thaumaturgy](/compendium/spells/thaumaturgy.md) cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the [hellish rebuke](/compendium/spells/hellish-rebuke.md) spell as a 2nd-level spell with this trait; you regain the ability to cast it when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level, you can also cast the [darkness](/compendium/spells/darkness.md) spell once per day with this trait; you regain the ability to cast it when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Infernal.

### Appearance

Your tiefling might not look like other tieflings. Rather than having the physical characteristics described in the Player's Handbook, choose 1d4+1 of the following features: small horns; fangs or sharp teeth; a forked tongue; catlike eyes; six fingers on each hand; goatlike legs; cloven hoofs; a forked tail; leathery or scaly skin; red or dark blue skin; cast no shadow or reflection; exude a smell of brimstone.

### Devil's Tongue

You know the [vicious mockery](/compendium/spells/vicious-mockery.md) cantrip. When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the [charm person](/compendium/spells/charm-person.md) spell as a 2nd-level spell once with this trait. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the [enthrall](/compendium/spells/enthrall.md) spell once with this trait. You must finish a long rest to cast these spells once again with this trait. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. This trait replaces the Infernal Legacy trait.
