# The Unremembered Parliament

*"Where the voices of the forgotten still cast their eternal votes."*

## Overview
A haunted legislative chamber beneath the current Parliament building where the spirits of Aquabyssos's first democratic representatives continue their debates. This forgotten room was sealed after a catastrophic political scandal, but the supernatural echoes of ancient political arguments still resonate.

The chamber exists in a state of temporal suspension, where ghostly parliamentarians endlessly re-enact their final, fateful session.

## History
Two centuries ago, before the current monarchy, Aquabyssos was governed by a democratically elected Parliament. A massive corruption scandal involving foreign influence and criminal cartels led to the government's collapse and the chamber's abandonment.

The traumatic end to democracy left such a psychic impression that the spirits of the parliamentarians remain trapped, forever debating the crisis that destroyed their system.

## Physical Description
- Circular chamber with tiered seating for 200 representatives
- Central speaking floor with ornate podium
- Gallery seating for public observers (now empty)
- Faded murals depicting democratic ideals
- Spectral energy creates cold spots and strange lights

## The Spectral Session
**Ongoing Debate**: The spirits endlessly argue about their final legislation
**Key Figures**: Ghostly Speaker, opposition leaders, and reform advocates
**Supernatural Effects**: Temporal echoes replay historical moments
**Communication**: Spirits can interact with living visitors under certain conditions
**Resolution**: The debate cannot end until historical justice is achieved

## Notable Spirits
**Speaker Cornelius Deepwater**: Still trying to maintain order
**Representative Sarah Justice**: Reform advocate who exposed the corruption
**Lord Marcus Goldcurrent**: Corrupt official whose crimes destroyed democracy
**The Foreign Agent**: Mysterious figure who orchestrated the scandal
**Common Citizens**: Gallery ghosts who died defending democracy

## Current Status
- Sealed chamber officially "under maintenance" for decades
- Only senior government officials know of its existence
- Supernatural activity occasionally detected by palace security
- Some politicians secretly visit seeking guidance from spirits
- Chamber's existence is state secret

## Supernatural Phenomena

## Accessing the Chamber
**Official Routes**: Require highest security clearance
**Secret Passages**: Hidden entrances through palace basements
**Supernatural Methods**: Some spirits can guide living visitors
**Emergency Access**: Maintenance tunnels during certain conditions
**Restricted Times**: Chamber is most active during significant political events

## The Unresolved Crisis
The spirits cannot rest until their final legislation is properly addressed:
- Anti-corruption measures that were never implemented
- Foreign influence investigations left incomplete
- Democratic reforms that died with the government
- Justice for those who died defending the parliament
- Acknowledgment of the truth about the government's fall

## Political Implications
- Evidence of corruption that could destabilize current government
- Democratic precedents that challenge monarchical authority
- Historical truth that contradicts official propaganda
- Unfinished business that affects current policies
- Spiritual mandate for political reform

## Adventure Hooks

## Secrets

- Chamber's power could be harnessed for supernatural purposes

## Potential Resolutions
