# Trap #44 - ''This Trap Is A Gas!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> Directly across the room from the "wall of spears" door can be found a typical three finger hole door under the stucco. Once it is opened the treasure hunters will find a corridor 10 feet wide 10 feet high, and 20 feet long. This hall ends in a bronze door.
> 
> The bronze door depicts upon its beautifully crafted surface a human figure wreathed in flames. The figure is beset by deamonic figures who are doing their best to destroy the flaming humanoid.
> 
> In the center of the door is a wheel Turning this device seems to be the only way to open the door.
> 
> Once the party begins to turn the wheel, a cap in the center of the wheel pops off giving vent to a thin high pitched hissing sound. There is a 30% chance (L3) someone in the party will recognize the danger. And in any event the unusual noise will doubtless have the party scrambling back to the edge of the Thresher room.
> 
> If the individual turning the wheel is made of sterner stuff, or is too stupid to care, check to see if he is holding a torch, or if there is someone within 5 feel of him holding a torch, lamp or like incendiary device. If there is, then an unpleasent explosion occurs. The door is hollow and solid metal. It was chHled as much as possible then pumped full of an explosive gas, and the wheel driven in. Once the wheel is turned the venting system in its center releases the gas. If the delver stays with the door despite the hissing and an explosion results, there will be relitively little gas present. The delver at the door will find all his cloth garments on fire, as well as his hair, but if he thinks quickly he can save himself, or be saved by having the flames smothered in short order. There is a 20% chance (L2) that he will not panic.
> 
> If the delvers stayed with the door and the small explosion resulted, there will be a small jet of flame out the center of the wheel, until the gas has burned off then the door will be safe to open. (Note the party will almost certainly use the wheel to pull the door open, it will be very hot after all this time spouting flame. It will contribute to the comic fun if one or two members of the gang of thieves scorch their paws before they figure this out.)
> 
> The best result on this trap is if the party is in fact timorous. They will back up as far as they can, or better still retreat into the Thresher Room. If this is the case the gas will vent entirely into the hall way where it will collect, invisible but deadly. The party hearing the hissing die down will think that it is safe and reenter the hall. Whereupon the first torch, lantern, or such like incincliary device, will set off a massive explosion!
> 
> There is a 40% (L4) chance of injury from the concussion. The entire membership of the party in the hall at the time will be set on fire. Prompt action by any members not alight will be needed to aid these new members of Human Torchdom.
> 
> After all the fireworks the door will open easily.
> 
> The trap is a two skuller due to the fact that most of the potential damage is the result of the fires ignited by the gas, and these are easily deall with if the party acts quickly.
