# Guardian of Nature
A nature spirit answers your call and transforms you into a powerful guardian. The transformation lasts until the spell ends. You choose one of the following forms to assume: Primal Beast or Great Tree.

## Primal Beast
Bestial fur covers your body, your facial features become feral, and you gain the following benefits:


- Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.
- You gain [[darkvision]] with a range of 120 feet.
- You make Strength-based attack rolls with advantage.
- Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra `dice: 1d6|avg` (1d6) force damage on a hit.

## Great Tree
Your skin appears barky, leaves sprout from your hair, and you gain the following benefits:


- You gain 10 temporary hit points.
- You make Constitution saving throws with advantage.
- You make Dexterity- and Wisdom-based attack rolls with advantage.
- While you are on the ground, the ground within 15 feet of you is difficult terrain for your enemies.
