## Special Traits
**Summon Sea Creatures (1/Day):** All triton leaders (those with 50 or more hit points) have the ability to summon sea creatures as an action. Roll `dice: 2d6`: one die indicates how many rounds later the creatures arrive, and the other determines what type of creatures respond.


| **Die** | **Creatures** |
|---|---|
| 1 | 1–3 giant octopi |
| 2 | 3–10 sharks |
| 3 | 1 [[Sea Serpent, Fanged\|fanged sea serpent]] |
| 4 | 3–6 aquatic ghouls |
| 5 | 1–4 aquatic trolls |
| 6 | 1 drowned wight (a standard wight with a swim speed of 30 ft.) leading 3–8 aquatic ghouls |

**Triton Shaman:** Any group of 10 or more [[Dark Triton|dark tritons]] can be accompanied by one or more triton shamans.

**Multiattack:** The Lieutenant makes 2 melee attacks per round

**Trident:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (`dice: 2d6+2`) piercing damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any aquatic

**Organization**: Squad (2–8) or school (6–60)

## Description
Dark tritons resemble their more benevolent cousins, the normal tritons, but they are malevolent creatures. Just as the normal tritons are rumored to be servants of a sea god, the dark tritons are servants of oceanic demons of various types, most commonly the demon-prince Thalasskoptis.

Dark tritons have tentacles rather than the fishlike “legs” of normal tritons. They often ride giant moray eels as mounts when traveling in the dark depths of the sea, where they dwell in their castlelike lairs on the sea floor.

For every 10 dark tritons, either in their lair or in a hunting party, there will be a lieutenant with 50 hit points and two melee attacks per round (CR 3). For every two lieutenants, there will be a captain with 70 hit points and three melee attacks per round (CR 5). Roll a die for each leader; for each even result, add one triton shaman to the group (CR 2).
