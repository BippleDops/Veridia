## Special Traits
***Fey Ancestry.*** The shadow dancer has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put it to sleep.

***Shadow Jump.*** As a bonus action, the shadow dancer can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see. Both the space it teleports from and the space it teleports to must be in dim light or darkness. The shadow dancer can use this ability between the weapon attacks of another action it takes.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The shadow dancer makes three spiked chain attacks.

***Spiked Chain.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ( `dice: 2d6+3`) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or suffer one additional effect of the shadow dancer's choice:

## Description
Those who have fought shadow dancers describe the experience as similar to fighting a living darkness. Every dim alcove and darkened nook is a place from where the lithe and acrobatic shadow dancers can emerge to ambush their prey. Using this tactic, they attack their enemies from all angles with a flurry of entangling chains that hold fast and corrupt the flesh. When their quarry is helpless, others move in to help dispatch the prey. Then they loot the corpse for trinkets, anything colorful and lively to gaze at after they return to the gloom of the Shadowfell.
