# Exotics
## Overview
Among my favorite offerings, each of my exotics comes from a distant land and a fascinating people. More than any other section in my catalogue, this list of exotics showcases the finest and oddest products of Toril. In my journey to Maztica, I discovered that the Nexalan product tabacco (or tobacco) is far and away superior to our pipe weed. When questing through Shou Lung, I learned to appreciate the wonders of their candies, which have a subtle sweetness that can be more satisfying than the overwhelming flavor of Selgauntan candy. Perhaps the exotics I offer here will allow you to relive your own journeys, or perhaps awaken in you a hunger to travel to these distant lands.
