## Description
This [[Book|book]] contains coordination and balance exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the bookâ€™s contents and practicing its guidelines, your [[Dexterity|Dexterity]] score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.
