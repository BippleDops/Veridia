  "revised_prompt": "Imagine a heroic tabletop fantasy scene in a painterly style consistent with medieval-fantasy aesthetics. Central to this scene is an Aethermoor Courier-Class Airship, demonstrated through a blueprint cutaway. The perspective offers a top, side, and cross-section view, revealing its various decks, ballast, pressure hulls, and engines, manned by a crew of diverse gender and descent. The airship construction materials are grounded in a realm-specific fantasy setting, utilizing the natural resources of the realm such as cloudstone and brass. The design leans towards skyward romantic realism with wind-swept forms and nautical and aeronautical motifs. The color palette is dominated by navy, gold, and cloud-white with warm sun highlights. The blueprint should be clean, void of modern technology or signage. Important aspects of the blueprint are pointed out by numbered callout pins, avoiding lengthy text descriptions. These pins lead to a clean legend area that clearly explains what each pin refers to. The overall design should steer clear from modern symbolism, sci-fi UIs, anime styles, and photoreal CGI effects. Bask in the rich texture of traditional painterly strokes.",
