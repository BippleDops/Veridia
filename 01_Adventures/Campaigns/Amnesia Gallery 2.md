# Amnesia Gallery
*Where Memories Dance in Crystal and Shadow, Where Forgetting is Art*

## Overview

The Amnesia Gallery stands as one of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos's most enigmatic and dangerous cultural institutions—a floating exhibition space dedicated to the art of forgetting. Housed within a translucent crystalline sphere that drifts through the [02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Memory Depths]], this gallery displays memories that have been extracted, crystallized, and transformed into hauntingly beautiful artworks.

Visitors come to experience memories that are not their own, to lose unwanted thoughts, or to witness the strange beauty that emerges when consciousness is given physical form. The gallery exists in a state of controlled temporal flux, where past, present, and future memories intermingle in displays that shift and evolve with each viewer's psyche.

The establishment operates under the patronage of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Memory Merchants Guild|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/The Memory Merchants Guild, serving both as entertainment venue and research facility for the study of consciousness and temporal memory. However, beneath its artistic facade lies a deeper purpose: the systematic collection and cataloging of significant memories from across [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] for unknown ends.

## Physical Description & Atmosphere

### Exterior Architecture
The Amnesia Gallery floats within a massive hollow crystal sphere, approximately 300 feet in diameter, suspended in the twilight depths of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Memory Depths region. The crystal walls are semi-translucent, allowing glimpses of the swirling exhibitions within while filtering the deep-sea bioluminescence into an ethereal, ever-changing light show. Tendrils of crystallized thought energy spiral around the exterior, creating anchor points where smaller viewing pods and research laboratories attach like metallic barnacles.

The sphere's surface is carved with flowing script in the ancient [02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Deep Script]] language, forming memory-binding runes that prevent the exhibitions from escaping or contaminating visitors' minds. At night, these runes pulse with soft silver light, making the entire structure visible from miles away in the abyssal depths.

### Interior Layout
Upon entering through the main portal (a sphincter-like opening that reads visitors' intentions), guests find themselves in the **Reception Abyss**—a circular chamber with walls that display constantly shifting previews of the current exhibitions. The floor is made of memory-glass, allowing visitors to peer down into the gallery's lower levels where archived memories swim in containment pools like luminous jellyfish.

The gallery space itself defies conventional architecture, with exhibition areas that phase in and out of existence based on the collective consciousness of current visitors. Viewing platforms connected by bridges of crystallized thought allow movement between exhibits, while the central void serves as the main display space for large-scale memory installations.

### Atmospheric Effects
- **Memory Mist**: A faint, opalescent fog that carries echoes of displayed memories
- **Temporal Echoes**: Sounds from past and future exhibitions occasionally bleed through
- **Empathic Resonance**: Emotional atmospheres from memories affect room temperature and lighting
- **Chronological Drift**: Time moves slightly differently in various exhibition areas
- **Psychic Pressure**: Sensitive individuals may experience mild telepathic feedback

## Areas and Exhibitions

### The Welcome Wing - Entrance Level

#### Reception Abyss
The gallery's main entrance features a circular reception desk staffed by [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Memory Attendants—beings whose faces constantly shift between different identities they've absorbed.
