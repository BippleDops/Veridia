## Description
No one ever seems to have enough straps. I find that Iâ€™m always wishing for one more strap to attach another item to my pack or belt. We have a full range of lengths to choose from, or, we will sell a special strap kit, where you get a coil of leather strapping, and twenty-five self-tightening buckles. You cut the lengths you need. Short straps sell for 7 sp for a dozen, 12 sp for medium, and 1 gp for long. The kit is 2 gp.
