# Fear
*3rd-level, Illusion*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Cone)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a white feather)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each creature in a 30-foot [[cone-area-of-effect-xphb|Cone]] must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and have the [[conditions#frightened|Frightened]] condition for the duration.

A [[conditions#frightened|Frightened]] creature takes the [[actions#Dash|Dash]] action and moves away from you by the safest route on each of its turns unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a space where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends on that creature.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
