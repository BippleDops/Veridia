# Instrument of the Bards, Anstruth Harp
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/anstruth-harp.webp#right)

An Instrument of the Bards is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `2d4` Psychic damage.

You can play Anstruth Harp to cast one of the following spells: [[fly-xphb (spells)]], [[see-invisibility-xphb (spells)]], [[levitate-xphb (spells)]], [[Protection From Evil and Good Xphb]], [[mass-cure-wounds-xphb (spells)]] (level 5), [[ice-storm-xphb (spells)]], and [[wall-of-thorns-xphb (spells)]]. Once the Anstruth Harp has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
