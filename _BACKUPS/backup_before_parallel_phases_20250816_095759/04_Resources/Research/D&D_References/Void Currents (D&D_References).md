*Where Reality Drowns in Nothingness* > *"I have sailed every current in Aquabyssos, faced leviathans and survived the deepest trenches, but the Void Currents... They are not of this world. They are holes in the ocean where existence itself becomes uncertain, where the laws of reality flow away like water through a broken dam."*

> — [[Navigator Abyssal Truthseeker, sole survivor of the Meridian Deep Expedition ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview The Void Currents represent the most dangerous and mysterious phenomenon in all of [Aquabyssos]], a region of unstable reality where the fundamental laws of physics, magic, and existence itself become unreliable and chaotic. Located in the deepest, most remote parts of the ocean, these "currents" are not water movements at all, but rather tears in the fabric of reality that seem to drift through the depths like malevolent storms. Those few who have encountered the Void Currents and returned speak of impossible geometries, temporal loops, spaces where thought becomes reality, and areas where reality simply ceases to exist. The very name "Void Currents" reflects their nature - they are currents of nothingness that consume everything they touch. #### Spatial Anomalies

**Summary**: Secrets and Hidden Aspects > [!secret] DM Secret - The Conscious Void - Key information at a glance.

> The void currents are not random phenomena but manifestations of a vast, alien intelligence that exists outside normal reality. This entity is slowly consuming reality not out of malice, but because it literally cannot comprehend the concept of existence as we understand it. Every "void current" is actually a thought or dream of this entity bleeding into our reality. The entity is vaguely aware that its presence causes problems for "the small thinking things" (sentient beings), but it finds their existence as incomprehensible as they find its non-existence. However, > [!secret] DM Secret - The Reality Refugees

> Some of the "void echoes" are actually refugees from other realities that have been completely consumed by void phenomena. These beings managed to escape their dying realities by hiding in the spaces between worlds, but they can only manifest as echoes in our reality. A few of these refugees have been trying to warn Aquabyssos about the true scale of the void threat, but their communications are so distorted by their echo-state that they appear to be random void phenomena. > [!secret] DM Secret - The Artificial Origin
> The void currents were actually created by an ancient Aquabyssos civilization that was trying to transcend physical existence and become beings of pure thought and energy. Their experiment succeeded too well - they did transcend physical existence, but in doing so, they created wounds in reality where physical existence becomes impossible. The void currents are growing stronger because the consciousness of this ancient civilization is slowly "waking up" after millennia of dormancy, and as it becomes more aware, its incompatibility with physical reality becomes more pronounced. --- **Related Locations**:

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Void Currents as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Void Currents. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A document has gone missing and war looms
