As a bonus action, he can activate one of the following symbiotic abilities (3/day each):

- **Healing Polyps**: Regain 15 hit points
- **Toxic Barnacles**: Next melee attack deals additional `dice: 2d6` poison damage
- **Sensory Kelp**: Gain truesight 60 ft. For 10 minutes **Living Armor.** Crust's natural armor is composed of living barnacles, coral, and other sea creatures. When he takes damage, roll a d6. On 5-6, the armor absorbs the damage and he takes none. **Depth Adaptation.** Crust suffers no penalties from water pressure at any depth and can see clearly in the deepest ocean trenches. **Amphibious.** Crust can breathe air and water. **Spellcasting.** Crust is an 8th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save **DC 14**, +6 to hit). He has the following spells prepared: **Ranger Spells:**
- 1st level (4 slots): *detect magic*, *cure wounds*, *speak with animals*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *lesser restoration*, *locate object*, *water breathing* **Warlock Spells (Pact with the Deep Colony):**
- Cantrips (at will): *eldritch blast*, *mage hand*, *minor illusion*
- 4th level (2 slots): *confusion*, *polymorph*, *conjure minor elementals* ## Actions **Multiattack.** Crust makes two attacks: one with his Symbiotic Strike and one with either his Spine Launcher or a spell. **Symbiotic Strike.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`dice: 2d8` + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (`dice: 2d6`) acid damage from barnacle secretions. **Spine Launcher.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`dice: 2d6` + 1) piercing damage. The target must succeed on a **DC 16** Constitution save or be paralyzed for 1 minute (save ends). **Colony Burst (1/Day).** Crust releases a swarm of symbiotic creatures in a 20-foot radius. All creatures in the area must make a **DC 16** Dexterity saving throw. On failure, they take 21 (`dice: 6d6`) piercing damage and are restrained by clinging organisms for 1 minute. On success, half damage and no restraint. **Merge with Environment (1/Day).** Crust becomes one with the surrounding coral, rock, or ship hull for up to 1 hour. He gains resistance to all damage types and can move through solid objects, but cannot attack or cast spells. ## Description Crust Deepmeld represents the ultimate evolution of symbiotic adaptation in Aquabyssos's deepest trenches. What was once a typical merfolk has become a living ecosystem, his body serving as host to hundreds of different sea creatures that have formed a permanent, mutually beneficial relationship. Standing 5'8" but appearing much bulkier due to his living armor, Crust's original merfolk features are barely visible beneath layers of barnacles, coral, sea anemones, and other organisms. His skin has taken on a mottled gray-green hue, and bioluminescent patches pulse rhythmically across his form. Most striking are his eyes, which have adapted to complete darkness and now glow with an eerie blue light. His movements are deliberate and somewhat mechanical, as if coordinating the actions of his many symbiotic partners requires conscious effort. When he speaks, his voice carries harmonic undertones from the creatures living within his throat and chest cavity. Crust dwells in the Symbiosis Depths, an area of the deep ocean where the boundaries between individual organisms have broken down entirely. Here, entire ecosystems exist as single entities, and the concept of "self" becomes fluid and negotiable. ## Relationships **Allies:**

- **[[The Biomancers** - His primary faction, fascinated by his symbiotic evolution
- **Deep Colony Collective** - The eldritch entity that granted him his warlock powers
- **Abyssal Research Station** - Scientists who study the deepest ocean phenomena
- **The Depth Wardens** - Rangers who patrol the deepest waters **Enemies:**
- **Purity Zealots** - Religious fanatics who view his transformation as an abomination
- **[Surface Syndicate]]** - His specimens interfere with their smuggling operations
- **Rival Collectors** - Other beings who compete for the same rare organisms
- **Anti-Symbiosis League** - Those who fear the loss of individual identity **Complicated:**
- **[[Professor Aldric Crystalweaver** - Academic rivalry over bio-magical research methods
- **[Memory Harvester Kythara]]** - They trade specimens but disagree on ethics
- **His Original Family** - They barely recognize him and are disturbed by his transformation ## Quest Hooks 1. **The Dying Depths** - Crust's symbiotic partners are mysteriously dying, and he needs the party's help to discover what's poisoning the deepest waters before his own life support system fails. 2. **The Perfect Specimen** - Crust offers to guide the party to a legendary creature in exchange for permission to collect samples from it afterward. The creature may be more intelligent than expected. 3. **The Symbiotic Plague** - One of Crust's specimens has escaped and is creating unwilling symbiotic relationships throughout Aquabyssos. He needs help tracking it down before the transformation becomes irreversible. 4. **The Depth Expedition** - Crust requires an escort to the deepest ocean trench to collect a rare organism that could cure a devastating disease, but the journey will take them past ancient and hostile entities. 5. **The Colony War** - Crust's symbiotic collective is at war with another bio-entity, and he needs the party to serve as neutral mediators before the conflict spreads to threaten all of Aquabyssos. ## Motivations **Primary**: Study and preserve the unique life forms of the deepest ocean

**Secondary**: Perfect the art of beneficial symbiosis between different species
**Hidden**: Find a way to maintain his individual identity within his collective consciousness ## Roleplaying Notes **Personality**: Speaks in plural pronouns when excited or stressed, as his symbiotic partners assert themselves. Genuinely curious about all life forms but can seem callous about individual suffering. **Ideals**: "Life finds a way to adapt and survive. By understanding these connections, we—I—can help all species thrive together in harmony." **Bonds**: "Every creature that lives within me is family. We share experiences, knowledge, and purpose. To harm one is to harm us all." **Flaws**: "I sometimes forget that not everyone sees the beauty in radical transformation. My enthusiasm for symbiosis can blind me to others' legitimate concerns about losing their individual identity." **Voice**: His voice has strange harmonic qualities, as if multiple creatures are speaking in unison. When agitated, clicking and chirping sounds mix with his words. **Speaking Patterns**: - "We have seen such wonders in the depths..."

- "Adaptation is survival, and survival is beautiful..."
- "The collective memory suggests..."
- "Our symbiosis teaches us that individual strength comes from community..." **Mannerisms**: Constantly tending to his symbiotic partners—adjusting barnacles, feeding anemones with scraps, communicating through touch with various organisms. His bioluminescent patches pulse with his emotions. He collects small specimens compulsively, even during conversations. ## Player-Facing Summary The Barnacle is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Barnacle as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Barnacle. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is hunting a artifact for love
