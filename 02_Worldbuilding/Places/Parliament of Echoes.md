## Where Yesterday's Voices Decide Tomorrow's Fate

> *"In these halls, every word spoken echoes forever, and every vote cast weighs down reality itself."*

## 🏛️ Overview

The Parliament of Echoes serves as Aquabyssos's theoretical government, where ghost senators debate laws that apply to no one, yet somehow affect everyone. Built from crystallized sound and frozen time, the building exists in multiple temporal states simultaneously.

### Shadow Parliament

A parallel body of shadows that meets in the same space but different phase:
- Passes shadow legislation
- Votes on original replacement
- Planning the Dark Harvest
- Led by [[Senator Glaucus]]

### The Empty Vote

A vote was cast 200 years ago with no record of the question. The result: uimous yes. Effects unknown but Parliament changed afterward.

### The Speaker's Curse

Every Speaker has drowned in office. The last one's final words still echo: "The depths have voted."

### Timeline B

An entire alternate timeline's votes are stored here. They reference events that never happened and people who never existed.

### The Foundation Seal

Something is imprisoned in Level 5. The seal weakens each time Parliament fails to reach quorum.
