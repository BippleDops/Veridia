--- ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Survival & Transformation Mechanics for Aquabyssos > *"The depths don't kill you. They change you into something that can survive them."* ### Adaptation Points (AP)

Characters accumulate Adaptation Points through exposure to Aquabyssos's environment. These points track their transformation from surface dweller to deep dweller. #### Stage 5: Complete Transformation (100+ AP)

- **Final Form**: Choose transformation type: 1. **Living Current**: Become sentient water 2. **Coral Symbiont**: Merge with [[Corallion]] 3. **Shadow Being**: Become independent shadow 4. **Memory Entity**: Exist only in Memory Tides 5. **Depth Horror**: Become NPC monster
- **Player Options**: - Retire character as NPC - Continue playing as transformed entity (DM discretion) - Soul transfers to new body (rare quest reward) ### Pressure Zones

| Depth | Pressure DC | Frequency | Effects on Failure |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 0-500 ft | DC 10 | 1/hour | 1 exhaustion |
| 501-1,000 ft | DC 12 | 1/hour | 1 exhaustion + 1 AP |
| 1,001-5,000 ft | DC 14 | 2/hour | 1 exhaustion + 1d4 damage + 1 AP |
| 5,001-10,000 ft | DC 16 | 2/hour | 2 exhaustion + 2d4 damage + 2 AP |
| 10,001-20,000 ft | DC 18 | 1/10 min | 2 exhaustion + 4d4 damage + 3 AP |
| 20,001+ ft | DC 20 | 1/minute | 3 exhaustion + 6d4 damage + 5 AP | ### Shadow Independence Threshold

At 50+ AP, character's shadow begins developing independence: #### Daily Shadow Check

Roll d20 + AP above 50:
- **1-10**: Shadow mimics normally
- **11-15**: Shadow delays 1 second
- **16-19**: Shadow performs different gesture
- **20-24**: Shadow acts independently for 1 minute
- **25+**: Shadow fully separates for 1 hour #### Shadow Separation Events

When shadow acts independently:
1. **Benign**: Shadow helps with tasks (+2 to checks)
2. **Mischievous**: Shadow plays pranks (minor inconvenience)
3. **Hostile**: Shadow attacks (as Shadow demon)
4. **Replacement**: Shadow attempts to switch places ### Memory Tides


**Frequency**: Twice yearly + random surges
**Effect**: WIS save DC 16 or experience 1d100 random memories
**Results**:
- 1-20: Pleasant memories (inspiration)
- 21-50: Mundane memories (no effect)
- 51-75: Traumatic memories (frightened 1 hour)
- 76-90: Alien memories (1d6 AP + confusion)
- 91-99: Death memories (paralyzed 10 minutes)
- 100: Primordial memory (gain deep knowledge + 10 AP) ### Void Currents

**Navigation**: INT save DC 15 or become lost
**Exposure**: Lose 1d4 memories per hour
**Protection**: Memory Anchors provide advantage ### Crystal Zones

**Effect**: CON save DC 14 or gain crystallization
**Progression**: Similar to AP but leads to [[Crystal Plague]]
**Interaction**: Crystallization and Adaptation conflict ### Adaptation Items

| Item | Effect | Cost | Rarity |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| Memory Anchor | No AP gain 24hr | 500 gp | Uncommon |
| Shadow Lock | Prevent separation | 1,000 gp | Rare |
| Pressure Pills | Delay saves 1hr | 50 gp | Common |
| Depth Compass | Navigate currents | 750 gp | Uncommon |
| Surface Talisman | -1 AP/day | 5,000 gp | Very Rare |

9-12: Ink glands (obscure 10 ft sphere 1/day)

| Time | Activity | AP Risk |
|------|----------|---------|
| Dawn* | Pressure meditation | +0 |
| Morning | Travel/exploration | +1-3 |
| Noon* | Deep feeding | +1 |
| Afternoon | Social/political | +0-1 |
| Evening | Shadow hours | +2 |
| Night | Rest (if possible) | +1 |

*No true dawn/noon in depths, based on arbitrary cycle ## 📝 DM Notes

- Track AP secretly initially, reveal at Stage 1
- Describe changes gradually, not suddenly
- Allow creative solutions to slow adaptation
- Transformation can be campaign goal or threat
- Consider party split by adaptation levels
- Use adaptation for roleplay opportunities > *Remember: Adaptation isn't just mechanical - it's losing humanity piece by piece, trading identity for survival. Make it matter.* ## Player-Facing Summary Depth Adaptation System is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Depth Adaptation System as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Depth Adaptation System. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Covenant - Control trade routes ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[Comprehensive-World-Connection-Guide]]
