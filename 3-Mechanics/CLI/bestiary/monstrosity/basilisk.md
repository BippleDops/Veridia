    \ of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the creature to make a DC\
    \ 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk isn't [incapacitated](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#incapacitated).\
    \ On a failed save, the creature magically begins to turn to stone and is [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained).\
    \ It must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the\
    \ effect ends. On a failure, the creature is [petrified](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#petrified)\
    \ until freed by the  [greater restoration](/3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration.md)\
    \ spell or other magic.\n\nA creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes\
    \ to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't\
    \ see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes\
    \ again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make\
    \ the save.\n\nIf the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright\
    \ light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze."
