# Ammunition

## Overview
**Ammunition.** You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] only if you have ammunition to [[17 - Damage and Healing|fire]] from the weapon. Each [[7 - Time|time]] you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a [[Quiver|quiver]], case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a [[7 - Time|minute]] to [[14 - Actions in Combat|search]] the battlefield.



If you use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a melee [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]], you treat the weapon as an [[3 - Weapons|improvised]] weapon (see “[[3 - Weapons|Improvised Weapons]]” later in the section). A [[Sling|sling]] must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.
