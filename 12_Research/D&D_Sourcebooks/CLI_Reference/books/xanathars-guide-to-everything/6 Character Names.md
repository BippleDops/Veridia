# Character Names
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything, p. 173* 

Some players and DMs have a knack for coming up with  character names on the fly, while others find that task  more of a challenge. The tables in this appendix are  designed to make life easier for both kinds of people,  whether you're naming a player character, a nonplayer  character, a monster, or even a place.

Each table contains names that are associated with  a nonhuman character race in the player's handbook or a real-world ethnic or language group, with a focus  on groups from antiquity and the Middle Ages. You can select from the possibilities here, or use dice to determine a name.

Even though names are associated with races in this  appendix, a character might not have a name from their  own race. For instance, a half-orc might have grown up  among dwarves and have a dwarven name. Or, as DM,  you might decide that dragonborn in your campaign  have a culture reminiscent of ancient Rome and therefore use Roman names, rather than the dragonborn names suggested here.

See the names page for the full collection of name tables.

## Player-Facing Summary

6 character names is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of 6 character names as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around 6 character names.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
