Rarer breeds of griffons have the features of condors and panthers, while others resemble hawks and tigers. Regardless of their appearances, griffons are often associated with royalty and are widely called the Masters of Animals. Countless tales surround griffons. Roll on or choose a result from the Griffon Tales table to inspire stories about them. **Griffon Tales**`dice: [](griffon-xmm.md#^griffon-tales)`| dice: 1d6 | Legends Claim That Griffons... |


|-----------|--------------------------------|
| 1 | Attack anything in the skies near their lairs. |
| 2 | Curse their killers. Those who slay a griffon face the enmity of all animals. |
| 3 | Lay eggs with remarkable healing properties. |
| 4 | Prefer the taste of horses over all other prey. |
| 5 | Serve the first creature they see after hatching. |
| 6 | Won't attack those with royal blood. |

Truth is, if the griffons smelled how much horse meat trotted just below, folks would have worse than joy-flying mages and stirges to worry about!```statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of griffon xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around griffon xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[Griffon Xmm]]
