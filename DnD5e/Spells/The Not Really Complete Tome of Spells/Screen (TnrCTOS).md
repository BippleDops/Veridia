# Screen (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *8th-level*

**School**: *illusion*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Self (30-foot radius sphere)

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 8 hours


## Effects
You protect an area from divination, much the same as a *nondetection spell*, and at the same time create a *programmed illusion* of sight and sound that is detected by anyone using divination magic to spy on that area. You determine the contents of the illusion, but once you set it, you canâ€™t change the illusion.
