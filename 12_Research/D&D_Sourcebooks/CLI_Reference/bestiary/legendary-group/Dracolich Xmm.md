## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing a dracolich's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Sapping Mist.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is [[lightly obscured xphb|Lightly Obscured]] by pale fog. Whenever a creature other than the dracolich or one of its allies finishes a [[long rest xphb|Long Rest]] in that area, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] level.  
- **Soul Drain.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair have [[disadvantage xphb|Disadvantage]] on Death Saving Throws.  

If the dracolich is destroyed or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. The effects resume if the dracolich gains a new body (see its Soul Gem trait).

## Player-Facing Summary

Dracolich xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of dracolich xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around dracolich xmm.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
