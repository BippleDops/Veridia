# Trap #18 - "Boating Has It's Ups And Downs."
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> We left our party foundering around in a pleasant little grotto under the "flip-flop tiles". You may at this time call upon any of the denizens listed above to keep them entertained and sit back and watch the ensuing carnage. However if you desire, out of some misplaced sense of "fair play" to permit this farce to continue you can allow the party to see that the wooden trap door in the plank decking overhead leads down to a water level area of wood planking 10 feet wide and 30 feet long. On this planking are pulled up two boats.
> 
> If the party survives its dip, and climbs up onto the lower pier, or if they had "braved" the upper level of the seemingly rotten pier, opened the trap door, and climbed down the stairs, they may inspect the boats.
> 
> They will find two flat bottomed boats each 3 feet wide and 10 feet in length. The boats will seat 3 comfortably on thwarts in the bottom, 4 will fit with some scrunching, and 5 in a pinch although the boat would then be quite crowded. They are old, and made of wood, but they seem quite substantial. There is also a set of oars with each boat.
> 
> The fun begins again when the party finally decides to put the boats into the water. With no load in them the boats will float well, high and very dry. Once the tomb robbers actually enter the boats there will be a few moments when "surface tension" will keep the water from rushing in. Eventually the delvers will begin maneuvering the boats around heading out into the pool away from the pier.
> 
> This pool is dark, and clear, in the torch light you can see flickering shapes that make its inky depths seem less than inviting. There are 5 huge, much-eroded stalagmites that thrust out of the water at various points. The stalagmites are various sizes around 2 to 3 feet in diameteratthe water line,talking intoaccountthe erosion. Amemberofthe group could climb out onto one if they so desired. The pool is approximately 80 feet wide by 60 feet length. The ceiling at this point is out of easy sight overhead.
> 
> Once the group is under way the occupations of the "crews" should be, one with a torch, and very likely one, possibly two with the oars. It is at this point we will give the third, forth and in fact any others in the boat something very important to do: bail!
> 
> Boats are generally kept in a wet condition ( this happens when you spend a great deal of time in the water.) When the wood is wet it swells and keeps the spaces between the planks tightly sealed. These boats have lain here high and very very dry for thousands of years. Theolddrywoodof theboatshas shrunk causingtheseamsbetween the planks toopen. When the boats start moving around this exerts a variety of Lateral forces on them thus breaking the surface tension that was only just barely keeping them afloat. The water begins to literally pour in.
> 
> The boats will begin to fill quickly once the party has moved away from the pier. If the boat has only 3 people in it they can make it to one of the stalagmites . If they try for the pier there is a 80% chance (L2) of success. If the boat has 4people in it they have a 80% chance (L2) to make the stalagmites. A 4 man crew will have only a 60% chance (IA) to make the pier. If there are5 in the boat the chances of making even the stalagmites drops to 60% (IA), and Lo make the pier a dwindling 40% (L6). Any more than 5 in a boat and the pier is out of the question; it is a wonder they didn't go down without the leaks. A boat with more than 5 wiU have only a 40% chance (L6) of making one of the stalagmites.
> 
> If the party makes it back to the pier they can look around. If they go back up to the upper pier through the trap door they will find that it is more substantial then it seemed and iflhey check out the ceiling in the center of the left hand wall (see diagram) they will find a trap door. Opening it they will find a pair of Elfish canoes. (Elvish I thought he wash daidl) These are similar in construction to the birch bark canoes of certain American Indians, and being crafted by the elves they will float as long as they remain in one piece. They will hold up to three human sized people each.
