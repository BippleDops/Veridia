# Eldritch Staff

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Melee Weapon, Staff

**Rarity:** very rare

**Attunement**: *requires attunement*

**Weight**: 4 lbs.

**Damage:** 1d6 bludgeoning versatile (1d8)

## Description

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The staff has 10 charges and regains `dice: 1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice: d20`. On a 1, the staff is destroyed in an otherwise harmless burst of eldritch energy.

**Eldritch Attack** When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend up to 3 of its charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra `dice: 1d8` lightning damage.

**Eldritch Escape** If you take damage while holding the staff, you can use your reaction to expend 3 of the staff's charges, whereupon you turn [[Invisible]] and teleport yourself, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space that you can see. You remain [[Invisible]] until the start of your next turn or until you attack, cast a spell, or deal damage.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
