# Snare
*1st-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** S, M (25 feet of rope, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle with a 5-foot radius on the ground or the floor. When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.

This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Intelligence ([Investigation](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Investigation)) check against your spell save DC to be discerned.

The trap triggers when a Small, Medium, or Large creature moves onto the ground or the floor in the spell's radius. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down 3 feet above the ground or the floor. The creature is [restrained](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Restrained) there until the spell ends.

A [restrained](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Restrained) creature can make a Dexterity saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the creature or someone else who can reach it can use an action to make an Intelligence ([Arcana](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Arcana)) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the [restrained](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Restrained) effect ends.

After the trap is triggered, the spell ends when no creature is [restrained](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Restrained) by it.
