## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting.*** The deathlock's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At Will: *detect magic, disguise self, mage armor*

***Spellcasting.*** The deathlock is a 10th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma. It regains its expended spell slots when it finishes a short or long rest. It knows the following warlock spells:

Cantrips: *chill touch, mage hand, minor illusion, poison spray*
5th level (2 slots): *arms of Hadar, blight, counterspell, crown of madness, darkness, dimension door, dispel magic, fly, hold monster, invisibility*

***Turn Resistance.*** The deathlock has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

## Actions
***Deathly Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ( `dice: 3d6+3` necrotic damage).

***Grave Bolts.** Ranged Spell Attack:* +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one or two targets. Hit: 18 ( `dice: 4d8`) necrotic damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or become restrained as shadowy tendrils wrap around it for 1 minute. A restrained target can use its action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Description
Though deathlocks exist to serve their patrons, they retain some freedom when it comes to devising particular tactics and carrying out their plans. Powerful deathlocks recruit lesser creatures to help them carry out their missions and, in this capacity, become the masterminds behind vast conspiracies and intrigues that culminate in the accomplishment of great acts of evil.
