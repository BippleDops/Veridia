The Reflection Pools are a sacred site consisting of seven perfectly circular pools of unnaturally still water, each capable of showing visions of past, present, or future events. Located in the Temple District's quietest corner, these pools serve both religious and practical purposes for divination, meditation, and seeking guidance. ## The Seven Pools

1. **Pool of Memory** - Reveals past events
2. **Pool of Truth** - Shows present reality without illusion
3. **Pool of Possibility** - Displays potential futures
4. **Pool of Hearts** - Reveals emotional truths and desires
5. **Pool of Shadows** - Shows hidden or secret information
6. **Pool of Distance** - Observes remote locations
7. **Pool of Dreams** - Connects to sleeping minds ## Usage and Rituals

**Divination Services:** Oracles use pools for prophecy and guidance
**Investigation Aid:** Authorities consult pools for crime solving
**Personal Seeking:** Individuals seeking life direction
**Academic Research:** Scholars studying historical events
**Diplomatic Intelligence:** Covert observation of foreign activities ## Current Guardians

**Apprentice Seers:** Students learning divination arts
**Temple Guards:** Protection from misuse or disruption ## Adventure Hooks

2. False visions are being planted by unknown magical interference
3. Someone has poisoned one of the pools with corrupting magic
4. Vision reveals location of crucial information or artifact
5. Pool watchers request protection during dangerous divination ritual ## Services and Costs

**Location Scrying:** 300 gp to observe distant place

Use the Reflection Pools as plot devices to provide information, foreshadow events, or create red herrings. Visions should be symbolic rather than literal, requiring interpretation and potentially misleading parties into interesting complications. ## Player-Facing Summary Reflection Pools is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Reflection Pools as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Reflection Pools. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A letter reveals ancient history about the government
