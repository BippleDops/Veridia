# Tame Animal (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
You aid a beast in some way, such as by freeing it from a snare or defending it from a predator, and then cast this spell. The creature may make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, it will permanently become charmed by you. It will see you as a trusted ally.

Depending on the nature of the creature, it may or may not decide to follow you. If it doesnâ€™t, it will remember you the next time it sees you and still consider you a friend.

Any action that removes the charmed effect from the creature will instantly end this spell. How it reacts depends on how well you treated it.
