# Primal Savagery
*cantrip, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You channel primal magic to cause your teeth or fingernails to sharpen, ready to deliver a corrosive attack. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes `d10` acid damage. After you make the attack, your teeth or fingernails return to normal.

The spell's damage increases by `d10` when you reach 5th level (`2d10`), 11th level (`3d10`), and 17th level (`4d10`).
