# Mists of Madness
## Overview
*Magical trap*
This heavy purple mist can fill a large room and sits dormant at a height of 6 inches. When a living creature shows any sign of above animal intelligence (such as speaking, casting a spell, using tools or a weapon, etc.) while standing within the mist, the mist rises up and try to enter the creature's lungs. When the mists try to enter a creature's body, that creature must first succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. If the creature fails that saving throw, it must then succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain one form of long-term madness from page 260 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. Creatures who are aware they are standing in mists of madness have advantage on the Constitution saving throw.

A DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals the nature of the trap. A strong wind forces the mists to dissipate in 1d10 rounds.

Mists of madness never harm mind flayers. The mist was created by illithids.
