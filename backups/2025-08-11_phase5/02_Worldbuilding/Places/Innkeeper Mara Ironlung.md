# The Ironlung Tavern

*A beacon of warmth in the shadowy depths of [[Aquabyssos]]*

## Overview

The Ironlung Tavern stands as one of the few bastions of normalcy in the corrupted underwater realm of [[Aquabyssos]]. Built into a massive coral formation, this establishment glows with bioluminescent fungi that [[Mara Ironlung]] carefully cultivates. The tavern serves as a crucial safe haven for travelers, adventurers, and locals alike who seek respite from the encroaching shadow magic that plagues the realm.

## Physical Description

The tavern is carved directly into a living coral reef, with walls that pulse gently with natural light. The main hall features:
- **Breathing chambers**: Magically maintained air pockets for surface dwellers
- **Aquatic seating**: Floating kelp cushions and barnacle-encrusted tables
- **The Iron Lung**: A massive mechanical breathing apparatus that purifies the water and air, giving the tavern its name
- **Bioluminescent bar**: Made from petrified coral that glows in shifting blues and greens
