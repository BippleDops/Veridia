# Sough-Eel
## Overview
### Sough-Eel
![[zlklk22r.a0c.png|Sough-Eel|300]]
[[zlklk22r.a0c.png|open outside]]

*This massive eel, nearly 20 feet long, has pale hide almost translucent like a fish’s belly that is marred by great areas of sloughing flesh that hang loose in rotten folds. It is eyeless, with a row of small black nodules extending back from its snout, and has several small vestigial fins growing sporadically along the length of its body. Its mouth however, is the most noticeable feature, occupying nearly a quarter of its length and splayed wide with a crowd of jagged fangs.*

## Special Traits
**Swallow.** The sough-eel makes its bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling and that it’s hit with 2 consecutive gnaw attacks. If the bite attack hits, the creature takes the bite damage and is swallowed. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, and it’s unaffected by anything happening outside the sough-eel or by attacks from outside it. It takes `dice: 4d6` acid damage at the start of each of the sough-eel’s turns. Up to two Medium or smaller creatures can be inside the sough-eel at one time. If the sough-eel takes 30 or more damage on a single turn from a creature inside it, the sougheel must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution save at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the slougheel. A swallowed creature can get out of the sough-eel by using 15 feet of movement, but only after the sough-eel is dead.

## Actions
**Melee Attack—Bite:** +9 to hit (reach 10 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d10 + 6` piercing damage, and a creature must make a successful DC 15 Con saving throw or contract sight rot. A Medium or smaller target is also grappled (escape DC 16) and restrained. The sough-eel can’t bite a different target while it has a creature grappled.

**Melee Attack—Gnaw:** +9 to hit (one creature already grappled at the start of the sough-eel’s turn). Hit: `dice: 1d8 + 6` piercing damage. The sough-eel makes this attack as a bonus action at the start of its turn. A creature that’s hit on 2 consecutive rounds by the sough-eel’s gnaw attack may be swallowed (see below).

## Description
**Environment**: Sea

**Organization**: Solitary or school (4-8)

These vile predators are found exclusively in the dark, filthy waters of the Great Lyme River and Fetid Sea in the vicinity of the City-State of Castorhage. Some have speculated that they were once a temperate water variety of moray eel that was indigenous to the area until the Lyme was tainted by the noxious effluvia from the metropolis known colloquially as the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]]. Unlike most aquatic species that were unable to survive the poisoning of the waters, the sough-eel population managed to endure the deadly influx but was changed in the process. Immune to most disease and poison, the sough-eels — carriers of their own endemic pathogen — are now affected by it chronically so that their hide is in a constant state of dying and sloughing off in large swaths and layers. This has not seemed to affect their ability to survive in their harsh environment, and every native of the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] knows better to enter the water of the Lyme for fear of the voracious attacks of the ever-present sough-eels.
