While holding this weapon, you can take a [[Action Xphb]] to alter its form, turning it into a 6-inch rod (for ease of storage) or a 10-foot pole, or reverting it a Quarterstaff; the weapon will elongate only as far as the surrounding space allows.

You can't use this property again until you finish a [[short-rest-xphb]] or [[long-rest-xphb]]. ## Ranged Weapon (Quarterstaff Form Only) This weapon has [[item properties#Thrown|Thrown]] with a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with the weapon, it flies back to your hand. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 291.
