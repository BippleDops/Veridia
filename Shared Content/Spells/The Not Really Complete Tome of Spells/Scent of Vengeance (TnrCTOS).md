# Scent of Vengeance (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a token once pos-sessed by the quarry)

**Duration**: 1 week


## Effects
You gain the ability to unerringly track any living creature that has directly caused injury or insult to you or to an allied creature, by that creatureâ€™s smell. This spell does not work on celestials, elementals, fiends, or undead.

You may only cast this spell at the site of the insult or injury. You can follow the scent even if the quarry swims or flies. The only way to throw you off the trail is to use teleportation magic, although you can pick up the trail again from the other side of the tele-port.
