# War Caster
## Overview
You have practiced casting spells in the midst of combat, learning techniques that grant you the following benefits:

## Requirements and Restrictions
**Prerequisite**: The ability to cast at least one spell

## Effects
- You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain your concentration on a spell when you take damage.
- You can perform the somatic components of spells even when you have a weapon or shield in one hand.
- When a hostile creatureâ€™s movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can use your reaction to cast a spell at the creature, rather than making an opportunity attack. The spell must have a casting time of 1 action and must target only that creature.
