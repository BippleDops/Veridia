# Scriptorium
*Level 9 Bastion facility*  

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Space**: Roomy (16 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 1
- **Order**: craft

A Scriptorium contains desks and writing supplies.

## Craft Options

When you issue the "Craft" order to this facility, choose one of the following options:

- **Craft.** Book Replica. You commission the facility's hireling to make a copy of a nonmagical Book. Doing so requires a blank book. The work takes 7 days.  
- **Craft.** Spell Scroll. You commission the facility's hireling to scribe a [[spell-scroll-xdmg|Spell Scroll]] containing one Cleric or Wizard spell of level 3 or lower. The facility has the necessary [[calligraphers-supplies-xphb|Calligrapher's Supplies]], and the hireling meets all the prerequisites needed to scribe the scroll. The ""Crafting Equipment"" section in the "Player's Handbook" specifies the time needed to scribe the scroll and the cost of the scroll, which you must pay.  
- **Craft.** Paperwork. You commission the facility's hireling to create up to fifty copies of a broadsheet, a pamphlet, or another loose-leaf paper product. The work takes 7 days and costs you 1 GP per copy. At no additional cost in time or money, the facility's hireling can distribute the paperwork to one or more locations within 50 miles of your Bastion.

## Player-Facing Summary

Scriptorium is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of scriptorium as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around scriptorium.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties scriptorium to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at scriptorium to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to scriptorium active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
