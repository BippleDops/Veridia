## Description

When found, the book contains the following spells: [[contingency]], [[fireball]], [[gust of wind]], [[Leomund's Tiny Hut (Ritual)|Leomund's Tiny Hut]], [[magic missile]], [[thunderwave]], and [[wall of force]] . It functions as a spellbook for you.

While you are holding the book, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.

The book has 3 charges, and it regains `dice: 1d3` expended charges daily at dawn. You can use the charges in the following ways while holding it:

If you spend 1 minute studying the book, you can expend 1 charge to replace one of your prepared wizard spells with a different spell in the book. The new spell must be of the evocation school.

When one creature you can see takes damage from an evocation spell you cast, you can use your reaction and expend 1 charge to deal an extra `dice: 2d6` force damage to the creature and knock the creature [[Prone]] if it is Large or smaller.
