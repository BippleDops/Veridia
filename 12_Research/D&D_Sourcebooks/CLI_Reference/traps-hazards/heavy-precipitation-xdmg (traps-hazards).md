# Heavy Precipitation
*Environmental Hazard*  

Everything within an area of heavy rain or heavy snowfall is [[lightly-obscured-xphb (variant-rules)]], and creatures in the area have [[Advantage Xphb]] on all Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) checks. Heavy rain also extinguishes open flames.
