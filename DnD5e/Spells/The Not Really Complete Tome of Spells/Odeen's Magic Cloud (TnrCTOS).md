# Odeen's Magic Cloud (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *cantrip*

**School**: *Evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 90 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
You create a cloud that fills a five-foot cube at any point within range. You can freely move the cloud at a speed of 40 feet by concentrating on it; when you stop concentrating, it drifts on the wind. When you create the cloud, you choose one of three options:

♦ ***Misty Cloud.*** You direct the cloud to cover a small area on the ground, typically around an object or creature. The cloud’s area is lightly obscured.

♦ ***Storm Cloud.*** You create a personal storm cloud directly over a target. At the beginning of your round, you may use a bonus action to direct a lightning bolt to strike the target. The target may make a Dexterity saving throw, or take 1d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or no damage on a successful one. ♦ ***Rainbow Cloud.*** The cloud emits anywhere up to five small, pretty rainbows. This is primarily designed to impress viewers.
