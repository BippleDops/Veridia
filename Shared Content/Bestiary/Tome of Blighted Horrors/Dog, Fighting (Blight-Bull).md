## Actions
**Melee Attack—Bite:** +4 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d4 + 2` piercing damage, and a Small or smaller creature is grappled (escape DC 9). A grappled creature takes `dice: 1d4 + 2` piercing damage at the end of its turn.

## Description
**Environment**: Urban

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, or pack (3-12)

Dogs bred and trained specifically to fight are tougher than normal breeds. They are typically garbed in light barding and have been taught to lock their jaws to bring opponents down. Their training has suppressed some of their natural instincts and rendered them quite specialized; consequently, they aren’t of much use for other activities, such as tracking, but continue to fight past the point when other dogs would no longer be able to continue.
