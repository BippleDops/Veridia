# Desertsmouth Mountains
The Desertsmouth Mountains, also known as the Tethyamar Mountains and formerly known as the Teshan Mountains, were a range of mountains that separated the Dalelands region, to the east, from the great desert of Anauroch, to the west.

## Description
The mountains were known far and wide as a range of barren peaks that were infested with monstrous creatures.

## Geography
The mountains marked the western border of Daggerdale in the Dalelands, and the eastern sands of the Anauroch desert. They were bordered to the south by the Stonelands of Cormyr, and to the north by the Border Forest.

The sands west of mountains held within them one known portal, the Cat's Gate, which let to the plane of Cynosure.

## Flora
The Desertsmouth Mountains were a home to a species of rare wild white roses.

## Geographical Features
The westernmost peak of the mounts was Rausrawna, previously known as Mount Shaddath, and its southernmost peak was referred to as "the Watcher",.

## History
Large amounts of adamantine and iron were found in the Year of Adamantite Ore, −149 DR in the Teshan Mountains, as they were then known. The great dwarven realm of Tethyamar was founded within the mountains a few years later, in the Year of Depths Unknown, −145 DR.

Both Tethyyamar and the The Lost Vale of Tarkhaldale once stood in the Desertsmouth mountains, until they both fell some 87 years before the signing of the Dales Compact. They were overwhelmed by the orc and goblinoid army that marched from Hlundadim.

In the Year of the Many Mists, 1282 DR, the returned lich Sammaster made his lair within the Desertsmouth peaks, using them as a base of operations to orchestrate the activities of the Cult of the Dragon.

In the mid–14th century, the depths of the mountains became the site of a full-scale war between the native orcs and dwarves of Tethyamar.
