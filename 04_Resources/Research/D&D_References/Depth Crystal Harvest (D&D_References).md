The Depth Crystal Harvest is a treacherous mining operation located in the deepest trenches surrounding Aquabyssos, where rare pressure-formed crystals grow in the extreme depths. These sites are both essential to the city's economy and extraordinarily dangerous to access. The crystals harvested here power much of Aquabyssos's magical infrastructure, from pressure regulation systems to communication networks. However, the extreme depth and unstable geology make these operations among the most hazardous in the known world. ## Layout

Multiple mining sites scattered across three major trench systems, connected by reinforced pressure tubes and emergency shelters. Each site consists of extraction platforms, worker habitats, and crystal processing facilities built into the trench walls. ## Mining Operations

**Primary Sites**: Seven active extraction points at depths of 15,000-20,000 feet
**Support Infrastructure**: Pressure-resistant habitats, emergency shelters, transport tubes
**Processing Facilities**: On-site crystal cutting and preliminary refinement
**Safety Systems**: Emergency ascent pods, medical stations, pressure monitoring ## Hazards

**Environmental**: Crushing pressure, unstable geology, equipment failure
**Biological**: Deep predators, pressure-adapted hostile creatures
**Magical**: Crystal energy surges, temporal distortions
**Economic**: Corporate sabotage, worker strikes, supply shortages ## Resources Produced

**Depth Crystals**: Primary magical power source
**Pressure Gems**: Used in advanced equipment manufacturing
**Rare Minerals**: Secondary mining products
**Research Materials**: Specimens for magical research ## Adventure Hooks

1. Rescue mission after catastrophic mining accident
2. Investigation into sabotage affecting multiple sites
3. Exploration of newly discovered crystal caverns
4. Negotiation with deep-dwelling creatures claiming territory ## DM Notes

Use this location for high-stakes rescue missions and industrial espionage. The extreme environment creates natural tension and urgency. Corporate politics can drive ongoing campaigns. ## Player-Facing Summary Depth Crystal Harvest is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Depth Crystal Harvest as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Depth Crystal Harvest. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A document has gone missing and war looms
