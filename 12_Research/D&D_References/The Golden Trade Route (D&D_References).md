## Overview
The Golden Trade Route is the primary overland commercial highway connecting [[Port Meridian|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]], [[Crystalhaven|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven]], and [[The Sundered Peaks|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Sundered Peaks]], facilitating the flow of goods, information, and political influence across the continent while facing constant threats from bandits, monsters, and criminal organizations.

## Player-Facing Summary

The Golden Trade Route is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of The Golden Trade Route as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around The Golden Trade Route.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
