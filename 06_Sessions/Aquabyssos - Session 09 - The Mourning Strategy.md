The party descends into [[[The Mourning]] Depths]] to find it transformed—instead of a city of sorrow, it's erupting with impossible joy. Citizens laugh while crying blood, dance while their bodies decay, celebrate while reality collapses. The [[[The Sorrowmaster]] floats above, glowing with paradoxical happiness: "I've discovered the ultimate sorrow—the grief of never being able to grieve again. Help me. Kill my joy before it destroys everything." ### Scene 1: [[The Cathedral of [Sighs Inverted]]

**Location**: Cathedral transformed into [[Laughing Halls **Situation**: Navigate through forced joy plague **Conflict**: Happiness is literally deadly here **Discoveries**:
- Joy and sorrow are two sides of Singer digestion
- [The Sorrowmaster]] weaponized their own paradox
- Every laugh erases a memory of sadness
- [[The Grief Bomb needs pure, undiluted sorrow **[Joy Plague]] Mechanics**:
- **CON Save **DC 16**** or laugh uncontrollably

**Location**: [[Economic District of Sorrow **Situation**: Withdraw stored sorrow before joy consumes it **Conflict**: Other factions racing for same resources **Discoveries**:
- [[[Shadow Duchess]] Nyx]] has been hoarding grief
- The [[[The Scattered Emperor]] arrives, fully unified
- Ancient grief from pre-Cataclysm still exists
- Someone's been stealing sorrow for years **[[Sorrow Economics**:
- Party must gather 1,000 [Grief Units]]
- Can trade memories for sorrow
- Can sacrifice happiness permanently
- Can steal from other factions ### Scene 3: [[The Unity Council

**Location**: [The Suicide]] Bridges (now [[Life Bridges) **Situation**: All faction leaders meet for final strategy **Conflict**: Agreeing on who makes ultimate sacrifice **Discoveries**:
- Every continent must contribute to the bomb
- Shadows volunteer to be ammunition
- [The Emperor]] reveals he IS multiple people
- Marina's versions offer collective solution **[[The Council Vote**:
- Who delivers the bomb into Singer consciousness
- Which timeline to preserve if successful
- Whether to save shadows or originals
- How much of reality to sacrifice ### Scene 4: [The Sorrowmaster]]'s Ascension

**Location**: [[The Depths [Below Depths]] **Situation**: [[Transform Sorrowmaster into delivery system **Conflict**: Must make them sad enough to function **Discoveries**:
- [The Sorrowmaster]] was the first Singer victim
- They remember reality before Singers existed
- Their joy is from knowing the solution
- Someone must take their place as Sorrowmaster **[[Ascension Ritual**:
- Requires 100 [Grief Units]] per round
- 10 rounds to complete

**Summary**: 🎪 [Cliffhanger Ending]] - Key information at a glance.

[[The Grief Bomb is complete—a crystallized sphere of pure, concentrated sorrow from millions of beings across centuries. [The Sorrowmaster]], transformed into a living delivery system, prepares to ascend into the Singer's consciousness. But as the ritual completes, the [[Singer Beyond SPEAKS through reality itself: "I... Remember... Feeling. You tiny things... You still feel. I consumed twelve realities seeking what you have. Give me your sorrow. Give me your joy. Give me... Meaning." The [[[The Scattered]] Emperor]], unified for the first time in centuries, steps forward: "We were never fighting it. We were trying to teach it. [[The Cataclysm, the shadows, the harvest—all of it was to show a god how to grieve." [[[Shadow Duchess]] Nyx]] and her original self merge: "The bomb won't kill it. It will make it mortal. It will make it capable of death. And then..." Marina—all versions speaking in unison—completes the thought: "And then we decide if a god deserves mercy." [[The Sorrowmaster looks to the party: "The choice is yours. Detonate the bomb and make the Singer mortal but traumatized, or try to teach it empathy first. But choose quickly—reality has about ten minutes before complete digestion." The ocean above turns transparent, revealing the impossible anatomy of the [Singer Beyond]]. Its eyes—if they can be called that—focus on the party. It whispers through dimensions: "Please. I just want to understand what it means to exist." --- ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*
