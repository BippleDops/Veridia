# Scroll of Tarrasque Summoning
*Scroll, legendary*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

Using an action to read the scroll causes the [tarrasque](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/tarrasque.md) (see the creature's entry in the Monster Manual) to appear in an unoccupied space you can see within 1 mile of you. The tarrasque disappears when it drops to 0 hit points and is hostile toward all creatures other than itself.
