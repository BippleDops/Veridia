## Lore Details

Legends speak of invisibility xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around invisibility xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties invisibility xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
