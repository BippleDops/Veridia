## Special Traits
**Camouflage:** Because strangle weed looks like normal seaweed, it can be recognized as hazardous before it attacks only with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check.

**Strangling:** As a bonus action, a strangle weed can strangle one creature that was already grappled at the start of the strangle weeds turn. The strangle weed drags the grappled creature underwater and wraps `dice: 1d6` additional fronds around the target, which becomes grappled and restrained. The DC to escape from this grapple equals 10 plus 2 per frond restraining the creature. A restrained creature takes 6 (`dice: 1d8+2`) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns, and it can also be targeted by frond attacks. Strangling fronds have AC 10 and can be severed individually by 4 slashing damage each.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A strangle weed makes `dice: 1d4` melee attacks. The number of attacks is determined each round.

**Frond:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 20 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d6+2`) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled. Also see Strangling, above.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate and warm aquatic, underground aquatic

**Organization**: Solitary or patch (2–5)

## Description
Strangle weed is an extensive, floating plant that resembles a patch of seaweed. Strangle weed, however, is an ambush predator. It floats quietly and inconspicuously until prey wanders near, then lashes out with fronds to grapple foes and drag them into the water, where they are strangled and drowned.

This deadly plant thrives in warm and temperate bodies of water, and also in underground seas and pools.

A typical strangle weed is 10 feet in diameter, dark green, and slimy. Suspended beneath the central mass of seaweed are dozens of long, ropelike prehensile fronds up to 20 feet long.

Although strangle weed has no interest in treasure, coins and valuable items can sometimes be found among the bones and rotted gear of the plant’s victims that sink into the muck where creatures were killed. Strangle weed drifts on the current, however, so victims won’t necessarily be found at the plant’s current location. Finding this lost treasure might take many hours’ or days’ of underwater searching.
