# Trap #13 - "Water? What Water, I Don't See Any Water."
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> This trap is a little on the complicated side, but deliciously devious in the end. The room is "L" shaped, 50 feet along the outside of the "L", and 20 feet wide, to two 30 foot walls on the inner side of the "L". The ceiling is 10 feet high.
> 
> [[1 - The Entrance|The entrance]] is off to the left of the stem of the "L", on the base. Off to the right, down the stem of the "L" is ... yes another coffin! The walls are covered with the usual stucco, wonderful stuff, really, as you have seen it can hide a multitude of surprises. The magic users in the delvers party can sense no magic.
> 
> The party will eventually approach the coffin. As with the previous coffins, this one is stone, ornately carved with geometric patterns and 8 feet, by 4 feet, by 4 feet high. If the sarcophagus is opened it will set in motion the trap mechanism for this room. By now the party may have decided they don't want to open any sarcophagai they come upon because this brings them only problems. C' est la vie! The trap will also be activated by stepping on a pressure plate to the left of [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] at a point, on the floor in the center of the wall at the "toe" of the "L". In either event once tripped the nature of the room changes rapidly.
> 
> The first thing the party will notice is the sound of a terrific Crash as a 10 by 10 foot block of steel-plated stone drops down into the doorway. If the party left one of its number in [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] as a guard. or to keep the door open, there is a 30% chance he will be crushed (L3) survival based on Luck or Speed. This will effectively seal off the room.
> 
> The next thing the party will notice is that the room is descending into the ground. All that is, except a 20 by 20 foot alcove at the "toe" of the "L". Any that take the time to look into the sarcophagus will notice that it is full of silver ingots. (There are 58,000 s.p. weight of them. (About 5,800 g.p. value at the current rate of exchange.) A point to take note of at this time is that any reasonably agile character will have no trouble [[8 - Movement (D&D 5e SRD)|jumping]] into the alcove created by the dropping floor in the toe of the ''L''. but this will become increasingly difficult as the floor drops.
> 
> The floor will be dropping at a fair clip. In 5 seconds it will have dropped 40 feet, at which point it will lock in to place, and a trap door 20 feet wide and 10 feet deep, in the ceiling above the coffin will open. By now the room is well below the surface of the underground lake. (See main map) Hundreds of tons of [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|water]], and the denizens therein will pour into the chamber.
> 
> Now to [[3 - Weapons (D&D 5e SRD)|reach]] the alcove will require some pretty fancy footwork. There is a 70% chance of a successful attempt (L3) dependent on the character's resourcefulness. If a character is annored he must get free of the [[2 - Armor (D&D 5e SRD)|armor]] or this will lower the chances of success slightly (60% chance, (L4). (There ARE a few characters that have the requisite [[Strength (D&D 5e SRD)|strength]] to [[8 - Movement (D&D 5e SRD)|swim]] in heavy [[2 - Armor (D&D 5e SRD)|armor]], curses!) If the characters have some mechanism that allows them not to drown and thus they stay put and defy the [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|water]], there are denizens of the aforesaid lake that have to be dealt with as well. (See [[3 - Leftward Ho|Leftward Ho]] section for denizens of the [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|water]] list.)
> 
> For those who do make it to the alcove the show goes on. Those already safe will get to watch the struggles of those who have failed. The ones who think they are clever will be waiting for the [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|water]] level to get to the point they can clamber into the alcove. This will mean fending off the attentions of one or two of the lake dwellers just for sport. For these swimmers all is not as it seems. When the [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|water]] reaches a point 4 feet below the lip of the alcove it will set off another trap. A pin is released on a rocker panel in the floor of the alcove. As soon as the weight of a delver trying to [[8 - Movement (D&D 5e SRD)|climb]] out is put on the edge it will tip setting off the last part of the trap.
> 
> From the ceiling will descend, through the stucco, and from wall to wall a clear quartz panel. The edge of this panel will be razor sharp. ltS descent is not outrageously fast (Quartz being relatively fragile to drop it would risk breakage.) The character tripping the trap has a 90% chance to scramble into the alcove (L 1). Any others trying to enter the alcove will have 80% chances (L2). If they hesitate the chances will drop by 10% (1 level) per tum, until the wall drops into contact with the floor. (Delvers with severe judgement problems can elect to stay in the rising [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|water]] with no ADDITIONAL peril beside the risks already encountered.)
> 
> Compassionate delvers may wish to try breaking the quartz wall, but it will soon become apparent why this is not a survival oriented decision. The [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|water]] level rises past the edge of the alcove and will eventually afford those in the alcove with a wonderful floor to ceiling fish tank. This will come complete with views of their struggling friends, those in [[2 - Armor (D&D 5e SRD)|armor]], and those who either by luck or decision decided to chance the rising waters.
> 
> At this point there are two obvious weakness of this trap from My point of view. First the quartz wall doesn't leak. Too bad Evinrood really falls down here, nothing puts the edge on a victim like a time limit The other is less obvious but even more critical. Those still in the [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|water]] filled portion of the room could just try to [[8 - Movement (D&D 5e SRD)|swim]] out once the pressure equalizes. (There are still the lake dwellers but if the delvers last this long they probably aren't that concerned by the fish.)

## Setup

## Participants
> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> In this pleasant little tributary can be found:
> 
> **Pack Piranha**, hordes of ravenous little beasties that can strip an elf to his ear rings in seconds. (These creatures travel in large groups and should be considered VERY tough.) [[Swarm of Quippers (D&D 5e SRD)|Swarm of Quippers]]
> 
> **Albino Cave Sharks**, often over 8 feet long, a ghastly white in color, hunt by motion sensing, so if you fall into the water remain absolutely still and you will be just food ... er ... fine. (These creatures can be found in groups of 3 to 8 (`dice: 1D6+2`) and are individually Tough. If the odds are 3 or 4 to one even superhuman delvers will find themselves in dire straights.) [[Giant Electric Catfish]]
> 
> **Electro-Squids**, these cute little fellows pack a wollop that would do justice to a [[Lightning Bolt (D&D 5e SRD)|lightning bolt]]. Being small and relatively feeble they either grab hold of prey and zap it for food, or in the case of larger monsters which gulp them down whole, they zap them into unconsciousness, then nibble their way out! (These guys are not so Lough bul the "electro" can finish off the uninitiated by stunning them. If help is not forthcoming, drowning and lunch soon follow.) [[Gloom Crawler]]
> 
> **Blind Barricudas**, these creatures travel in schools and are famed for the length of their teeth and their healthy appetites. (Again a style of monster that travels in groups. Not as small or as hard to hit as Piranha or as big, mean and strong as the Sharks these critters can be beaten in combat.) [[Eel Hound (ToB)|Eel Hound]]
> 
> **Lastly there can be found the fiendish Crystal Sea Snakes**: they do not travel in large groups, and they are physically fragile. An average warrior can easily kill one in hand to hand combat. However during contact with one of these creatures there is a 40% chance (L4) of being bitten. They are lightning fast and their venom is deadly, and works almost instantaneously. (There is a substantial volume of thought that this is one of the few forms of poison more virulent than Dragon Venom! Capturing one of these creatures and milking it for venom would be an interesting commercial enterprise, if one were to survive the quick strike capabilities.)
> 
> Keep in mind most of the above creatures travel in groups. Add them liberally to spice up any member of the tomb robbing party's bracing dip in the underground river. [[Isonade (ToB)|Isonade]]
