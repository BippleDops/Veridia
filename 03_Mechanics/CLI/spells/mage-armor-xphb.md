![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/mage-armor.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of cured leather)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

You touch a willing creature who isn't wearing armor. Until the spell ends, the target's base AC becomes 13 plus its Dexterity modifier. The spell ends early if the target dons armor.
