Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Void Touch as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Void Touch. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Hidden Prophecy of Depths ## Plot Hooks - A journal reveals a betrayal about the government

- An heirloom has gone missing and evil awakens ## Related Notes - [[Similar Topic 1
