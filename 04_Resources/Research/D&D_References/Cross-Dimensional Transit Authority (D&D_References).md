This massive facility combines cutting-edge reality-manipulation technology with strict security protocols to ensure safe passage while preventing unauthorized crossings and dimensional contamination. Built at a naturally occurring convergence point where the realms' boundaries thin, the CDTA processes thousands of travelers daily while maintaining the delicate balance between accessibility and security. ### The Central Nexus **The Convergence Chamber**: A vast spherical hall where reality itself becomes malleable. Floating platforms provide staging areas for different types of crossings, while massive reality anchors maintain stable conditions. The chamber's walls shimmer with iridescent energy patterns that reflect the current dimensional stability. **The Oversight Galleries**: Enclosed observation decks where Authority staff monitor all transit operations. Advanced scrying arrays and dimensional sensors provide real-time information on crossing conditions, while emergency controls allow instant facility lockdown. **The Anchor Core**: Deep beneath the facility, reality anchor arrays extend into both realms. These crystalline structures pulse with synchronized energy, maintaining the artificial stability necessary for safe crossings. ### Security Sectors **Pre-Transit Screening**: Multi-level security checkpoints examining physical belongings, magical auras, dimensional resoce signatures, and mental state assessments. Each traveler receives a temporary harmonic identifier that tracks their journey. **Quarantine Bays**: Isolated chambers for travelers showing signs of dimensional contamination, reality sickness, or carrying potentially dangerous inter-realm materials. **Enforcement Barracks**: Fortified quarters for the Authority's security forces, including specialized units trained in dimensional pursuit and reality anchor combat. **Detention Complex**: High-security cells designed to hold individuals regardless of their dimensional origin, featuring pressure-adjustable environments and reality-dampening fields. ### Support Facilities **The Exchange**: A controlled marketplace where authorized traders conduct inter-realm commerce under strict supervision. All transactions are logged and taxed according to complex dual-jurisdiction agreements. **Medical Wing**: Fully equipped hospital with specialists in dimensional transition injuries, reality displacement syndrome, and cross-contamination treatment. **Diplomatic Suites**: Secure meeting rooms for inter-realm negotiations, featuring adjustable environmental controls and translation enchantments. **Transit Orientation Center**: Training facilities where first-time crossers learn safety protocols and cultural sensitivity guidelines. ### Standard Crossing Procedures **Phase 1: Initial Processing** (30-60 minutes)
