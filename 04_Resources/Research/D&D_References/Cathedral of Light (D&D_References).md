> The Cathedral serves as a moral anchor and safe haven in campaigns, providing healing, information, and sanctuary for characters. Use it to introduce religious themes, moral dilemmas, and opportunities for characters to help others. The mysteries and secrets provide ongoing plot threads, while the daily operations offer realistic downtime activities. ## Player-Facing Summary Cathedral of Light is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Cathedral of Light as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Cathedral of Light. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Cross-References - [[Cathedral of Light|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Cathedral Of Light riched: true -->
