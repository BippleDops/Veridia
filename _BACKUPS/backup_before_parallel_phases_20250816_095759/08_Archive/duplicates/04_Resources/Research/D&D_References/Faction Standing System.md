Practical, table-ready rules for Faction Standing System across Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. ## Player-Facing Summary Faction Standing System is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Faction Standing System as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Faction Standing System. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Covenant - Control trade routes ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Second Prophecy of Depths ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[Complete Pressure Adaptation System
