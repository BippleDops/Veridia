# Singing Stone (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a small metal chime)

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
You hum, sing, or play a short tune or recite a poem (one that can be sung in less than a minute) into a stone. Thereafter, whenever if the stone is sharply tapped or completely immersed in water, it plays the tune; if it remains immersed, it will repeat it every ten minutes.

The stone will capture music from no one other than yourself.
