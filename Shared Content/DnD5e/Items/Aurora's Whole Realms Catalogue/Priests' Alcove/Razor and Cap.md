## Description
Among the most recognizable marks of many priesthoods is the shaving of one’s crown. Sadly, adventuring or cloistered priests must shave their own pates and thus end up with oblong or star-shaped patterns. Our razor and cap set solves this problem. The sturdy leather cap, fashioned in Ordulin, fits any size head by using the numerous buttons along the front. Whatever the size, the cap creates a perfect circle for shaving. The accompanying razor is made of the finest steel and folds neatly into a leather case. (4 gp)
