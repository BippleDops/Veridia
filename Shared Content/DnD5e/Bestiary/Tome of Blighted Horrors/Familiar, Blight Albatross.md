Sometimes known as a gooey bird or a muckmawk, the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] albatross is common along the shores of the sea around the city of Castorhage. They gained these nicknames for the feeding technique of the bird, where they dive into the muck-laden waters and emerge with fish and feathers coated with the filmy sludge that covers the Lyme River on most days.

The [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] albatross’s diet is predominantly fish, crustaceans, and offal, although they also scavenge carrion when necessary. Due to the nature of the pollution found in the river and its inhabitants, the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] albatross has developed considerable resistance to diseases and poisons. The folk of Castorhage are reluctant to kill one of these birds, for it is considered bad luck. Those that have slain one of these creatures soon finds the legends are very true, and for a period of time find their luck changed for the worse.

The adult plumage of most of the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] albatrosses is usually some variation of dark upper-wing and back with white undersides. A [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] albatross stands 3 feet tall with a wingspan of up to 12 feet and weighs 20 pounds.
