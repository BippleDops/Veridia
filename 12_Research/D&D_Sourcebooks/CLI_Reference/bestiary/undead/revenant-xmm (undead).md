Revets possess the bodies they had in life, using them to hunt down their killers. If their bodies are destroyed, they take control of new bodies that gradually change to resemble the revets' original forms.

Wrathful spirits bent on revenge, revets possess corpses and other materials, using them to seek justice or vent their rage on those who wronged them. Revets refuse to rest until those they seek to punish are no more. If their bodies are destroyed, revets claim new forms and continue their ruthless quests.
