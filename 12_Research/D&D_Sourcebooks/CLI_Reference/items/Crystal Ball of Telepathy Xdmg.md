# Crystal Ball of Telepathy
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  


- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

While touching this crystal orb, you can cast [[scrying-xphb|Scrying]] (save DC 17) with it. In addition, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also cast [[suggestion-xphb|Suggestion]] (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this [[suggestion-xphb|Suggestion]] to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if [[scrying-xphb|Scrying]] ends. You can't cast [[suggestion-xphb|Suggestion]] in this way again until the next dawn.
