    "description": "Lysander Crystalborn stands as living testament to the power of pure bloodlines in Aethermoor. Tall and imposing at 6'3\", his human heritage has been refined over generations of selective breeding with celestial-touched beings and exposure to the purest crystal magic. His golden hair seems to contain flecks of actual crystal that catch and refract light, and his blue eyes glow with inherited divine power.\n\nMost remarkably, intricate crystalline patterns run beneath his skin like luminous veins, pulsing with the combined magical essence of his entire bloodline. These patterns become more pronounced when he channels ancestral power, sometimes forming runic script that tells the stories of his forebears.\n\nLysander wears ceremonial plate armor forged from blessed metals and inscribed with the names and deeds of every notable ancestor in his line. The armor itself has been passed down for twelve generations, growing stronger with each bearer's accomplishments.\n\nHe maintains the Bloodline Sanctum, a crystal cathedral where the spirits of his ancestors dwell in crystalline statues that can speak and offer guidance. This sacred space serves both as a family shrine and a meeting place for others who carry significant magical bloodlines.",
