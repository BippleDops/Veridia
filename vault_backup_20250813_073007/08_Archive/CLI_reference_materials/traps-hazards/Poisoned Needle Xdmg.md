# Poisoned Needle
*Generic Hazard*  

A poisoned needle is hidden in a lock. When a creature opens the lock with any object other than the proper key, the needle springs out and stabs the creature. The creature makes a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (`d10`) Poison damage and has the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition for 1 hour. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage only.

## Avoid

The trap doesn't trigger if the lock is opened using a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/knock-xphb|Knock]] spell or similar magic.

## Detect and Disarm

As a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Search|Search]] action, a creature can examine the trapped lock and make a DC 15 Wisdom ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Perception|Perception]]) check, detecting the needle on a successful check. Once the trap is detected, a character can take an action to try to disarm the trap, doing so with a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Sleight%20of%20Hand|Sleight of Hand]]) check. On a failed check, the creature triggers the trap.

## At Higher Levels

You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing the damage and the save DC, as shown in the following table.

| Levels | Poison Damage | Save DC |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| 5–10 | 11 (`2d10`) | 13 |
| 11–16 | 22 (`4d10`) | 15 |
| 17–20 | 55 (`10d10`) | 17 |
