A haunted legislative chamber beneath the current Parliament building where the spirits of Aquabyssos's first democratic representatives continue their debates. This forgotten room was sealed after a catastrophic political scandal, but the supernatural echoes of ancient political arguments still resonate. The chamber exists in a state of temporal suspension, where ghostly parliamentarians endlessly re-enact their final, fateful session. ## History

Two centuries ago, before the current monarchy, governed Aquabyssos a democratically elected Parliament. A massive corruption scandal involving foreign influence and criminal cartels led to the government's collapse and the chamber's abandonment. The traumatic end to democracy left such a psychic impression that the spirits of the parliamentarians remain trapped, forever debating the crisis that destroyed their system. ## The Spectral Session

**Ongoing Debate**: The spirits endlessly argue about their final legislation
**Key Figures**: Ghostly Speaker, opposition leaders, and reform advocates
**Supernatural Effects**: Temporal echoes replay historical moments
**Communication**: Spirits can interact with living visitors under certain conditions
**Resolution**: The debate cannot end until historical justice is achieved ## Notable Spirits

**Speaker Cornelius Deepwater**: Still trying to maintain order
**Representative Sarah Justice**: Reform advocate who exposed the corruption
**Lord Marcus Goldcurrent**: Corrupt official whose crimes destroyed democracy
**The Foreign Agent**: Mysterious figure who orchestrated the scandal
**Common Citizens**: Gallery ghosts who died defending democracy ## Accessing the Chamber

**Official Routes**: Require highest security clearance
**Secret Passages**: Hidden entrances through palace basements
**Supernatural Methods**: Some spirits can guide living visitors
**Emergency Access**: Maintece tunnels during certain conditions
**Restricted Times**: Chamber is most active during significant political events ## The Unresolved Crisis

The spirits cannot rest until their final legislation is properly addressed:
- Anti-corruption measures that were never implemented
- Foreign influence investigations left incomplete
- Democratic reforms that died with the government
- Justice for those who died defending the parliament
- Acknowledgment of the truth about the government's fall ## Adventure Hooks
