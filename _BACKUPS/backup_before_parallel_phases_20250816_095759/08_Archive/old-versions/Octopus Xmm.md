Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of octopus xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around octopus xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The First Prophecy of Depths ## Plot Hooks - A map reveals ancient history about the government

- Someone is blackmailing an heir for power
- Strange disappearances suggest a curse
