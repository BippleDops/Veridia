## Description
A rigid wire and leather wristband straps this cane to the wrist, allowing a pick-pocket to feign infirmity until close enough to strike. Then by bumping into the [[Archery Target|target]], the cane-bearing hand can perform the pilfery and return to the cane before it is noticed. The wired caneâ€™s handle contains a long-bored hole sized for coins of most types and most jewels. Ivory (10 gp); Bronze (5 gp); Oak (3 gp).
