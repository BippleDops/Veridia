# Storm Caller Druid - Character Build

## Overview
The Storm Caller Druid represents the primal connection between [[Aethermoor]] and the elemental forces of air, storm, and sky. These druids have learned to channel the raw power of tempests, commanding wind and lightning to protect the aerial realms and maintain the balance between civilization and the wild fury of storms.
