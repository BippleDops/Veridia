## Description

This [[2 - Casting a Spell|cube]] is about an inch across. Each face has a distinct marking on it that can be pressed. The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains `dice: 1d20` (1d20) expended charges daily at dawn.

You can use an action to press one of the [[2 - Casting a Spell|cube]]’s faces, expending a number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of [[Invisible|invisible]] force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the cube’s sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier’s effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.

If your [[8 - Movement|movement]] causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can’t pass through the [[2 - Casting a Spell|cube]], you can’t move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.
