# Ballant's Stonestrength (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a small granite wedge and a pinch of powdered iron)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You provide magical strength to a stone structure by providing it with temporary hit points equal to its regular hit points.

Optionally, this completely heals any stone-based creature, such as a gargoyle or a stone golem, or can be used to repair any damaged stone object (that has lost no more than 3/4 of its hit points), such as a wall or statue.
