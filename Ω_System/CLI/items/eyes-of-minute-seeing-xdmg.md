# Eyes of Minute Seeing
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  



These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, your vision improves significantly out to a range of 1 foot, granting you [Darkvision](/03_Mechanics/CLI/senses.md#Darkvision) within that range and [Advantage](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Intelligence ([Investigation](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Investigation)) checks made to examine something within that range.
