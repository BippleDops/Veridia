# Welcome to Aquabyssos
## A Player's Guide to the Parliament of Shadows

*You've been selected as diplomatic envoys to the underwater realm of Aquabyssos. What should be a simple diplomatic mission to establish trade relations will become something far more complex...*

---

## What You Know About Aquabyssos

### The Drowning
Three hundred years ago, a magical catastrophe called the "Cascade of Sorrows" drowned the great empire of Thalassopolis and surrounding civilizations. The survivors adapted to life underwater through magical and biological means. An entire civilization now thrives beneath the waves.

### Getting There
Your journey begins at one of the Transition Pools—ancient magical gateways that allow surface dwellers to safely descend. You'll be provided with pressure suits and breathing apparatus. The descent takes approximately 4 hours.

### The Government
Aquabyssos is governed by the Parliament of Echoes, where representatives from seven underwater continents debate and vote on laws. It's said to be a democracy, though rumors suggest things are more complex below the surface.

## Common Knowledge

### Sorrow Pearls
The currency of Aquabyssos, created from crystallized tears. Exchange rate: 1 gold = 2 Sorrow Pearls. They glow faintly and are always slightly warm.

### Depth Adaptation
Prolonged exposure to the depths causes physical changes. Most inhabitants have developed gills, scales, or other adaptations. This is considered normal and often necessary for survival.

### Shadows Behave Strangely
You've heard odd rumors that shadows in Aquabyssos sometimes move independently of their owners. Most dismiss this as superstition or tricks of the underwater light.

### The Seven Continents
1. **Abyssos Prime** - Political center where you're headed
2. **Nereidios** - Center of learning and magic
3. **Corallion** - The living city that grows and changes
4. **Tenebrarum** - The shadow markets and dark depths
5. **Crystallium** - Frozen depths where time moves strangely
6. **The Mourning Depths** - Where sorrow itself has weight
7. **Others** - Several regions remain unmapped

### Transportation
- **Blood Current Express**: Fast transport through massive creature veins
- **Depth Swimmers**: Guided tours via adapted guides
- **Pressure Tubes**: Rapid but disorienting travel
- **Walking Paths**: Safe routes marked with bioluminescent guides

## Cultural Etiquette

### Greetings
- Touch foreheads while exhaling bubbles (sign of sharing breath)
- Never grab someone's shadow
- Depth of bow indicates respect (deeper = more respect)

### Taboos
- **Never** mention "drowning" as death - use "returning to depth"
- Don't comment on physical adaptations unless complimented first
- Avoid bright lights without warning (painful to adapted eyes)
- Don't refuse offered food (it's scarce and valuable)

### Common Phrases
- *"May your shadows swim freely"* - A blessing
- *"Deep and deeper still"* - Agreement or acceptance
- *"The pressure knows"* - Equivalent to "time will tell"
- *"Breathe easy"* - Goodbye/good luck
- *"Surface thoughts"* - Shallow or silly ideas
