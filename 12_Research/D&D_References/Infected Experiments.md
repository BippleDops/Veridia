## Summary
Infected Experiments describes a turning current in history where choices about memory, depth, and sovereignty reshaped travel, trade, and ritual.

Infected Experiments is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.
