## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting.*** The deathlock's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At Will: *detect magic, disguise self, mage armor*

***Spellcasting.*** The deathlock is a 5th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma. It regains its expended spell slots when it finishes a short or long rest. It knows the following warlock spells:

Cantrips: *chill touch, eldritch blast, mage hand*
3rd level (2 slots): *arms of Hadar, 2, arms of Hadar, dispel magic, hold person, hunger of Hadar, invisibility, spider climb*

***Turn Resistance.*** The deathlock has advantage on saving throws against any effect that turns undead.

## Actions
***Deathly Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 ( `dice: 2d6+2`) necrotic damage.

## Description
The forging of a pact between a warlock and a patron is no minor occasionâ€”at least not for the warlock. The consequences of breaking that pact can be dire and, in some cases, lethal. A warlock who fails to live up to a bargain with an evil patron runs the risk of rising from the dead as a deathlock, a foul undead driven to serve its otherworldly patron from beyond the grave.

An extraordinarily powerful necromancer might also discover the dark methods of creating a deathlock and then bind it to service, acting in this respect as the deathlock's patron.

***Obedient and Obsessed.*** An overpowering urge to serve consumes the mind of a newly awakened deathlock. All goals and ambitions it had in life that don't please its patron fall away as its master's desires become the purpose that drives the deathlock. The creature immediately resumes work on its patron's behalf. Accomplishing a difficult goal might mean the deathlock is forced to serve another powerful creature or might entail in gathering servants of its own.

Whatever the goal, it always reflects the patron's interests, ranging from small-scale concerns to matters of cosmic scope. A deathlock in the thrall of a fiend might work to destroy a specific temple dedicated to a good god, while one that serves a Great Old One could be charged with hunting for the materials needed to call forth a horrifying entity into the world.

***Undead Nature.*** A deathlock doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

## Patron-Specific Spells
