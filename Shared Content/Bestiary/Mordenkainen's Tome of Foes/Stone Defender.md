## Special Traits
***False Appearance.*** While the stone defender remains motionless against an uneven earthen or stone surface, it is indistinguishable from that surface.

***Magic Resistance.*** The stone defender has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions
***Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ( `dice: 2d6+4`) bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, it is knocked prone.

## Reactions
***Intercept Attack.*** In response to another creature within 5 feet of it being hit by an attack roll, the stone defender gives that creature a +5 bonus to its AC against that attack, potentially causing a miss. To use this ability, the stone defender must be able to see the creature and the attacker.

## Description
Thick plates of stone riveted onto a stone defender give it substantial protection and allow it to conceal itself against a stony surface. Its chief role isn't as an ambusher, however, but as a bodyguard for gnomes and other clockworks.
