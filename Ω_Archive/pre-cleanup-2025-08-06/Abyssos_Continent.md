# Abyssos - The Sunken Continent

## Overview
Once a thriving surface empire, Abyssos was pulled beneath the waves a millennium ago by a catastrophic magical event known as the Great Submersion. Now it exists as a vast underwater realm where air-breathing and aquatic races have learned to coexist through powerful magic and ancient technology.

## The Great Submersion
A thousand years ago, the surface empire of Abyssos attempted to harness the power of an ancient aboleth artifact. The ritual went catastrophically wrong, pulling the entire continent 2,000 fathoms beneath the ocean's surface. However, rather than drowning, the continent was encased in a massive bubble of breathable water - a unique magical substance that allows both air-breathers and water-breathers to survive.

## Geography

### The Three Depths
Abyssos is divided into three distinct vertical regions:

#### The Shallows (0-500 fathoms)
- **Light Level:** Dim sunlight filters through
- **Inhabitants:** Surface races, adapted merfolk, traders
- **Major City:** [[Lumenos, the Crystal Capital]]
- **Characteristics:** Coral cities, kelp forests, relatively safe

#### The Twilight Zone (500-1,500 fathoms)
- **Light Level:** Perpetual twilight, bioluminescent life
- **Inhabitants:** Deep merfolk, sahuagin, mysterious entities
- **Major Location:** [[The Twilight Trenches]]
- **Characteristics:** Ancient ruins, pressure challenges, increasing danger

#### The Abyss (1,500+ fathoms)
- **Light Level:** Total darkness except for magic/bioluminescence
- **Inhabitants:** Aboleths, krakens, eldritch horrors
- **Major Location:** [[The Abyssal Throne]]
- **Characteristics:** Extreme pressure, ancient evils, forbidden knowledge

### The Breathable Water
The continent is surrounded by "Aqua Vitae" - magically altered water that:
- Can be breathed by both air and water creatures
- Maintains comfortable pressure regardless of depth
- Glows faintly blue-green
- Slowly converts normal water at its borders

## Major Settlements

### Capital Cities
1. **[[Lumenos, the Crystal Capital]]** - Seat of the Tidal Parliament
2. **[[Pearlhaven]]** - Major trade hub
3. **[[The Sunken Library of Tethys]]** - Center of knowledge

### Notable Locations

- **[[Kraken's Rest]]** - Dangerous pirate haven
- **[[The Brine Wastes]]** - Desolate salt plains
- **[[The Twilight Trenches]]** - Mysterious canyons
- **[[The Abyssal Throne]]** - Seat of ancient power

## Political Structure

### The Tidal Parliament
A democratic council with representatives from each depth zone:
- **Surface Speakers:** Represent adapted surface races
- **Depth Wardens:** Represent native aquatic races
- **Pressure Prophets:** Represent the deep dwellers

### Major Factions
- **[[The Tidal Parliament]]** - Current government
- **[[The Restoration Coalition]]** - Seeks to raise Abyssos
- **[[The Deep Ones' Covenant]]** - Embraces the depths

- **Pressure Glass:** Incredibly strong building material
- **Kelp Silk:** Versatile textile
- **Deep Iron:** Metal that never rusts

### Trade Routes
- **The Rising Current:** Connects to surface world through magical portals
- **The Spiral Road:** Descends through all three zones
- **The Lateral Stream:** Circles the continent horizontally

## Magic & Technology

### Unique Magical Properties
- **Pressure Magic:** New school developed post-submersion
- **Bioluminescent Enchantments:** Living light sources
- **Tidal Binding:** Contracts enforced by ocean currents
- **Depth Sight:** Ability to see in absolute darkness

### Ancient Technologies
- **Pressure Locks:** Allow travel between depths
- **Coral Computers:** Living structures that store information
- **Current Generators:** Harness tidal forces for power
- **Bubble Forges:** Create air pockets for traditional crafting

## Threats & Dangers

### Environmental Hazards
- **Pressure Storms:** Sudden dangerous pressure changes
- **The Eternal Maelstrom:** Massive whirlpool at continent's center
- **Depth Madness:** Psychological effects of extreme depths
- **Brine Rivers:** Toxic underwater rivers

### Hostile Forces
- **[[The Drowned Emperor]]** - Undead former ruler
- **Aboleth Mindlords** - Ancient psychic tyrants
- **Kraken Spawn** - Tentacled monstrosities
- **Pressure Pirates** - Raiders of the depths

## Current Events

### The Current Convergence
Every 50 years, all ocean currents around Abyssos align, creating:
- Temporary portals to the surface
- Increased magical activity
- Migration of deep sea monsters
- Political upheaval

The next convergence is happening NOW, offering opportunities for:
- Surface world contact
- Ancient artifact discovery
- Political revolution
- Catastrophic threats

## Adventure Hooks

### Immediate Concerns
1. **[[The Lost Expedition]]** - Surface explorers trapped in the depths
2. **[[The Pressure Conspiracy]]** - Plot to destroy the Aqua Vitae
3. **[[The Leviathan Awakens]]** - Ancient creature stirring
4. **[[The Surface Emissary]]** - Diplomatic mission from above

### Long-term Campaigns
- Restore Abyssos to the surface
- Prevent complete submersion to the ocean floor
- Unite the three depth zones
- Discover the truth behind the Great Submersion

## Notable NPCs
- **[[Admiral Coral Wavecrest]]** - Leader of the Tidal Parliament
- **[[The Pearl Empress]]** - Mysterious merchant queen
- **[[Captain Barnacle Blackheart]]** - Infamous pirate
- **[[Sage Tethys the Deep-Minded]]** - Keeper of forbidden knowledge
- **[[Druid Myr'thanis]]** - Guardian of the coral gardens

## Session Zero Questions
1. How did you come to be in Abyssos?
2. Can you naturally breathe underwater, or do you rely on magic?
3. Which depth zone are you most comfortable in?
4. What is your relationship with the surface world?
5. How has the submersion affected your race/culture?

## DM Notes
- The Great Submersion was actually intentional by the aboleth
- The Drowned Emperor still rules from the Abyssal Throne
- The Current Convergence could either save or doom Abyssos
- Each depth zone has its own time flow (deeper = slower)
- The Aqua Vitae is slowly failing at the borders
