## Description
Stone guardians are sometimes referred to as lesser stone golems. They are similar to stone golems, but are smaller and considerably less powerful. Like most golems, their chief function is to serve as guardians for their creators.

When a stone guardian is constructed, its creator must also craft a corresponding magical ring. The golem always knows where the ring is, and it won’t attack anyone who wears the ring or who is within 10 feet of the person wearing it. It takes commands only from the person wearing the ring. This feature makes stone guardians much easier to transfer from one master to another than any other type of golem. A stone guardian is 6 feet tall and resembles a stocky humanoid covered in mud and gravel. Where a human’s heart would be, the stone guardian golem has a fistsized, round stone that faintly glows and pulses.

A stone guardian’s body is constructed from mud and small stones mixed with rare herbs and powders. A large chunk of stone inserted into the chest cavity functions as its “heart.” The magical ring that links a stone guardian is constructed at the same time.

## Additional Details
