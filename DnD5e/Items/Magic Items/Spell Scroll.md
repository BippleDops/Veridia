# Spell Scroll

## Overview

**Type**: Magic Item

**Group**: *Scrolls, varies*

## Description

A spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without providing any material components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and it crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll is not lost.

If the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your [[7 - Spellcasting|spellcasting]] ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.

Once the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell’s saving throw [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] and [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] bonus, as well as the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.

A [[wizard]] spell on a *spell scroll* can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a *spell scroll*, the copier must succeed on an [[Intelligence]] ([[Intelligence|Arcana]]) check with a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] equal to 10 + the spell’s level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the *spell scroll* is destroyed.
