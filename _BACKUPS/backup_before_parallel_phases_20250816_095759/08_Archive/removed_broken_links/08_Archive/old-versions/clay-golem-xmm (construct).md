The materials used in creating clay golems originate from near the location the golems protect and often have special significance to their creators, such as clay from a holy site or bricks from a magical ruin. While some clay golems are masterfully sculpted to resemble living beings, others have only vaguely humanlike forms. These golems obey their creators' orders and protect what their makers value most. Some still follow these orders long after their creators' deaths. Roll on or choose a result from the Clay Golem Orders table to inspire the commands a clay golem follows. **Clay Golem Orders**`dice: [](clay-golem-xmm.md#^clay-golem-orders)`| dice: `dice: 1d4` | The Clay Golem Follows Orders To... |

|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| 1 | Block the path of anyone who enters a site with a weapon drawn. |
| 2 | Defend any member of their creator's family or community who is threatened in its sight. |
| 3 | Prevent any Fiend from crossing a bridge. |
| 4 | Remove any who enter its creator's workshop. |

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of clay golem xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around clay golem xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A prisoner has gone missing and evil awakens
