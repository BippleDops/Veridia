The Deepwater Trading Consortium dominates maritime trade across the known world, controlling shipping routes, deep-sea mining operations, and cultural exchange between surface and underwater civilizations. Led by **Guildmaster Admiral Tidal Goldwave**, they maintain the largest merchant marine fleet and negotiate treaties with aquatic kingdoms. ## Player-Facing Summary The Deepwater Trading Consortium is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Deepwater Trading Consortium as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around The Deepwater Trading Consortium. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Strange sightings suggest a curse
