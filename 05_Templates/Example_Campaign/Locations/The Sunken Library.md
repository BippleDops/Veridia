# The Sunken Library

## General Info
**Location**: [[02_Worldbuilding/Atlas/The Whispering Peaks]]

## Description

## GM Notes
- The library is a dangerous and difficult place to explore.
- The library is a good place to find rare and powerful magical knowledge.
- The Order of the Azure Flame is actively trying to destroy the library and its contents.
