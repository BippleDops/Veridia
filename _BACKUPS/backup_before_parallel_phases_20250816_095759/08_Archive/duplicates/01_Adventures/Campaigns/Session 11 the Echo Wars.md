- NPCs from throughout campaign appear in echo forms **Future Implications**:
- Heroes now have access to echo dimension resources
- Echo versions of NPCs can provide alternate perspectives
- Reality manipulation becomes more complex but more powerful ### Adaptation Guidelines **For Different Outcomes**: - If heroes reject integration: Ongoing echo war requiring military solution
- If heroes choose one echo: Become that reality, others still hostile
- If partial integration: Some echoes remain independent allies/enemies
- If complete integration: Heroes transcend dimensional limitations ### Echo Dimension Adventure Hooks **Ongoing Possibilities**: - Exploration adventures in different echo realities
- Rescue missions to save people trapped between dimensions
- Diplomatic missions to resolve inter-dimensional conflicts
- Research expeditions to understand cosmic mechanics
- Training exercises using echo dimension scenarios #### Echo Encounter Types`dice: `dice: `dice: 1d12```| d12 | Encounter | | status: active
