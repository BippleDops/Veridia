## Special Traits
***Death Burst.*** The gas spore explodes when it drops to 0 hit points. Each creature within 20 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (`dice: 3d6`) poison damage and become infected with a disease on a failed save. Creatures immune to the poisoned condition are immune to this disease.

Spores invade an infected creature's system, killing the creature in a number of hours equal to `dice: 1d12`+the creature's Constitution score, unless the disease is removed. In half that time, the creature becomes poisoned for the rest of the duration. After the creature dies, it sprouts `dice: 2d4` Tiny gas spores that grow to full size in 7 days.

***Eerie Resemblance.*** The gas spore resembles a [[Beholder|beholder]]. A creature that can see the gas spore can discern its true nature with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check.

## Actions
***Touch.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +0 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 1 poison damage, and the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or become infected with the disease described in the Death Burst trait.

## Description
The first gas spores are thought to have been spawned from dead [[Beholder|beholders]], whose moldering corpses fed a parasitic fungus with aberrant magic. Having long since adapted into a unique plant creature, a gas spore grows quickly and purposefully out of any corpse, creating a malevolent-looking mockery of the most feared denizen of the Underdark.
