--- # Continental Connections Map *"Every current flows somewhere - follow the connections to see the whole."* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

The Continental Connections Map is a comprehensive cartographic representation showing the physical, magical, and political connections between different continental regions across both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. This map reveals how underwater current systems link to surface geography, creating a unified view of inter-realm geography that traditional single-realm maps cannot provide. ### Duration

Requires regular updates as political boundaries and magical phenomena change. ## Adventure Hooks

1. **Map Update**: Survey expedition to chart new connections
2. **Hidden Route**: Discovery of secret connection not on official maps
3. Subsequently, **Cartographic Espionage**: Steal or protect classified map sections ## Campaign Use

Provides visual aid for world-building and serves as reference for planning inter-realm travel and adventures. ## Player-Facing Summary Continental Connections Map is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Continental Connections Map as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Continental Connections Map. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A letter reveals a betrayal about a local noble
