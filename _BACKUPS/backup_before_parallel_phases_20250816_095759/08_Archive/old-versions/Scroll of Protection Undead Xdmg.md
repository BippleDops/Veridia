--- # Scroll of Protection (Undead)

*Scroll, rare* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/scroll-of-protection.webp#right) Using a [[actions#Magic|Magic action to read the scroll creates a 5-foot [Area of Effect Xphb]] originating from you. For 5 minutes,  can't enter or affect anything in the area. However, if you move in such a way that an Undead would be inside the area, the effect ends. As a [[actions#Magic|Magic action, a creature within 5 feet of the [Area of Effect Xphb]] can attempt to overcome it, which forces the creature to make a **DC 15** Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the creature ceases to be affected by the [[Area of Effect Xphb. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 302* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Scroll of protection undead xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
