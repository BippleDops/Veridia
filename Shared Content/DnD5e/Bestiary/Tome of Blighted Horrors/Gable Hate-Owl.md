![[sb21ut2r.uqs.png|Gable Hate-Owl|300]]
[[sb21ut2r.uqs.png|open outside]]

*This sinister-looking owl has pitch-black plumage and a pallid face with yellow eyes. The V-shaped pattern of feathers on its brow gives the appearance of a perpetual scowl of utter scorn.*

**Alignment**: Neutral Evil

**Initiative**: +2

**Armor Class**: 12

**Hit Points**: 14 (`dice: 4d6`)

**Speed**: 10 ft., fly 60 ft.

**Challenge**: CR 1/2

**Experience**: 100 XP

## Other Details
**Ability Scores**: Str 5 (-3), Dex 15 (+2), Con 10 (+0), Int 3 (-4), Wis 15 (+2), Cha 16 (+3)

**Skills**: Perception +4, Stealth +4

**Senses**: Darkvision 60 ft.

**Languages**: None

**Size**: Small

**Type**: Monstrosity

## Special Traits
**Flurry of Wings:** If the hate-owl’s bite and claws attacks both hit the same target on the hate-owl’s turn, the target takes an additional `dice: 1d8 + 2` bludgeoning damage.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The hate-owl bites once and attacks once with its claws.

**Melee Attack—Bite:** +4 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d4 + 2` piercing damage.

**Melee Attack—Claws:** +4 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d6 + 2` slashing damage.

**Gaze Attack—Spiteful Glare:** A creature within 60 feet that can see the gable hate-owl’s eyes must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. If it fails, the creature drops one item it’s holding (roll randomly if more than one item is held) and has tactical disadvantage on attacks, ability checks, and saving throws until the end of its next turn, and the hate-owl can immediately move up to 60 feet (if it hasn’t moved yet) and use Multiattack against the creature.

## Description
**Environment**: Urban (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary

The gable hate-owl is a shadow among the homes and buildings in the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]]. Viewed as a thing of ill omen, the presence of the owl roosting is feared by the common man. Spiteful, petty birds, the gable hate-owl got its name from the hateful scowl its natural plumage creates. They have been known to kill or torture for sport, attacking dogs and other small animals as they flense off flesh and fur and then leave the poor victims to limp away.

These great owls are large, although most of their bulk comes from fluffy feathers and large heads, with plumage that gives that appearance of wearing a high-collared cloak. Great horned owls have wingspans of up to 5 feet and weigh up to 4 pounds. Gable hate-owls primarily hunt at night, locating prey through their excellent hearing and sight. Their diet consists of rodents supplemented by smaller birds and rabbits.

Their gaze particularly unsettles the folk of the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]], as the piercing black eyes that seem dead peer out from under the sharp contrasting pale facial feathers. This sinister-looking visage creates ill fate to any that the owl wishes, typically casting its hateful look upon those that startle or interrupt the bird. A gable hate-owl’s wickedly sharp beak lets it easily rip open hard shells or strip the flesh from its meals.
