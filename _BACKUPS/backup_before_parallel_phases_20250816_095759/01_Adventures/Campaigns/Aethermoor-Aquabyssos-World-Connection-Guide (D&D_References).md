- Progress vs Tradition
- Known vs Unknown > *"In the space between worlds, all possibilities exist simultaneously. The question isn't which world survives, but what new world emerges from their collision."* --- ## Player-Facing Summary Aethermoor Aquabyssos World Connection Guide is a sky-borne element of the setting, known for brass fittings and cloudstone terraces.
