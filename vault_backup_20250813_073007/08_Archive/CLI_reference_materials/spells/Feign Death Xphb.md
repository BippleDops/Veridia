# Feign Death
*3rd-level, Necromancy (ritual)*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of graveyard dirt)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a willing creature and put it into a cataleptic state that is indistinguishable from death.

For the duration, the target appears dead to outward inspection and to spells used to determine the target's status. The target has the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Blinded|Blinded]] and [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] conditions, and its [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb|Speed]] is 0.

The target also has [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/resistance-xphb|Resistance]] to all damage except Psychic damage, and it has [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/immunity-xphb|Immunity]] to the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition.
