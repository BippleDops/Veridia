## The Amber Shard - His Greatest Secret
### Hidden Power Source
Deep beneath the Monastery of Eternal Light, Maltheos has secretly constructed a containment chamber for the Amber Shard - one of [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]]. This discovery has shaped his entire crusade.

### How He Acquired It
- Found the Shard 15 years ago during excavation of monastery foundations
- Initial contact caused visions of the original Shattering
- Learned his ancestor Marcus the Just was involved in the crown's destruction
- Decided to keep the Shard secret while studying its properties

### Effects on His Crusade
- The Shard's presence amplifies his divine powers significantly
- Provides him with prophetic visions about crystal corruption
- Confirms his belief that all Shards must be destroyed to save the world
- Creates internal conflict as the Shard's power could corrupt him too

### The Containment Protocol
- Shard is housed in pre-Shattering containment apparatus
- Protected by layers of holy wards and guardian constructs
- Only Maltheos knows the access codes and procedures
- Plans to destroy it once all other Shards are located

## The Purist Coalition - Military Structure

- 2,000 trained soldiers dedicated to anti-crystal warfare

### Phase Three: The New Order

### The Foreign Invasion Pact
> [!warning] DM Only
> Maltheos has secretly negotiated with foreign military forces who fear crystal technology. In exchange for supporting his purification campaign, they will receive territorial concessions and trade advantages. He views this as temporary alliance of convenience.

## Psychological Profile - The Burden of Legacy
### The Ancestral Guilt Complex
Maltheos's discovery of his ancestor's role in the Shattering created a profound psychological crisis that drives all his actions.

### Core Psychological Drivers
- **Compensation**: Must prove his family line serves good, not evil
- **Projection**: Transfers his ancestor's guilt onto all crystal users
- **Grandiosity**: Believes only he can save the world from corruption
- **Persecution Complex**: Views opposition as persecution of the righteous
- **Messianic Delusion**: Convinced he is divinely chosen for this mission

### Internal Contradictions
- Uses Shard power while condemning all Shards as evil
- Employs violence while preaching peace and healing
- Demands absolute truth while living fundamental lies
- Claims to serve the people while planning to rule them

### Moments of Doubt
- Late night sessions staring at the Amber Shard wondering if he's wrong
- Brief moments of seeing the fear in his followers' eyes
- Dreams where his ancestor Marcus asks if this is really justice
