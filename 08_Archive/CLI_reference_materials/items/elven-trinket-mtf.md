# Elven Trinket
*Adventuring gear*  



`dice: [](elven-trinket-mtf.md#^trinket)`

| dice: d8 | Trinket |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A small notebook that causes anything written in it to disappear after 1 hour |
| 2 | A crystal lens made of ivory and gold that causes anything observed through it to appear to be surrounded by motes of multicolored light |
| 3 | A small golden pyramid inscribed with elven symbols and about the size of a walnut |
| 4 | A cloak pin made from enamel in the shape of a butterfly; when you take the pin off, it turns into a real butterfly, and returns when you are ready to put your cloak back on again |
| 5 | A golden compass that points toward the nearest portal to the Feywild within 10 miles |
| 6 | A small silver spinning top that, when spun, endlessly spins until interrupted |
| 7 | A small songbird made of enamel, gold wire, and precious stone; uttering the songbird's name in Elvish causes the trinket to emit that bird's birdsong |
| 8 | A small enamel flower that, when put in one's hair, animates, tying back the wearer's hair with a living vine with flowers; plucking a single flower from this vine returns it to its inanimate form |
