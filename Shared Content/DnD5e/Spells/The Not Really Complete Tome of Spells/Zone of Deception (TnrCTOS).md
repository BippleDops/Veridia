# Zone of Deception (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: 2*nd-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 10 minutes You create a magical zone that guards against the truth in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak the truth while in the radius. You know whether each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw.


## Effects
An affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it doesn’t want to lie. Such a creature can hint at the truth as long as the bulk of its statement is a lie.
