- Links to surface campaign through [Market District|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Market District]]
- Gateway to deeper Aquathys adventures
- Syndicate connections span both worlds
- Diplomatic intrigue affects all levels --- *"In Pearl Harbor, everyone's swimming in the same water - just at different pressures."* - [[Taverner Bubbles Mc Gill]] ## Player-Facing Summary Pearl Harbor City is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Pearl Harbor City as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Pearl Harbor City. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Secret Covenant - Summon ancient evil ## Plot Hooks - A noble needs help stealing before the new moon

- Someone is protecting information for revenge
- Someone is blackmailing information for love
