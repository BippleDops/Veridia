# Dire Charm (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 200 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
You magically infect a living creature with murderous impulses, unless that crea-ture makes a successful Wisdom saving throw. If the saving throw fails, that creature will instantly go berserk, similar to a barbar-ianâ€™s rage, and will instantly seek to destroy everyone around, friend and foe alike. The creature will not attack you unless you attack it first.

While raging, the creature has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, does bonus damage equal to your spell attack modifier when making an attack that uses Strength, and has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. The creature cannot cast spells or use missile attacks while raging. At the end of the rage, the creature will take a level of ex-haustion.
