--- # Instrument of Illusions

*Wondrous item, common* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/instrument-of-illusions.webp#right) While you are playing this [[musical-instrument-xphb (items), you can take a [actions#Magic|Magic]] action to create harmless, illusory visual effects within a 5-foot [[Area of Effect Xphb originating from the instrument. If you are a Bard, the size of the [Area of Effect Xphb]] increases to 15 feet. Sample visual effects include luminous musical notes, a spectral dancer, butterflies, and gently falling snow. The magical effects have neither substance nor sound, and they are obviously illusory. The effects end when you stop playing. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 271* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Instrument of illusions xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
