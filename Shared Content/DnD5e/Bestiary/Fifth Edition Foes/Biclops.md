## Description
Despite their ferocious appearance, biclopes are generally peaceable creatures who live by hunting and herding giant longhorn sheep, which they keep for milk and wool. They are feared by less intelligent giants such as hill giants and trolls, whom most biclops will beat to death on sight. Biclopes have good relations with stone giants, with whom they trade finished metal weapons and goat cheese in exchange for raw ore and gold.

Adult male biclopes stand about 16 feet tall and weigh about 4,500 pounds. Females are slightly shorter and lighter. Both males and females dress in clothes of dark or dull colors (browns, greens, and dark reds are typical). Biclops skin ranges from ruddy brown to cinnamon, and their eye color is usually blue. Hair color is almost universally dark, though occasionally a fair-haired biclops is born (such a biclops is viewed as special among his or her kind). Warriors and protectors wear hide armor (sometimes with human-sized breastplates and other armor bits riveted on), and they always carry weapons. A biclops can live to be 350 years old. Biclopes fight with twin longswords. Each arm is controlled independently by a separate head. If given advanced warning, they prefer to chase off intruders with well-aimed spears and boulders hurled from great heights. They’ve also been known to rig controlled avalanches to crush invaders.

Biclopes live in tribelike communities in remote hills and mountains. They construct their homes from the stones and lumber of their environment. A typical biclops home has three rooms: a communal area where the family meets, a sleeping room, and a kitchen. Biclops families rely on each other for protection, food, and trade. External trade is often set up between biclopes and other races, particularly stone giants and dwarves. Less reputable tribes take prisoners for forced labor or even cannibalize humanoids and monstrous humanoids. In such a case, there is a 20% chance that a biclops lair contains `dice: 1d4` captive humanoids or monstrous humanoids.

Biclops leaders are usually fighters or barbarians. Most groups of biclopes include clerics (sometimes called shamans among the biclops race). Sorcerers, warlocks, and wizards are extremely rare among biclopes.
