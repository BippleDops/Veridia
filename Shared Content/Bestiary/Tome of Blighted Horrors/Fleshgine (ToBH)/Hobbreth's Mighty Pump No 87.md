# Hobbreth's Mighty Pump No 87
## Overview
*The stench of sweat and the distant sounds of heavy breathing engulf you — whatever it is, you are catching the merest glimpse of the whole. In the oily dark you can see sickly appendages gulping, a horrible sense of brooding vastness, and a glowering cluster of eyes filled with misery just below a vast, idiot, crooked mouth.*

## Special Traits
**Berserk:** Every time the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] is injured in combat, roll `dice: d100`. If the result is less than or equal to the total number of hit points the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] has lost so far in this combat, its elemental spirit breaks free and the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] goes berserk. The berserk [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] attacks the nearest living creature; if no creature is close enough to attack with a single move, it attacks an object instead. The [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]]’s controller can try to reestablish control, provided the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] is within 60 feet. The controller must use an action to speak firmly and authoritatively to the construct and make a successful DC 15 Charisma check. A damaged [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] that spends at least 1 minute outside combat has its chance to go berserk reset to 0 percent.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] bites once and makes three tentacle attacks in any combination.

**Melee Attack—Bite:** +14 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d10 + 10` piercing damage.

**Melee Attack—Tentacle Slam:** +14 to hit (reach 20 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 4d6 + 10` bludgeoning damage.

**Melee Attack—Tentacle Grab:** +14 to hit (reach 15 ft.; one creature). Hit: creature is grappled (escape DC 20).

**Melee Attack—Tentacle Crush:** automatic hit (one creature already grappled by the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]]). Hit: `dice: 4d10 + 10` bludgeoning damage, and the creature is restrained.

## Description
**Environment**: Urban (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Spells/PHB Spells/A-E/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary

title: Flavor
“You can’t see her all, of course, even I never did when I was stitching her and moulding her, making her flesh and breathing life into my baby. I recall her formation though, her crisp newness — the endless flesh, and the stench of pigs — for it was pig-flesh I grew and nurtured, and spread across her carcass like a great sail on a vast living sailing vessel.

In her base she is all purpose — her many sucking mouths, which in truth I suppose you’d call tentacles (if such a crude word could be used for such grace), with so many eyes clustered together so she can see from her sweaty groin below that pointless mouth — she must have a mouth, of course. Her flesh engorges above, like some vast flaccid organ that could fill a great hall, bloated, booming, pumping. Veins cross her every inch — you can see the swelling blood pumping as she draws her harvest upward through her cathedral mass far, far above.

She rises then, reaching high into the city, her pumping limbs extending endlessly upward with surprising — some have said alarming — strength to the digits that grasp her farthest reach. Some have likened the digits to fleshy spiders, but I think that’s simple scare-mongering to frighten children; they simply grip the vessel they spend her harvest into. And here her harvest is drawn, the life-giving water that sustains those in the streets high above pumped from sphincter mouths between each cluster of thin many-jointed hands.

It may taste a little of her sweat — her feral porcine nature — but it is water, saving the lower city from drowning and keeping the upper city drinking.

How many have I made? Oh, hundreds, no two quite alike. The stories about them going berserk? Rubbish put about by those with a grievance — anarchists would say anything to cause discontent amongst the ignorant.

I do sometimes wonder if they have a soul, though, my fleshy babies lurking between walls and dreaming. What do they dream of, I wonder?”
