A critical political investigation where Ambassador Nereon Peacekeeper, Aquabyssos's chief diplomat to the surface kingdoms, has disappeared during sensitive treaty negotiations. His vanishing threatens to destabilize fragile peace talks and potentially trigger international conflict. Time is running out as both sides grow suspicious, and without resolution, years of diplomatic progress could be lost. ## The Situation
