# Slippers of Spider Climbing
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/slippers-of-spider-climbing.webp#right)


While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a [[climb-speed-xphb|Climb Speed]] equal to your [[speed-xphb|Speed]]. However, the slippers don't allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.
