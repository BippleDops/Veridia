# Potion of Speed
*Potion, very rare*  


- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [[haste-xphb|Haste]] spell for 1 minute (no [[conditions#Concentration|Concentration]] required) without suffering the wave of lethargy that typically occurs when the effect ends.

This potion's yellow fluid is streaked with black and swirls on its own.
