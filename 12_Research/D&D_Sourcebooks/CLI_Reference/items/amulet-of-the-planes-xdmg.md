# Amulet of the Planes
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/amulet-of-the-planes.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

While wearing this amulet, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence ([[skills#Arcana|Arcana]]) check. On a successful check, you cast [[plane-shift-xphb|Plane Shift]]. On a failed check, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination determined by rolling `d100` and consulting the following table.

`dice: [](amulet-of-the-planes-xdmg.md#^1-destination)`

| dice: 1d100 | Destination |
|-------------|-------------|
| 01-60 | Random location on the plane you named |
| 61-70 | Random location on an Inner Plane determined by rolling `d6`: on a **1**, the Plane of Air; on a **2**, the Plane of Earth; on a **3**, the Plane of Fire; on a **4**, the Plane of Water; on a **5**, the Feywild; on a **6**, the Shadowfell |
| 71-80 | Random location on an Outer Plane determined by rolling 1d8: on a **1**, Arborea; on a **2**, Arcadia; on a **3**, the Beastlands; on a **4**, Bytopia; on a **5**, Elysium; on a **6**, Mechanus; on a **7**, Mount Celestia; on an **8**, Ysgard |
| 81-90 | Random location on an Outer Plane determined by rolling `d8`: on a **1**, the Abyss; on a **2**, Acheron; on a **3**, Carceri; on a **4**, Gehenna; on a **5**, Hades; on a **6**, Limbo; on a **7**, the Nine Hells; on an **8**, Pandemonium |
