## Description
Sandlings are creatures from the Elemental Plane of Earth. A sandling in its natural form resembles a mound of sand that covers a 10-foot area. A typical sandling is 10 feet long but can grow to a length of 20 to 25 feet.

If one visits the Material Plane, it probably was summoned by a spellcaster of some type. Occasionally a sandling slips through a vortex between the planes, but that’s a rare occurrence. Sandlings live on a diet of minerals only. They can’t digest plants, herbs, meat, or any other substance that has ever been alive. Creatures killed by a sandling are left where they fall.

Sandlings are entirely solitary, and they have no societal structure of any kind. Though they harbor no ill-will toward others of their kind, it is very rare to find two or more sandlings even near one another, let alone cooperating. It is believed that a new sandling is created when one grows large enough to divide in half.
