## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_

On Initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Graz'zt can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Graz'zt casts the [[command-xphb (spells)]] spell on every creature of his choice in the lair. He needn't see each one, but he must be aware that an individual is in the lair to target that creature. He issues the same command to all the targets.  
- Smooth surfaces within the lair become as reflective as a polished mirror. Until a different lair action is used, creatures within the lair have disadvantage on Dexterity ([[skills#Stealth|Stealth]]) checks made to hide.  

## Regional effects

The region containing Graz'zt's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- Flat surfaces within 1 mile of the lair that are made of stone or metal become highly reflective, as though polished to a shine. These surfaces become supernaturally mirrorlike.  
- Wild beasts within 6 miles of the lair break into frequent conflicts and coupling, mirroring the behavior that occurs during their mating seasons.  
- If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Graz'zt table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.  

If Graz'zt dies, these effects fade over the course of `d10` days.

### Madness of Graz'zt

If a creature goes mad in Graz'zt's lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Graz'zt table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for more on madness.

**Madness of Graz'zt**

`dice: [](grazzt-mtf.md#^madness-of-grazzt)`

| dice: d100 | Flaw (lasts until cured) |
|------------|--------------------------|
| 01â€“20 | "There is nothing in the world more important than me and my desires." |
| 21â€“40 | "Anyone who doesn't do exactly what I say doesn't deserve to live." |
| 41â€“60 | "Mine is the path of redemption. Anyone who says otherwise is intentionally misleading you." |
| 61â€“80 | "I will not rest until I have made someone else mine, and doing so is more important to me than my own lifeâ€”or the lives of others." |
| 81â€“90 | "My own pleasure is of paramount importance. Everything else, including social graces, is a triviality." |
| 91â€“00 | "Anything that can bring me happiness should be enjoyed immediately. There is no point to saving anything pleasurable for later." |
