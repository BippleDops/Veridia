# Session 5: Descent into Darkness
## Act 2 Begins - Journey to Tenebrarum

> *"In Tenebrarum, your shadow isn't cast by you‚Äîyou're cast by it."*

## üé¨ Strong Start
The party boards the Dream Rails to Tenebrarum, but mid-journey, the train stops in a nightmare. They're in a surgical theater where shadows are being transplanted into paralyzed surface dwellers. One victim locks eyes with a party member‚Äîit's someone from their backstory, pleading silently for help as their shadow is peeled away like skin.

## üé≠ Scenes

### Scene 1: The Dream Rail Horror
**Location**: Nightmare Transit between continents  
**Situation**: Train stuck in collective surgical nightmare  
**Conflict**: Must restart the dream engine while avoiding nightmare surgeons  
**Discoveries**:

### Scene 2: Tenebrarum Border - The Shadow Checkpoint
**Location**: Entry to [[Tenebrarum]] - The Penumbral Gates  
**Situation**: All visitors must register their shadows  
**Conflict**: Party's shadows are flagged as "persons of interest"  
**Discoveries**:
- Shadows are considered separate legal entities here
- A shadow court has issued warrants for the party
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Shadow Duchess Nyx|02 Worldbuilding/People/Shadow Duchess Nyx]] has immunity but won't extend it
- The checkpoint has holding cells full of separated shadows

**Roleplay Challenge**:
- Negotiate with shadows directly
- Each PC's shadow has different demands

### Scene 3: The Umbral Exchange
**Location**: [[The Shadow Markets]] - Central Trading Floor  
**Situation**: Infiltrate the shadow auction

### Scene 4: The Surgeon's Invitation
**Location**: Private surgical suite  
**Situation**: Head Surgeon offers a "deal"  
**Conflict**: Trade information for shadow modifications  
**Discoveries**:
- Surgeons aren't human anymore‚Äîthey're living shadows wearing flesh
- The procedure would make party immune to harvest

## üé™ Cliffhanger Ending
The party acquires crucial intel about the harvest control center in [[Crystallium]], but as they prepare to leave Tenebrarum, every shadow in the city suddenly freezes in place. A voice echoes from all shadows simultaneously: "The Parliament of Shadows has reached a verdict. Original-kind is found guilty of oppression. The sentence is replacement. The Deep Harvest begins at the next tide‚Äîin six hours. Those who resist will watch their shadows devour their loved ones first." 

Marina's shadow turns to the party: "I can get you to Crystallium, but only if you help me kill my original. She's not who you think she is." Marina herself draws her weapon: "Don't listen to it. I'm the real Marina. That thing stole my life three years ago."

The party must choose who to trust as shadow enforcers surround their location.

- Use shadow puppets or lighting effects at table
- Shadows know PC backstory secrets
- Consider splitting party between original/shadow loyalty
