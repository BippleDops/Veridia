# Surface Signals

![[04_Resources/Assets/Art/Places/Surface_Signals.png|Surface Signals Portrait

*The crackling voices from the world above the waves*

## Overview

Surface Signals is both a location and a phenomenon—a series of crystalline receiver stations scattered throughout the upper reaches of Aquabyssos that intercept communications from the surface world. These stations, built by an unknown civilization, translate electromagnetic waves into pressure vibrations that can be understood underwater, creating windows into the air-breathing world above.

The primary station, located in the Twilight Reaches just 500 feet below the surface, has become a pilgrimage site for those seeking news of the surface, messages from lost loved ones, or intelligence about the world above the waves. However, the signals received are not always from the present—some come from the past, others from the future, and some from surfaces that may not exist in this reality.

## The Signal Phenomenon

### Types of Transmissions

**Contemporary Broadcasts**
- Radio communications from ships above
- Emergency distress calls
- Military encrypted messages
- Commercial broadcasting that bleeds through
- Weather warnings and navigation data

**Temporal Echoes**
- Messages from decades past playing on loop
- Future transmissions warning of events
- Conversations that haven't happened yet
- Final words of sinking ships
- Victory announcements from wars not yet fought

**Dimensional Bleed**
- Signals from parallel surfaces
- Worlds where Aquabyssos never sank
- Realities where the ocean is gone
- Communications from inside-out worlds
- Messages from surfaces that are underwater

**Consciousness Streams**
- Dying thoughts of drowning sailors
- Dreams of surface dwellers about the ocean
- Collective unconscious of coastal cities
- Prayers to sea gods
- Love letters never sent to those below

### Signal Patterns

**The Dawn Chorus**
Every sunrise, all stations simultaneously broadcast:
- Children singing in unknown languages
- Ship bells ringing in harmony
- Weather reports from nonexistent cities
- Numbers stations counting in sequence
- Whale songs from above the water

**The Midnight Static**
At the deepest night, signals become:
- Incomprehensible but meaningful
- Emotionally overwhelming
- Prophetic but unclear
- Dangerous to interpret
- Possibly alive

**Storm Surges**
During surface storms, transmissions include:
- Overlapping distress calls from all eras
- Lightning converted to sound
- Wind patterns as musical notation
- Rain impacts as coded messages
- Thunder as divine communication

## Physical Infrastructure

### The Primary Station

**The Resonance Cathedral**
A massive crystalline structure resembling a frozen whirlpool:
- **Height**: 300 feet
- **Diameter**: 200 feet at base, 500 feet at crown
- **Composition**: Unknown singing crystal
- **Age**: Predates recorded history

**Architectural Features**:
- Acoustic chambers that sort signals by type
- Probability antennas that catch potential messages
- Temporal tuning forks for different eras
- Emotional resonators for consciousness streams
- Reality filters to separate dimensional signals

### Secondary Stations

**The Echo Pods**
Smaller receivers scattered throughout upper Aquabyssos:
- 27 confirmed locations
- Each attuned to different frequencies
- Some mobile, following currents
- Others anchored to specific coordinates
- A few phase in and out of existence

**Signal Characteristics by Station**:

| Station | Primary Reception | Unique Feature |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| Echo-1 | Military channels | Decrypts automatically |
| Echo-7 | Love songs | Makes listeners weep |
| Echo-13 | Future news | Always 7 days ahead |
| Echo-19 | Dead languages | Translates to listener's tongue |
| Echo-23 | Surface thoughts | Causes telepathy |
| Echo-27 | Divine broadcasts | Burns heretics |

### The Broken Transmitter

A destroyed station that still receives but can also send:
- Only works during eclipses
- Messages arrive before being sent
- Responses come from wrong realities
- Sometimes the surface responds
- Occasionally something else answers

## Dangers and Hazards

### Signal Madness
Prolonged exposure causes:
- Hearing voices constantly
- Cannot distinguish reality from broadcast
- Compulsive listening behavior
- Physical transformation into receiver
- Complete loss of self to signal stream

### Infectious Transmissions
Some signals are themselves dangerous:
- Memetic viruses that spread through hearing
- Kill commands that trigger dormant programming
- Conversion signals that change beliefs
- Possession frequencies carrying entities
- Reality errors that corrupt existence

### Temporal Paradoxes
Learning future information creates:
- Causality loops
- Grandfather paradoxes
- Timeline contamination
- Reality contradictions
- Existence failures

### The Watchers
Entities that monitor who listens:
- Surface governments tracking interceptors
- Alien intelligences noting contact
- Divine beings marking souls
- Temporal police preventing paradoxes
- Things that shouldn't exist but do

## Adventure Hooks

### The Drowning Forecast
The stations begin broadcasting a massive catastrophe that will sink another surface city in seven days. The party must decide whether to warn them, knowing that surface contact is forbidden and might cause the very disaster they're trying to prevent.

### The Love Frequency
A noble offers vast wealth to maintain communication with their surface lover through the broken transmitter. But each message sent changes reality slightly, and the changes are becoming dangerous.

### The Silent Station
Echo-13 has gone completely silent for the first time in recorded history. The last transmission was a single word: "Run." Investigation reveals something is consuming the signals themselves.

### The God Wave
A new frequency appears claiming to be a surface god offering to raise Aquabyssos back to the surface. But the price is forgetting the centuries underwater, erasing all current culture and identity.

### The Revolution Broadcast
Someone is using the stations to coordinate a simultaneous uprising across all of Aquabyssos. The signals are coming from the future, describing a revolution that hasn't happened yet—unless someone stops it.

## The Deep Secret

### The Truth About Surface Signals

The signals aren't from the surface at all. They're from Aquabyssos itself—from potential futures where the city rose again. Every broadcast is a possibility, a maybe, a could-be. The stations don't receive; they dream.

The "surface world" being monitored doesn't exist yet. It's the collective unconscious of Aquabyssos imagining what could be if they ever escape the depths. The signals are prophecies disguised as news, hopes disguised as intelligence, fears disguised as warnings.

Those who discover this truth face a choice: maintain the comforting lie that a surface world exists, or reveal that Aquabyssos might be more alone than anyone imagined.

## DM Notes

### Running Surface Signals

**Information Management**:
- Use signals to introduce plot hooks
- Provide conflicting information
- Create urgency through "breaking news"
- Foreshadow events through future signals
- Mislead through alternate dimension broadcasts

**Signal Content Generation**:
Roll d20 for random signals:
1-4: Current surface news
5-8: Historical broadcast
9-12: Personal message
13-15: Encrypted/mysterious
16-18: Future transmission
19: Dimensional bleed
20: Something impossible

**Addiction Mechanics**:
- Track exposure hours
- Constitution saves after extended listening
- Gradual dependency development
- Physical and mental symptoms

### Campaign Integration

Surface Signals serves as:
- Information hub for party
- Source of quest hooks
- Mystery to investigate
- Communication method with surface allies
