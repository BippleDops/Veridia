# Ki-rin

## Lair actions
_Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters_

Inside its lair, a ki-rin has the power to conjure objects up to three times per day, using each of the following versions of the power once. One version permanently creates enough objects made of soft, plant-based material - including manufactured objects such as cloth, pillows, rope, blankets, and clothing - to fill a cube 20 feet on a side. The second version permanently creates enough objects made of wood, or similarly hard plant-based material, to fill a cube 10 feet on a side. The third version creates enough objects made of stone or metal to fill a cube 2 feet on a side, but any materials created in this way last for only 1 hour.

## Regional effects
_Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters_

The ki-rin's celestial nature transforms the region around its lair. Any of the following magical effects is possible for travelers to encounter in the vicinity:

- Water flows pure within 3 miles of a ki-rin's lair. Any purposeful corruption of the water lasts for no longer than 3 minutes.  
- Animals, plants, and good creatures within 3 miles of the ki-rin's lair gain vigor as they evolve toward an idealized form. Such creatures are rarely aggressive toward others that aren't normally prey. Evil creatures can't tolerate the holy atmosphere within the same distance, and usually choose to live much farther from the domain of a ki-rin.  
- Curses, diseases, and poisons affecting good-aligned creatures are suppressed when those creatures are within 3 miles of the lair.  
- A ki-rin can cast [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/control-weather-xphb|control weather]] while it is within 3 miles of its lair. The spell's point of origin is always the point outdoors closest to the center of its lair. The ki-rin doesn't need to maintain a clear path to the sky or to concentrate for the change in weather to persist.  
- Within 3 miles of the lair, winds buoy non-evil creatures that fall due to no act of the ki-rin or its allies. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no falling damage.  

When the ki-rin dies, all these effects disappear immediately, although the invigorating effect on flora and fauna remains for 3 years.
