## Overview

Life in [[Aethermoor]] moves with the rhythm of winds and the dance of sky currents. The floating cities and cloud-bound settlements have developed intricate daily patterns that honor both the freedom of flight and the practical necessities of aerial existence. Every aspect of daily life is touched by the three-dimensional nature of sky living, from wind-powered morning routines to evening migrations between floating districts.
