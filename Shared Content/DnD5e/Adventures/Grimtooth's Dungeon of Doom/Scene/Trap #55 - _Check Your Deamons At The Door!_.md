# Trap #55 - "Check Your Deamons At The Door!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> It doesn't matter how the party finds its way to this point. It will either be by the noble, tortureous route, the party having gone through every other alternative, and then finally having the significance of the "pirate map" made clear to them. Or it will possibly be after the crystal warrior/delver polisher, that some architectural genius will come up with an idea. "Why does a 20 foot corridor lead to two 10 foot doors set at right angles, and leave me facing a blank wall?"
> 
> In either event the party will find that they have to scrape off a substantial amount of stucco to reveal these doors. When they have they find themselves facing two 10 foot high 10 foot wide bronze doors. On these doors is depicted the final battle of Evinrood's career. The confrontation with the lord of the deamons!
> 
> On the right hand door can be found the image of a tall, imposing, dead eyed man. This is Selgolub Lord of the Deamons. About him are the twisted visiages of halfhuman nightmare things, vile charactures of things that might have been created in an evil dream. They are directed at the figures on the left hand door in magical onslaught.
> 
> On the left hand door is the depiction of a stumpy, harried figure, arms upraised, marshaling his forces. This can be recognized from other doors like this throughout the tomb as the image of Evinrood Lord of the Elementals. All about him are the humanoid shapes of pure energy that represent the elementals. This strange force when compared to the things on the right hand door seem pure, and somehow pathetic!
> 
> But enough of this maudlin drivel The art tour will be through after the tomb robbers have taken all the good stuff. These doors both have three finger holes in them . (That makes 6 altogether for those warriors in the party.) Those in the right hand door have an aura of magic about them. This will prompt the party to try the ones on the left. Too bad, as in that case all three will work as digit dicers, and the door still will not open. (No these doors will not respond to the low level magic opening spell of all the others.) To open the left hand door the party must first try the right hand holes!
> 
> This is the real trap and regretably it only works on deamons, elementals, creatures who owe their existence to magic alone, (like Tsunami warriors, and Elemental men.) or beings consisting of magical force. If any of this limited fraternity insert anything into these holes they will be slowly, and messily, sucked into the finger holes. Keep track of the beings thus affected' s physical Strength, and Intelligence, it will be potentially relevent later on. If normal mortals, or nonmagically sustained creatures stick digits in, they will feel a cold chill. This is except for any elvish delvers: they will feel an electric shock, mild unfortunately, but startling. (It's a little trick of my own added for laughs, to zap a few of the high browed, pointyeared wood rats.)
> 
> After the party has tried the right hand door the left hand door will work in the usual manner. The huge doors will open, revealing a chamber.
> 
> The door is a four skull trap for those types of beings affected; all others will only be affected by the left not working until the right does, one skull at best.
