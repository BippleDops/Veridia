*2nd-level, Transmutation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour You alter your physical form. Choose one of the following options.

You can breathe underwater and gain a [swim-speed-xphb (variant-rules)]] equal to your [[Fly Speed Xphb. ## Change Appearance You alter your appearance. You decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and other distinguishing characteristics. You can make yourself appear as a member of another species, though none of your statistics change. You can't appear as a creature of a different size, and your basic shape stays the same; if you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. For the duration, you can take a [actions#Magic|Magic]] action to change your appearance in this way again. ## Natural Weapons You grow claws (Slashing), fangs (Piercing), horns (Piercing), or hooves (Bludgeoning). When you use your [[Unarmed Strike Xphb to deal damage with that new growth, it deals`d6`damage of the type in parentheses instead of dealing the normal damage for your [Unarmed Strike Xphb]], and you use your spellcasting ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls rather than using Strength. ## Summary **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 239.

Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
