# Second-Head Fluke
## Overview
```ad-warning
title: GM Directions
collapse: open
This dreaded microscopic parasite is relatively common in the Lyme River, and many fishermen have caught the sickness after accidentally swallowing Lyme water. It can also be spread by physical contact with those already afflicted.

This foul sickness manifests as a large, swollen tumor on the victim’s shoulder that, over a period of 4–6 days, grows into a second, cankerous head. This head is most horrible to look upon, consisting of disfigured and distorted features, random tufts of hair, misplaced teeth, and dark patches of melanoma. Despite its obvious disease origin, this head-like growth uncannily resembles the victim, even in its distorted and horrifying state.

Once a case of second-head fluke is contracted, madness and physical decline are sure to follow. After the second head fully manifests, the victim must make a successful DC 13 Wis saving throw each day or lose `dice: 1d3` points of Wisdom. In addition, each day there is a 10% chance that the victim loses 1 point of Constitution from the cancerous disease.

When the victim’s Wisdom drops to half or less of its starting value, the second-head fluke begins having more pronounced effects. The pseudo-head utters nonsensical vocal sounds as if trying to talk, and the head flops about spasmodically at random times. In close quarters, the head tends to flop toward nearby creatures, and anyone who comes in contact with it or the host must make a successful DC 13 Con saving throw or contract a second-head fluke infestation of their own.

Second-head fluke is notoriously difficult to cure.

- Stage 1: Before the pseudo-head has grown,* lesser restoration* or comparable magic reverses the growth and cures the victim completely.

- Stage 2: Once the pseudo-head has fully formed, the disease can be cured by removing the head surgically, then casting* lesser restoration*. The patient takes `dice: 2d6` slashing damage, and the surgeon must make a DC 15 Wis (Medicine) check; only someone with proficiency in Medicine can even attempt the procedure. Whether the operation succeeded won’t be known until six days later; if a new, cancerous head doesn’t grow, then the surgery succeeded.

- Stage 3: Once the victim’s Wisdom score is reduced to half or less of its starting value, the disease can be cured only with surgery (as above) and* greater restoration* or comparable magic. This casting of *greater restoration* doesn’t restore lost Wisdom points, but a subsequent casting does.

Lost Wisdom and Constitution points don’t recover normally but can be restored with magic.
