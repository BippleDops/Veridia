## Special Traits
**Air Mastery:** Airborne creatures have tactical disadvantage on attacks against a hawanar.

**Holocone:** A hawanar can transform into a vortex of embers and white-hot fire as a bonus action and can remain in this form for up to six rounds. Once it changes back to its normal form, it can't resume its holocone form for another 10 minutes. In holocone form, the hawanar genie can move through the air or along any surface at its fly speed. It can move through spaces occupied by other creatures; creatures of Medium size or smaller must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be swept into the vortex, taking 14 (`dice: 2d8+5`) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (`dice: 1d8`) fire damage and being grappled by the genie, which can then move the grappled creature according to the normal grappling rules. The genie can't end its move in the same space as a character it isn't grappling.

**Mobility:** When a hawanar genie moves, opportunity attacks against it have tactical disadvantage

**Spell-like Abilities:** A hawanar genie can use the following spell-like abilities, using Charisma as its casting ability (DC 13, attack +5). The genie doesn’t need material components to use these abilities.

- At will: *plane shift (willing targets to elemental planes, Astral Plane, or Material Plane only)*

- 1/day: *burning hands, create wine and water (as create food and water, but creates wine instead of water), fireball, gaseous form, invisibility (self only), major image, scorching ray (3 rays), wall of fire, wind walk*

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A hawanar genie attacks twice with fists or twice with its falchion, or uses a spelllike ability.

**Fist:** *Melee Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (`dice: 2d8+5`) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (`dice: 1d8`) fire damage.

**Falchion:** +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (`dice: 2d8+5`) slashing damage plus 3 (`dice: 1d6`) fire damage. This attack scores a critical hit if the hawanar's attack roll is a natural 18, 19, or 20.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any (Plane of Elemental Air or Plane of Elemental Fire)

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, company (2–4), or band (6–15)

## Description
Hawanar are the unlikely union of an efreeti noble and a djinni noble. Neither of the parent races truly accepts the hawanar; the djinn are somewhat tolerant, while the efreet usually execute or enslave hawanar offspring, viewing them as something unnatural.

A typical hawanar stands 12 feet tall and weighs about 1,100 pounds.

Hawanar society is ruled by a rajah who is served by a multitude of beys, sheiks, sahibs, and sirdars The hawanar race has no true home and can be found spread throughout the planes (most dwell on the Plane of Air or a pocket plane of air and fire). Those that dwell on the Plane of Fire generally avoid the City of Brass and efreeti patrols because of the disdain the efreet have for them.

Hawanar wade into battle in a hail of fire and wind, relying on their spell-like abilities and holocone form to vanquish opponents. If combat goes against it, a hawanar slips into holocone form or becomes gaseous and flees.
