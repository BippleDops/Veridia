### Enhancement Improvements

## Lightning

When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the target to take an extra `2d6` Lightning damage (no action required).

## Thunder

When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the staff to emit a crack of thunder audible out to 300 feet (no action required). The target you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the [[conditions#Stunned|Stunned]] condition until the end of your next turn.

## Thunder and Lightning

Immediately after you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can take a [[bonus action xphb|Bonus Action]] to use the Lightning and Thunder properties (see above) at the same time. Doing so doesn't expend the daily use of those properties, only the use of this one.

## Lightning Strike

You can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the staff's tip in a [[line area of effect xphb|Line]] that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. Each creature in that [[line area of effect xphb|Line]] makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking `9d6` Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Thunderclap

You can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to cause the staff to produce a thunderclap audible out to 600 feet. Every creature within a 60-foot [[emanation area of effect xphb|Emanation]] originating from you makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `2d6` Thunder damage and has the [[conditions#Deafened|Deafened]] condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.
