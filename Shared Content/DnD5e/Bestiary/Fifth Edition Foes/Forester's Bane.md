## Special Traits
**Grasping Tendrils:** A creature grappled by a forester's bane can break free by winning a Strength contest against the plant or by inflicting 10 slashing damage against the grappling leaf, thereby severing it from the plant. Grappling leaves have AC 10. Damage done to a leaf is not subtracted from the plant's overall hit points. If a creature is grappled by more than one leaf, each leaf must be severed or overpowered individually. Severed leaves grow back in one week, if the forester's bane survives the fight.

**Leaf:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature of size Medium or smaller. Hit: the target is grappled and restrained.

**Stalk:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, one creature grappled by a leaf. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d6+3`) slashing damage.

**Environment**: Temperate plains

**Organization**: Solitary or pair

## Description
Forester’s bane is a huge, immobile, carnivorous shrub. At the center of this low-growing shrub is a 3-foot diameter, tough, yellowish, spherical “trunk” from which sprout many small green branches. Each branch has small, sweet smelling (and tasting) berries of various colors growing from it. Large, tough leaves also radiate from the trunk. Close inspection (if possible) reveals that these dark green leaves hide six purple, serrated stalks inside the plant’s body. When a living creature moves near a forester’s bane, the plant tries to grab the creature. Trapped creatures are slashed and cut by the serrated stalks to make them bleed profusely into the ground around the plant. The plant makes no special effort to kill its victims; whether they’re alive or dead after bleeding onto its roots is of no concern to the forester’s bane. If one victim escapes, the plant would rather catch a fresh victim than try to squeeze more sustenance from a creature that’s already low on blood.

## Additional Details
