# Frigid Water
*Environmental Hazard*  

A creature can be immersed in frigid water for a number of minutes equal to its Constitution score before suffering any ill effects. Each additional minute spent in frigid water requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] level. Creatures with [[resistance-xphb|Resistance]] or [[immunity-xphb|Immunity]] to Cold damage automatically succeed on the save, as do creatures that are naturally adapted to living in ice-cold water.
