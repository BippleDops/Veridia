# Bearhug (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a bit of bear fur)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You gain the ability to bear hug a crea-ture within one size category of you. If you successfully make an unarmed attack, you can grapple that creature (escape DC is equal to your spell save DC). As long as the grap-ple remains in effect, that target is restrained. At the start of each of your turns, you may constrict, doing 2d8 + your Strength modifier in bludgeoning damage.
