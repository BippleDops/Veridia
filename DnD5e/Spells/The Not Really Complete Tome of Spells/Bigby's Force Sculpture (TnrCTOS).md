# Bigby's Force Sculpture (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a lump of clay with diamond dust in it)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour


## Effects
You create a visible plane of shimmering force that you can shape in any form you wish. The object you create must be fairly rigid, have no moving parts, and cannot pos-sess finely-detailed features and cannot be larger than 10 cubic feet. If you create a weapon with it, it does 1d8 + your Strength modified bludgeoning damage.

The force sculpture is an object that has AC 15 and 15 hit points. When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the sculpture up to 30 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When cast with a 6th-or 7th-level spell slot, you can make a more complex sculpture. The item can have large, moving parts or have an edge or point, but it must still be rigid and cannot be larger than 50 cubic feet. It has AC 18 and has 20 hit points.

When cast with an 8th or 9th-level spell slot, the sculpture can be very complex, contain small moving parts, and be very flexible. It can be any size up to 100 cubic feet.
