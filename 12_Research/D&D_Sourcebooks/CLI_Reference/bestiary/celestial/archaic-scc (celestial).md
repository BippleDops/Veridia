*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 184* Archaics are towering, multi-armed creatures overflowing with magic. Despite their solitude, archaics carry vast understanding of magic and the world's history, as well as the ability to warp the fabric of the world around them. Sages who seek out archaics for their knowledge receive confusing and often contradictory answers to questions. If a supplicant successfully unwinds the tangle, the answer they seek is revealed. In truth, archaics are the reincarnated souls of the oracles of Strixhaven. When an oracle dies, their soul travels back through time to the explosion of magic that brought the Founder Dragons into being. In that outrush of creative force, the oracle's soul can be caught in the tide and clad in the very substance of the world, becoming an archaic. Because their knowledge cuts across the flow of time, archaics are careful how much they reveal to mortals and thus tend to speak in riddles.```statblock
