## Special Traits
**Aversion to Daylight:** Boneneedles shun light. While exposed to natural (not magical) sunlight, they have tactical disadvantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.

**Boneneedle Poison:** The bite of a boneneedle injects a syrupy neurotoxin that destroys flesh and weakens bone. A creature that fails its saving throw against boneneedle poison gains the poisoned condition. While the creature is poisoned by boneneedle poison, it also takes an extra 2 points of damage whenever it takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage. Cumulative bites do not increase the extra damage. The poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw after a long or short rest, ending the poisoned condition with a successful save. A lesser restoration spell or comparable magic also neutralizes the poison.

**Crowd:** Up to three boneneedles can occupy the same 5-foot space.

## Actions
**Bite:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: (`dice: 1d6+2`) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned suffering the effect of boneneedle poison (see above).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Subterranean

**Organization**: Pack (3–6), cluster (5–8), or nest (12–24 plus 2–4 [[Boneneedle, Greater|greater boneneedles]])

## Description
Boneneedles are eyeless, bone-white creatures that resemble a blob of semi-translucent flesh with eight spindly, spidery legs colored black or gold. These creatures feed on bone marrow, so their lairs are always scattered with the cracked, deformed bones of their victims, both humanoid and animal. A [[Boneneedle, Greater|greater boneneedle]] is a larger version of the lesser, They appear to be nothing more than lesser boneneedles that have survived long enough to grow larger than their nest mates.

They make their lairs deep underground to avoid natural daylight, though some brave the surface world by venturing from their lairs at night. Such surface encounters are rare, and will always be with at least a pack of greater and lesser boneneedles. Boneneedles flee from natural daylight if at all possible.

Other than the nest, boneneedles have no particular social structure, though they do cooperate when hunting and feeding. Very young boneneedles are generally nonthreatening, as they lack the deadly poison injectors that adults possess.

A boneneedle’s mandibles are glossy-black and hollow, both to inject poison and to siphon out the dissolved flesh and bone from a victim’s corpse. While feeding, the boneneedle’s fleshy form pulsates and expands. After feeding, its form becomes less translucent and takes on a greenish yellow color.

These creatures are highly aggressive and opportunistic hunters. Using their coloration, they hide among piles of bones in their lair and wait for living creatures to wander close by. When prey comes within 20 or 30 feet, the boneneedles dart from their hiding places to swarm the victim.
