--- # Simultaneous Effects

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 374. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* If two or more things happen at the same time on a turn, the person at the game tableâ€”player or DM whose turn it is decides the order in which those things happen. For example, if two effects occur at the start of a [[Player Character Xphb]] turn, the player decides which of the effects happens first. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Simultaneous effects xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of simultaneous effects xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around simultaneous effects xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A stranger needs help finding before the new moon
