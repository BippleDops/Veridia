--- # Disadvantage

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 366. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* If you have Disadvantage on a [[d20-test-xphb (variant-rules)]], roll two d20s and use the lower roll. A roll can't be affected by more than one Disadvantage, and [[Advantage Xphb]] and Disadvantage on the same roll cancel each other. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Disadvantage xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of disadvantage xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around disadvantage xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Shadow Alliance - Control trade routes ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The First Prophecy of Stars ## Plot Hooks - Strange dreams suggest a portal

- Someone is protecting a witness for love

- Someone is searching for a artifact for revenge
