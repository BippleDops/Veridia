## Overview
The Shadowmire Tavern serves as one of Aquabyssos's premier neutral meeting grounds, where representatives from every faction, social class, and profession gather to drink, dine, and conduct business away from prying eyes. Built into a partially collapsed [[The Seven Shards]] crystalline formation, the tavern's unique architecture combines natural shadow-touched crystal with comfortable furnishings, creating an atmosphere where both legitimate business and questionable dealings can flourish under an unspoken code of mutual respect.
