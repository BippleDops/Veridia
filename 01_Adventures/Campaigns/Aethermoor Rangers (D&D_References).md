--- ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Aethermoor Rangers is a sky-borne element of the setting, known for brass fittings and cloudstone terraces. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Aethermoor Rangers as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Aethermoor Rangers. Therefore, ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Plot Hooks - Someone is blackmailing a witness for power

- A prisoner has gone missing and war looms
- A stranger needs help stealing before the festival
- A journal reveals a betrayal about the cult ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
