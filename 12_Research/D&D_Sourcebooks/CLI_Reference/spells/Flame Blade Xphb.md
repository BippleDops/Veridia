# Flame Blade
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sumac leaf)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke it again as a [[Action Xphb]].

As a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you can make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes Fire damage equal to `3d6` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

The flaming blade sheds [[Light Xphb]] in a 10-foot radius and [[Light Xphb]] for an additional 10 feet.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d6` for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]
