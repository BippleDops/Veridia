Creatures affected by grief have disadvantage on Wisdom saves against his spells. **Death's Embrace.** When a creature dies within 60 feet of Morteus, he regains 10 hit points and can cast a necromancy spell of 3rd level or lower as a bonus action without expending a spell slot. **Sorrow Aura.** Creatures that start their turn within 30 feet of Morteus must succeed on a **DC 19** Wisdom saving throw or be overwhelmed by sadness, suffering disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of their next turn. **Amphibious.** Morteus can breathe air and water. **Spellcasting.** Morteus is a 15th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save **DC 19**, +11 to hit). He has the following spells prepared: **Cleric Spells (Death Domain):**

- Cantrips (at will): *thaumaturgy*, *toll the dead*, *guidance*, *mending*
- 1st level (4 slots): *inflict wounds*, *detect magic*, *false life*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *hold person*, *gentle repose*, *ray of enfeeblement*

- 7th level (1 slot): *plane shift*, *resurrection*
- 8th level (1 slot): *antimagic field*, *clone* ## Actions **Multiattack.** Morteus makes two Grief Touch attacks or casts a spell and makes one attack. **Grief Touch.** *Melee Spell Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (`dice: 3d8` + 5) necrotic damage plus 9 (`dice: 2d8`) psychic damage. The target must succeed on a **DC 19** Wisdom save or be incapacitated by overwhelming sorrow for 1 round. **Mass Inflict Wounds (1/Day).** Morteus targets up to six creatures within 60 feet. Each target must make a **DC 19** Constitution saving throw, taking 45 (`dice: 10d8`) necrotic damage on failure, or half on success. **Summon Sorrow Wraiths (1/Day).** Morteus summons 3 wraiths that appear within 30 feet. They are composed of pure grief and last for 10 minutes or until destroyed. **Overwhelming Despair (1/Day).** All creatures within 60 feet must make a **DC 19** Charisma saving throw. On failure, they are stunned for 1 minute and take 21 (`dice: 6d6`) psychic damage at the start of each turn. They can repeat the save at the end of each turn. ## Description Morteus Grieveheart appears as a figure carved from living sorrow. His deep merfolk heritage shows in his elongated form and pale, almost translucent skin that seems to absorb light rather than reflect it. Standing 6'2" with an ethereal, gaunt frame, he moves with the slow, measured pace of one who has witnessed countless deaths. His most striking features are his eyes—completely black voids that seem to contain the collected tears of every soul he has "comforted" in their final moments. His hair flows like dark water, occasionally revealing glimpses of the many mourning symbols braided within. Intricate tattoos of funeral rites spiral across his arms and chest, each one representing a different culture's approach to death and grief. Morteus dwells in the Grief Gardens, a haunted grove where the water itself seems to weep. Here, surrounded by monuments to the dead and tended by his undead servants, he offers his services to those seeking to commune with lost loved ones—for a price that extends far beyond mere coin. ## Relationships **Allies:**

- **[[The Parasite Priests** - His order of death-worshippers who serve the cycle of entropy
- **[Shadow Parliament]]** - They appreciate his ability to silence opposition permanently
- **[[The Biomancers** - Trade information about life and death magic
- **Widow's Circle** - A secret society of grieving nobles who seek his services **Enemies:**
- **[High Priestess Scylla Deepdream]]** - Views his practices as perversions of natural death
- **[[The Waking Prophets** - His undead interfere with their communion with the living
- **The Resurrection Cult** - Fanatics who believe death should always be reversed
- **Life Domain Clerics** - See him as an abomination to be destroyed **Complicated:**
- **[Emperor Thalassius the Wise]]** - Officially condemns him but secretly uses his services
- **[[Prince Caspian Duskwater** - Morteus knows dark secrets about the prince's family
- **[Memory Merchant Valeria Siltweave]]** - They compete for contracts involving the recently deceased ## Quest Hooks 1. **The Forbidden Resurrection** - A noble family hires the party to convince Morteus to raise their heir, but he refuses, claiming the soul "belongs to something else now." Investigation reveals the heir made a pact with fiends before death. 2. **The Grief Plague** - Morteus's experiments with concentrated sorrow have created a supernatural plague that makes people die of sadness. He needs help containing it before it spreads beyond Aquabyssos. 3. **The Soul Garden** - Morteus offers to trade information about a villain's weakness in exchange for the party helping him "harvest" souls from a recent battlefield for his research. 4. **The Last Confession** - A dying emperor's final words were spoken only to Morteus. Multiple factions seek the party's help in extracting this information, while Morteus claims professional confidentiality. 5. **The Mourning War** - Two noble houses are using Morteus's services to weaponize their ancestral ghosts against each other. The party must stop the escalating supernatural conflict before it tears Aquabyssos apart. ## Motivations **Primary**: Understand and master the relationship between grief and death

**Secondary**: Provide "comfort" to the bereaved while advancing his necromantic research
**Hidden**: Prevent his own prophesied transformation into a lich by finding a worthy successor ## Roleplaying Notes **Personality**: Speaks in measured, funeral tones with genuine compassion for the grieving, but views death as a fascinating subject to study rather than a tragedy. **Ideals**: "Death is not the end—it is merely a transition. Those who understand this truth can find peace, even in the depths of sorrow." **Bonds**: "Every soul that passes through my care teaches me something new about the nature of mortality and the afterlife." **Flaws**: "I have become so fascinated by death that I sometimes forget the value of life. My pursuit of necromantic knowledge may damn not just myself, but all who trust me." **Voice**: Speaks in a soft, hypnotic whisper that somehow carries clearly underwater. His words are carefully chosen and often sound like funeral orations or religious benedictions. **Speaking Patterns**: - "In death, all things find their true purpose..."

- "The living fear what they do not understand..."
- "Grief is but love with nowhere to go..."
- "Let me ease your suffering—there are ways to speak with the departed..." **Mannerisms**: Always maintains perfect posture, as if conducting a funeral service. His hands move in subtle blessing gestures when he speaks. He has a habit of touching mourning jewelry worn by others, claiming he can sense the grief contained within. Water around him becomes still and dark, reflecting his emotional state. ## Player-Facing Summary The Sorrowmaster is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Sorrowmaster as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Sorrowmaster. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A noble needs help finding before the new moon
