## Lore Details

Legends speak of The Constitution of Depths as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Constitution of Depths.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties The Constitution of Depths to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
