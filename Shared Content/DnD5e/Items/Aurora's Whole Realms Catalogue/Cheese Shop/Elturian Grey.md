## Description
A heavy, whitish sheep cheese with black veins, Elturian Grey is also known as stonework or dwarfcheese. Despite such daunting names, the premiere cheese of Elturel is a tasty, pungent treat. I keep Elturian Grey in my own larder, and spring it on unsuspecting guests who complain about the trade cities. Now that the word of the delightful flavor of Elturian Grey has gotten out, a number of the other trade cities are producing their own versions. These tend to use cow’s milk instead of goat and are sold under similar names (Elturel Grey, Elturel Gray, etc. . . . ). Aurora’s only offers the original Elturian Grey. Available only in 1 lb loaves (6 sp).
