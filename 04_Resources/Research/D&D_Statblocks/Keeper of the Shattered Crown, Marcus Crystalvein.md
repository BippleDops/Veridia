*Former Knight, Shard-Corrupted Seeker* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Once a noble knight of [[The Crown|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/The Crown, Marcus Crystalvein has spent the last fifteen years searching for [The Seven Shards|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]] after discovering ancient texts about the [[The Crown of Stars. His obsession has physically transformed him - crystal growths now replace much of his left arm and shoulder, and his eyes glow with inner light when he speaks of the Shards. ### Keeper of the Shattered Crown, Marcus Crystalvein

*Medium humanoid (human, crystal-touched), chaotic neutral* **Armor Class** 16 (Crystalline Armor) **Hit Points** 142 (`dice: 19d8` + 57) **Speed** 30 ft. **STR** | **DEX** | **CON** | **INT** | **WIS** | **CHA**

--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------

(detects Shard fragments), passive Perception 18 **Languages** Common, Celestial (Crown fragments), Draconic **Challenge Rating** 11 (7,200 XP) **Proficiency Bonus** +4 ### Special Abilities **Legendary Resistance (2/Day).** If Marcus fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead. **Crystal-Touched Evolution.** Marcus's crystal corruption grows stronger over time. As campaign progresses, his abilities enhance but his humanity diminishes. **Shard Sense.** Marcus can detect Shard fragments within 5 miles, sensing their direction, approximate distance, and emotional resoce. **Crown Fragment Resoce.** Marcus carries three small Crown fragments that enhance his abilities. Each fragment provides +1 AC, +10 hit points, and access to additional spells. **Crystal Armor.** Marcus's crystalline growths provide natural armor and can be shaped into weapons or tools as needed. **Spellcasting.** Marcus is a 12th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save **DC 18**, +10 to hit with spell attacks). He knows the following spells: - **Cantrips (at will):** light, mending, prestidigitation, sacred flame

- **1st level (4 slots):** detect magic, divine favor, shield of faith
- **2nd level (3 slots):** augury, spiritual weapon, zone of truth
- **3rd level (3 slots):** beacon of hope, dispel magic, speak with dead
- **4th level (3 slots):** divination, freedom of movement, guardian of faith
- **5th level (2 slots):** commune, dispel evil and good, scrying
- **6th level (1 slot):** find the path, word of recall ### Actions **Multiattack.** Marcus makes two Crystal Blade attacks or casts two spells. **Crystal Blade.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`dice: 2d6` + 4) slashing damage plus 7 (`dice: 2d6`) radiant damage. The blade can extend up to 10 feet or split into multiple smaller weapons. **Shard Lightning.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +10 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (`dice: 4d6` + 4) lightning damage. If the target is a Shard bearer or magical creature, they must succeed on a **DC 18** Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of their next turn. **Crown Authority (Recharge 5-6).** Marcus channels the authority of the original Crown of Stars. All creatures within 60 feet must make a **DC 18** Charisma saving throw. Those who fail are charmed for 1 minute and compelled to listen to Marcus's words about the Crown's righteousness. Those who succeed are immune to this effect for 24 hours. **Crystal Prison (1/Day).** Marcus encases a creature within 30 feet in crystalline restraints. The target must make a **DC 18** Dexterity saving throw. On failure, they are restrained and take 9 (`dice: 2d8`) force damage at the start of each turn. The prison has AC 17 and 50 hit points. **Summon Order Knights (1/Day).** Marcus calls forth `dice: 2d4` spectral knights of his order (use knight stats with radiant damage instead of slashing) that serve for 10 minutes. ### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)

Marcus can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. **Move.** Marcus moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks. **Crystal Strike.** Marcus makes one Crystal Blade attack. **Shard Sense.** Marcus focuses his Shard detection abilities, gaining precise location of all Shard fragments within 1 mile. **Cast Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Marcus casts a spell of 3rd level or lower. **Crown Fragment Activation (Costs 3 Actions).** Marcus activates one of his Crown fragments for a powerful effect (teleportation, area healing, or mass charm). --- ### The Noble Knight's Fall
