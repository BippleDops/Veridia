You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart strikes a creature of your choice that you can see within range. A dart deals `1d4 + 1` Force damage to its target. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The spell creates one more dart for each spell slot level above 1.
