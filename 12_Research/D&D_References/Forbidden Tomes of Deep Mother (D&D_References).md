## Overview

These accursed texts contain knowledge about the Deep Mother, her servants, the nature of reality, and the coming transformation of existence. Each tome is dangerous not merely for what it teaches, but for how it teaches - the very act of reading these books fundamentally alters the reader's consciousness. They serve as both invaluable resources for understanding cosmic threats and potential paths to madness or enlightenment, depending on one's perspective.

### The Codex Abyssos
*"The Deep Mother's Own Testament"*

**Physical Description**: Bound in scales from creatures that never existed, with pages made from pressed water that somehow remains solid. The text appears in whatever language the reader understands best, but the words shift meaning as understanding deepens.

**Origin**: Discovered in the deepest ocean trenches, apparently written before any known civilization existed. Some scholars theorize it predates reality itself, existing as the original blueprint for creation.

**Contents**: 347 pages covering:

- History of reality as dream construct (pages 50-98)  
- Biological transformation processes (pages 99-147)
- Ritual instructions for awakening ceremonies (pages 148-196)
- Prophecies of the final awakening (pages 197-245)

**Reading Requirements**:
- Must be read underwater or while completely submerged
