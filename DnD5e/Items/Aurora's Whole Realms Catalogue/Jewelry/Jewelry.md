# Jewelry
## Overview
Let us not be mistaken: wealth and power are not the only motivations for battling dragons or turning to piracy upon the high seas. The desire for more and finer jewelry has made adventurers of many of us. Though I, for one, tire quickly of wearing other people’s cast-off bangles and beads, I never grow weary of wearing stuff that once lay beneath a dragon’s foot or in a pirate’s chest. Even so, such valuables can exact a high price on their pursuers (death), and are particularly troublesome in the company of some folk (thieves). Therefore, for the discerning customer, I have scoured the four corners of the Realms for the best in costume jewelry. From Kara-Tur to Anauroch, from Durpar to the Moonshaes, here are treasures fit for the royalty in your life.
