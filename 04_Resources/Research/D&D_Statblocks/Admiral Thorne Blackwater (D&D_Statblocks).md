Admiral Thorne Blackwater commands the [[Depth Wardens from [Pressure's End|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Pressure's End]], standing as the primary military force between [[Aquabyssos World Overview|Aquabyssos and the horrors of [The Hadal Depths]]. A veteran of over 200 deep patrols, his body bears scars from encounters with creatures that shouldn't exist. Pressure adaptation has made him massive - nearly 8 feet tall with dense muscle and bone structure. His eyes are completely black, adapted to see in the absolute darkness of the deep. ## History

Born in the early years after the drowning, Thorne joined the Depth Wardens at 14 after his family was killed by a deep incursion. Rose through ranks by surviving missions others couldn't. Led the successful defense during the "Night of Ascending Horrors" 20 years ago. Has commanded Pressure's End for the last decade. ## Current Activities

1. Preparing for massive assault from [[The Hadal Depths
2. Building secret weapon to destroy [The Deepmind]]
3. Training new generation of depth-resistant soldiers
4. Investigating disappearances in [[The Cerulean Trench|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Cerulean Trench]]
5. Planning potential coup if civilians fail to act ## Secrets

Admiral Blackwater's greatest secret is his slow death from pressure poisoning - a condition caused by decades of exposure to the deepest parts of the ocean. His enhanced physiology, while granting incredible strength and endurance, has also made him vulnerable to this unique affliction that affects only the most elite deep-sea warriors. ### The Ancient Enemy

*"Civilians see the ocean as blue and peaceful. I see it as black and full of teeth waiting to rise."* *"Every soldier under my command knows death is preferable to letting the deep horrors reach the surface."* *"Politics is a luxury we can afford only when the depths are quiet. They're never quiet for long."* *"My son thinks I'm a warmonger. When the Deepmind comes, he'll understand that some wars choose you."* *(To trusted allies)* "I'm dying, but the defense of Aquabyssos will outlive me. Make sure it does."* *(During crisis)* "Civilian authority ends where the deep begins. Down here, my word is law."* ## Player-Facing Summary Admiral Thorne Blackwater is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
