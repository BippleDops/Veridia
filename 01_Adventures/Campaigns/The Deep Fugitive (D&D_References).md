The Deep Fugitive is a mysterious individual who operates in the deepest trenches around Aquabyssos, evading capture by the city watch for crimes unknown. Their true identity remains a mystery, but their reputation as someone who can disappear into the crushing depths has made them a legend. This enigmatic figure serves as both a cautionary tale and a symbol of freedom to those who feel trapped by Aquabyssos's rigid social structure. ## Statistics

Little is known about the Deep Fugitive's past. Some claim they were once a royal guard who discovered corruption. Others believe they're a foreign spy. Most disturbing are rumors that they're a test subject who escaped from illegal experiments. What's certain is their ability to survive in the deepest ocean trenches where pressure would crush most beings, and their knowledge of Aquabyssos's hidden secrets. ## Known Associates
