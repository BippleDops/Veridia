# Ghostly Gaze
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 56*  

**Prerequisite**: Level 7

As an action, you gain the ability to see through solid objects to a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/senses#Darkvision|darkvision]] if you don't already have it. This special sight lasts for 1 minute or until your [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Concentration|concentration]] ends (as if you were [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Concentration|concentrating]] on a spell). During that time, you perceive objects as ghostly, transparent images.

Once you use this invocation, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Adventure Hooks

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
