## Description
The [[Light Splitter|light splitter]] sends out light; the telescope brings it in. With a glass in a tube, things that are dim are bright, and things that are far are close. Works like two magnifiers put together. The tubes pull apart and you can see far things. The tubes push together and you can see close things. 

Useful for looking at the heavens and the stars painted inside of them. Good too for the wanderers in the firmament and for the moon to see the creatures there. Helps commanders at back of army to see what happens at front. Comes with stand for 70 gp.

## Additional Details
quadruples distance and detail of vision at ranges over 100 feet; allows study of moons surface and planetary appearance
