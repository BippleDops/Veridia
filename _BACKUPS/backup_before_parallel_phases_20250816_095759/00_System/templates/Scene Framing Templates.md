Never start with 'So... What do you want to do?'"* --- ### The Discovery Open

**Setup**: Party arrives at scene of mystery```"The [LOCATION] is wrong. You know it before your conscious mind processes why. Maybe it's the [SENSORY DETAIL] or the way [ENVIRONMENTAL TELL]. But as [SPECIFIC PC] steps forward, they see it: [THE DISCOVERY].

What's your first instinct?" **Example**:

> "The Parliament chamber is wrong. You know it before your conscious mind processes why. Maybe it's the silence where there should be debate or the way shadows pool in impossible corners. But as Marcus steps forward, he sees it: Senator Glaucus is having a heated argument with an empty chair—and losing. What's your first instinct?" ### The Witness Open

**Setup**: NPC provides crucial information
"[NPC NAME] doesn't look like themselves. Their [PHYSICAL TELL] as they pull you into [PRIVATE LOCATION]. '[PC NAME],' they whisper, '[PARTIAL REVELATION].' Their shadow [SHADOW ACTION]. 'But that's not the worst part...'

They're interrupted by [INTERRUPTION]. Quick—how do you react?" ### The Evidence Open

**Setup**: Discovery of important clue
"You've been searching [LOCATION] for [TIME PERIOD] when [SEARCHER PC] finds it. Hidden inside [CONTAINER/LOCATION] is [EVIDENCE]. But it's wrong—
[CONTRADICTION/IMPOSSIBILITY]. As you process this, you hear [APPROACHING THREAT].

You have seconds to decide: take it, hide it, or confront what's coming?" --- ### The Ambush Open

**Setup**: Combat begins immediately
"Roll initiative. [PAUSE FOR ROLLS]

As [LOWEST INITIATIVE PC] [MUNDANE ACTION], the [LOCATION] explodes into chaos.
[ENEMY] erupts from [HIDING SPOT], [WEAPON/ATTACK] already in motion toward [TARGET].
[HIGHEST INITIATIVE PC], you see it happening—what do you do?" ### The Standoff Open

**Setup**: Tense pre-combat negotiation
"Weapons are drawn but no one's moved yet. [ENEMY LEADER] has [WEAPON] pointed at [NPC/OBJECT], while their [NUMBER] allies fan out, blocking exits.
'[DEMAND/THREAT],' they say, shadow twitching with anticipation.

The tension could shatter with a whisper. [FACE PC], they're looking at you.

Your words or actions will decide if this ends in blood or bargains. What's it going to be?" ### The Chase Open

**Setup**: Pursuit sequence
"You're running. Behind you, [PURSUER] [PURSUIT METHOD]. The [LOCATION] blurs past as you [MOVEMENT DESCRIPTION].

Ahead, the path splits: [OPTION 1] or [OPTION 2].
[ATHLETIC PC], you're in the lead—which way? Everyone else, what are you doing while running?" --- ### The Power Play Open

**Setup**: Important negotiation
"[IMPORTANT NPC] doesn't rise when you enter. They continue [POWER ACTIVITY] for exactly long enough to be insulting but not quite enough to justify offense.
'[OPENING STATEMENT/QUESTION],' they finally say, eyes finding [SOCIAL PC].

Their shadow, you notice, is [SHADOW BEHAVIOR].

The game begins. How do you present yourselves?" ### The Public Scene Open

**Setup**: Social encounter with audience
"The [SOCIAL LOCATION] falls silent as you enter. [NUMBER] faces turn toward you,
expressions ranging from [EMOTION] to [EMOTION]. You recognize [KNOWN NPC],
who [REACTION TO SEEING YOU].

Someone whispers, '[RUMOR/COMMENT],' just loud enough to be heard.
[CHARISMATIC PC], all eyes are on you. How do you handle this entrance?" ### The Confession Open

**Setup**: NPC reveals important information
"[NPC] waits until [PRIVACY MEASURE], then the words tumble out:
'[EMOTIONAL CONFESSION START].' Their [EMOTIONAL TELL] as they continue,
'[CRUCIAL INFORMATION].' They grab [NEAREST PC]'s arm.
'You have to [URGENT REQUEST].' Behind them, their shadow [CONTRADICTORY SHADOW ACTION].

How do you respond to this revelation?" --- ### The Threshold Open

**Setup**: Entering dangerous area
"The [LOCATION] boundary is marked by [ENVIRONMENTAL MARKER].

Beyond it, [ATMOSPHERIC DESCRIPTION]. Your [EQUIPMENT/SENSE] [REACTION].
[OBSERVANT PC], you notice [SUBTLE DANGER SIGN].

The last [TRAVELER/EXPEDITION] that went this way [FATE].

You're at the edge. Who goes first, and how?" ### The Discovery Open

**Setup**: Finding something unexpected
"You weren't looking for this. You were looking for [ORIGINAL GOAL],
but instead, [DISCOVERY PC] has found [UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY].

It's [ADJECTIVE] and [ADJECTIVE], and it definitely shouldn't exist here.

As you process this, [ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE] begins.

You have minutes, maybe less. What's your priority?" ### The Phenomenon Open

**Setup**: Supernatural event occurs
"It starts with [SUBTLE SIGN]. [SENSITIVE PC], you feel it first:
[SENSATION/PERCEPTION]. Then everyone sees it: [OBVIOUS PHENOMENON].

This is [COMPARISON TO KNOWN THING], but wrong, twisted.

Your shadows [SHADOW REACTION]. [LEARNED PC], you remember reading about this—what was it? And everyone, what's your instinctive response?" --- ### The Wrongness Open

**Setup**: Something is subtly wrong
"[NORMAL SITUATION DESCRIPTION]. Everything appears normal.

Except [PERCEPTIVE PC] keeps getting this feeling. Maybe it's the way
[SUBTLE WRONGNESS 1] or how [SUBTLE WRONGNESS 2].

Then you realize: [HORRIBLE REALIZATION].

How long has it been this way? And more importantly, what do you do now?" ### The Transformation Open

**Setup**: Witnessing change
"You watch it happen to [NPC/PC/LOCATION]. It starts with [FIRST SIGN],
barely noticeable. Then [SECOND SIGN], undeniable. By the time you realize
what's happening, [TRANSFORMATION DESCRIPTION].

They/It look at you with [CHANGED FEATURE] and [ACTION/STATEMENT].
[CLOSEST PC], they're reaching for you. Everyone else, you have seconds to act." ### The Revelation Open

**Setup**: Truth revealed
"'You want to know the truth?' [NPC] laughs, but it's wrong, hollow.
'The truth is [PARTIAL REVELATION].' They [DISTURBING ACTION].
'We've been [HORRIBLE TRUTH] this whole time. All of us. Even you.'

Their shadow nods agreement, independently.
[SKEPTICAL PC], the evidence is right there: [PROOF].

How does this change everything?" --- ### The Quiet Moment Open

**Setup**: Character development time
"For the first time in [TIME PERIOD], you have a moment to breathe.

You're in [SAFE LOCATION], and [COMFORT DETAIL].
[CHARACTER PC], [PERSONAL ITEM/MEMORY] catches your attention.
[ANOTHER PC], you notice [FIRST PC]'s expression.

What passes between you in this rare peaceful moment?" ### The Preparation Open

**Setup**: Getting ready for known challenge
"In [TIME UNTIL EVENT], you'll face [COMING CHALLENGE].

Your resources: [AVAILABLE RESOURCES]. Your concerns: [KNOWN PROBLEMS].
[STRATEGIC PC], you're coordinating preparations.

What's the plan, and how is everyone contributing?" ### The Recovery Open

**Setup**: After intense events
"The aftermath of [RECENT EVENT] still clings to you.
[INJURED PC] is dealing with [CONSEQUENCE].
[EMOTIONAL PC] hasn't spoken about [TRAUMA] yet.

You're in [RECOVERY LOCATION], temporarily safe.

How do you each process what just happened?" --- ### Investigation + Combat

"The bloodstain is still wet when the door explodes inward..." ### Social + Horror

"The Senator's smile doesn't reach their eyes—because their eyes are missing..." ### Exploration + Environmental

"The passage ahead branches into three, each glowing with different color bioluminescence.

That's when the earthquake—no, the muscle spasm—hits..." --- ### When You Need a Scene NOW (d12) 1. "Someone screams. It's coming from..."

9. "The building/ground begins to transform..."
10. "A memory that isn't yours floods your mind..."
11. "Everyone's shadows stand up simultaneously..."
12. "Roll initiative—but you don't know why yet..." --- ### Smooth Transitions Between Scenes **From Investigation to Combat**:

> "Your investigation bears fruit—bitter, poisonous fruit. The killer is..." **From Combat to Social**:
> "As the last enemy falls, you realize you're not alone. Watching from..." **From Social to Horror**:
> "The negotiation is going well. Too well. That's when you notice..." **From Horror to Downtime**:
> "Somehow, impossibly, you've survived. Hours later, safe in..." **From Downtime to Investigation**:
> "Your rest is shattered by [NPC] bursting in: 'They're dead! All of them!'" --- ## 📝 Scene Framing Checklist Before starting any scene:

- [] Know the scene's purpose
- [] Identify spotlight character(s)
- [] Have sensory details ready
- [] Prepare NPC voices/mannerisms
- [] Know potential outcomes
- [] Set stakes clearly
- [] Start in media res
- [] End with question/choice --- ### Never end with:

- "So what do you do now?"
- Complete resolution
- Everyone agreeing
- No tension
- Unclear stakes --- *Remember: Every scene should advance story, develop character, or raise stakes. If it doesn't do at least one, cut it and frame something that does.* **The perfect scene starts with a bang, middles with meaning, and ends with a gasp.** ## Player-Facing Summary Scene Framing Templates is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Scene Framing Templates as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Scene Framing Templates. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is searching for a witness for love
