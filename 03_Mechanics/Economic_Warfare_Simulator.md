# Economic Warfare Simulator

Markets as battlegrounds: supply/demand for 100+ goods, manipulation, sabotage, trade route risk, currencies, collapse scenarios.

## Market Model
- Goods: Crystal grades, pressure tech, memory pearls, anchors, foodstuffs, artifacts
- Price = Base × Demand/ Supply × Reality Modifier (from [[Complete Reality Merger System]])

## Manipulation Tools
- Buyouts, embargoes, counterfeit charts, rumor campaigns, anchor control

## Sabotage Operations
- Attack infrastructure (see [[Transportation_Infrastructure]]), bribe officials, infect parasites into supply chains

## Trade Route Risk/Reward
- Use [[Travel Event Table]]; add piracy and patrol modifiers from [[Fleet_Dynamics_Generator]]

## Currency Speculation
- Crystal notes, Memory credits, Anchor bonds; volatility spikes near mergers

## Collapse Scenarios
- Triggers: Anchor failure, Deep Mother cult strikes, plague waves
- Effects: Faction pillar shocks (see [[Complete Faction Warfare System]])
