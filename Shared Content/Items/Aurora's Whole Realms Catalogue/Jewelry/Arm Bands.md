## Description
Adjustable to fit any arm, these depict the fabled Serpent of Norland (westernmost of the Moonshaes), eyes blazing with garnets. Sold only in pairs. Special dwarven craftsmanship gives these arm bands a spring-like quality, which means unusual comfort for the wearer. Arm bands: 35 gp/pair.
