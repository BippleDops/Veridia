## Special Traits
***Assassinate.*** During its first turn, the assassin has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the assassin scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.

***Evasion.*** If the assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the assassin instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** The assassin deals an extra 13 (`dice: 4d6`) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 ft. of an ally of the assassin that isn't incapacitated and the assassin doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The assassin makes two shortsword attacks.

***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d6+3`) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (`dice: 7d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Light Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d8+3`) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 24 (`dice: 7d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Description
Trained in the use of poison, assassins are remorseless killers who work for nobles, guildmasters, sovereigns, and anyone else who can afford them.
