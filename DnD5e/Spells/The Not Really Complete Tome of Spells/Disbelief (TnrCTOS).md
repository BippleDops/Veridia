# Disbelief (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *8th-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
You convince yourself that as many as four objects or creatures or Huge size or smaller simply do not exist. Creatures you don’t believe in cannot harm or hinder you and you can pass right through them as if they were difficult terrain (you take 1d10 force damage if you end your turn inside a creature that doesn’t exist). Likewise, you cannot take action against a creature or ob-ject you don’t believe in.
