--- # Dead Magic Zone

*Environmental Hazard* A dead magic zone is an area where the fabric of magic is torn. The effect is the same as the [[Antimagic Field Xphb]] spell, except that it is permanent and typically covers an area no more than 300 feet in diameter. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 68* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Dead magic zone xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
