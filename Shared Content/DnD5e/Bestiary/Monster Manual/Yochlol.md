## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting.*** The yochlol's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). The yochlol can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: *detect thoughts, web*
1/day: *dominate person*

***Shapechanger.*** The yochlol can use its action to polymorph into a form that resembles a female [[Drow|drow]] or [[Giant Spider|giant spider]], or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

***Magic Resistance.*** The yochlol has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spider Climb.*** The yochlol can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Web Walker.*** The yochlol ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The yochlol makes two melee attacks.

***Slam (Bite in Spider Form).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. (10 ft. in demon form), one target. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d6+2`) bludgeoning (piercing in spider form) damage plus 21 (`dice: 6d6`) poison damage.

***Mist Form.*** The yochlol transforms into toxic mist or reverts to its true form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is also transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

While in mist form, the yochlol is incapacitated and can't speak. It has a flying speed of 30 feet, can hover, and can pass through any space that isn't airtight. It has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and it is immune to nonmagical damage.

While in mist form, the yochlol can enter a creature's space and stop there. Each time that creature starts its turn with the yochlol in its space, the creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target is incapacitated.

***Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day).*** The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.

A yochlol has a 50% summoning chance chance of summoning one yochlol.

A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

## Description
The yochlols are the Handmaidens of Lolth-extensions of the Spider Queen's will dedicated to acting as her spies, taskmasters, and agents of villainy. They attend their goddess in the Demonweb Pits, but Lolth sometimes dispatches yochlols to the Material Plane to guard her temples and to aid her most devout priestesses. Yochlols don't form outside Lolth's realm of the Demonweb, and they serve no demon lords except their queen.

Outside the Abyss, a yochlol can assume the guise of a female drow or monstrous spider to conceal its demonic form. In its true form, the fiend appears as a pillar of yellow slime with a single malevolent eye. In its drow and true form, a yochlol's touch carries the same venomous touch as its spider form's bite.
