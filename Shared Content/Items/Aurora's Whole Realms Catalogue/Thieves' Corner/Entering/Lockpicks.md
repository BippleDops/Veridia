## Description
In addition to the assortment of wires, rods, and angled wrenches common to lockpick sets, our expanded version also contains a funnel, magnifying glass, hammer, oils, acids, chisels—even a listening cone. We have never received a complaint about the effectiveness of our sets—at least not from the buyers.
