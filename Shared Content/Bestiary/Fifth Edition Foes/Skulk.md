## Description
Skulks are a race of humanoids that dwell on the fringe of other societies. They are a parasitic race—the humanoid equivalent of rats that survive by theft, subterfuge, and the occasional outright murder. Skulks are consummate cowards, sneaking into humanoid communities under cover of darkness to take what they desire but fleeing if they are interrupted or spotted. Skulks are physically very close to human in appearance, but they are hairless and lightly built with slender, graceful arms and legs. Their eyes are usually pale blue or pink.

In its “relaxed” state, the leathery skin of a skulk is a medium gray color. All skulks have a natural, chameleonic ability to vary their skin tone to match almost any environment. This gives them a tremendous ability to infiltrate areas with minimal cover and to “disappear” when the situation turns ugly, and they are almost impossible to track. They speak their own whispered language and the Common tongue.

Skulks have also been enslaved in great numbers by the warlike [[Skelzi|skelzi]] race, with whom they share their chameleonlike blending ability. These creatures live across all across the multiverse and in many nooks and crannies between the worlds.
