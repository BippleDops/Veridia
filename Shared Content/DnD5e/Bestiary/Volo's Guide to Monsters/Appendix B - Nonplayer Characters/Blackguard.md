***Multiattack.*** The blackguard makes three attacks with its glaive or its shortbow.

***Glaive.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (`dice: 1d10+4`) slashing damage.

***Shortbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d6+2`) piercing damage.

***Dreadful Aspect (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The blackguard exudes magical menace. Each enemy within 30 feet of the blackguard must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. If a frightened target ends its turn more than 30 feet away from the blackguard, the tar get can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Description
Blackguards are paladins who broke their sacred oaths and now indulge their own dark ambitions. They consort with fiends and undead, and they reject all goodly things from their former lives .
