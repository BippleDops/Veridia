# Original Glaucus Tidecaller
*The True Senator, The Forgotten Voice, Prisoner of Kelp*

## Overview
The real Senator Glaucus Tidecaller has been imprisoned in the [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Memory Meadows]] for three weeks, trapped within living kelp that slowly drains his memories while his shadow replacement [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Senator Glaucus]] takes his place in the [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Parliament of Echoes]]. Once a respected advocate for surface-depth reconciliation, he now struggles to maintain his identity as the kelp forest feeds on his past.

## Current Condition

### Physical State
- **Appearance**: Emaciated, pale, kelp strands growing through skin
- **Health**: Deteriorating, sustained only by kelp symbiosis
- **Mobility**: Bound by living kelp, limited movement
- **Voice**: Hoarse from calling for help no one hears
- **Eyes**: Still sharp with intelligence, desperate

### Mental State
- **Memory**: Losing 2-3 memories per day
- **Identity**: Clinging to core self, writing name repeatedly
- **Sanity**: Mostly intact but showing strain
- **Will**: Alternates between defiance and despair
- **Awareness**: Knows his shadow is free, feels its actions

## Background

### Before Replacement
**The People's Senator**
- Champion of surface trade relations
- Opposed isolation policies
- Investigated early shadow anomalies
- Respected across party lines
- Published treatise on diplomatic solutions

### Key Accomplishments
1. **Trade Reconciliation Act**: Nearly passed before capture
2. **Shadow Investigation Committee**: Founded it
3. **Depth-Surface Embassy**: His vision, never realized
4. **Humanitarian Reforms**: Improved conditions for New Drowns
5. **The Glaucus Doctrine**: Peaceful coexistence philosophy

### The Capture
**Three Weeks Ago**
- Investigating [[Reflection Pools]] at night
- Ambushed by [[Shadow Conspiracy]] agents
- Underwent forced shadow separation ritual
- Shadow gained independence and his memories
- Dragged to Memory Meadows while unconscious

## Imprisonment Details

### The Kelp Prison
**Living Bondage**
- Kelp strands pierce skin, create symbiosis
- Feeds him nutrients while stealing memories
- Grows tighter when he struggles
- Whispers his stolen memories back mockingly
- Slowly replacing his tissue with plant matter

### Daily Torment
1. **Dawn**: Kelp tightens, fresh memory extraction
2. **Morning**: Force-fed kelp nutrients
3. **Noon**: Visions of shadow's activities
4. **Afternoon**: Memory confusion, past blurs
5. **Evening**: Desperate attempts to remember
6. **Night**: Dreams of freedom, wakes to reality

### What He's Lost
- Childhood memories (mostly gone)
- Names of distant family
- Details of education

- Muscle memory for swimming
- Emotional connections weakening

### What He Retains
- Core identity and name
- Recent political knowledge

## Relationships

### Family
- **[[Marina Tidecaller]]**: Daughter, doesn't know he's replaced
- **[[Lysandra Tidecaller]]**: Wife, deceased (still remembers)
- **[[Marcus Tidecaller]]**: Brother, estranged

### Political Allies (Former)
- **[[Senator Aqueous]]**: Closest friend, might notice changes
- **[[Representative Coral]]**: Protégé, suspicious of replacement
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Scattered Emperor]]**: Knew his loyalty

### Enemies

- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Shadow Duchess Nyx]]**: Ordered his capture
- **[[The Memory Farmers]]**: Profit from his imprisonment
- **[[Kelp Cultivator Threnody]]**: His direct jailer

## Escape Attempts

### Failed Attempts
1. **Week 1**: Tried burning kelp, it regenerated
2. **Week 2**: Attempted to alert farmers, they're complicit
3. **Week 3**: Sent message via fish, intercepted

### Current Plan
- Preserving crucial memories by repetition
- Hiding small objects with his name
- Trying to contact daughter through dream resonance
- Saving strength for rescue opportunity
- Writing evidence in his own blood

## Information He Possesses

### Critical Intelligence
1. **Shadow Conspiracy Members**: Full list memorized
2. **Transformation Facility**: Exact location
3. **The Harvest Date**: When mass replacement begins
4. **Counter-Ritual**: How to reverse shadow separation
5. **Evidence Cache**: Hidden documents location

### Political Secrets

- Trade route sabotage plans
- Assassination targets

### Personal Knowledge

## Rescue Considerations

- Farmers will alert conspirators
- Physical therapy required

### Requirements
- **Medical**: Healer with plant extraction experience
- **Magical**: Memory restoration spells
- **Combat**: Defeat kelp guardians
- **Stealth**: Avoid farmer detection
- **Speed**: Extract before shadow responds

### Post-Rescue
- Will need protection from shadow
- Memory recovery could take weeks
- Testimony could expose conspiracy
- Daughter reunion complicated
- Political rehabilitation necessary

## Personality & Mannerisms

### Original Traits (Fading)

- Habit of tugging ear when thinking
- Always carried wife's portrait
- Never missed daughter's birthday

### Current Behavior
- Repeats name obsessively
- Scratches messages in earth
- Talks to kelp like old enemy
- Holds imaginary parliamentary debates
- Cries when forgets something important

## Quest Hooks

### Rescue Mission
1. **The Daughter's Plea**: Marina senses something wrong
2. **Anonymous Tip**: Map to Memory Meadows
3. **Shadow's Mistake**: Glaucus shadow slips up
4. **Emperor's Request**: Scattered Emperor needs real senator
5. **Kelp Whispers**: Plants reveal prisoner location

### Information Extraction
- Must retrieve his memories before too late
- Evidence cache could expose conspiracy
- Counter-ritual knowledge crucial
- Shadow weakness information valuable
- Political intelligence time-sensitive

## Speaking Patterns

### Before Capture
*"The depths and surface are not enemies, merely strangers who've forgotten they're family."*

*"Democracy flows like water—it finds its level through patience, not force."*

### Current State
*"I am Glaucus Tidecaller. I am Glaucus Tidecaller. I am... who am I?"*

*"The kelp knows my childhood better than I do now. It sings my memories while I forget them."*

*"Please... my daughter has a birthmark on her left hand shaped like a shell. Remember that. Someone remember."*

## Stats

### Current Condition (Weakened)
- **AS**: 10 (imprisoned)
- **HP**: 20/45 (deteriorating)

- **STR**: 6 (-2), **DEX**: 8 (-1), **CON**: 10 (0)
- **INT**: 16 (+3), **WIS**: 14 (+2), **CHA**: 12 (+1)
- **Saves**: Intelligence and Wisdom to retain memories

### If Rescued (Needs Recovery)
- Will require 1d4 weeks to regain strength
- Memory restoration necessary
- Political skills intact if memories recovered
- Combat capabilities permanently reduced
- Psychological trauma effects

## DM Notes

### Using Original Glaucus
- Ticking clock—loses identity in 2 weeks
- Rescue creates shadow confrontation
- His testimony could change everything
- Daughter subplot adds emotion
- Living proof of shadow conspiracy

### Memory Loss Progression
- **Day 21-25**: Loses distant past
- **Day 26-30**: Forgets acquaintances
- **Day 31-35**: Family becomes fuzzy
- **Day 36-40**: Recent events fade
- **Day 41+**: Complete identity loss

### Rescue Outcomes
- **Success**: Major blow to shadow conspiracy
- **Partial**: Rescued but memories gone
- **Failure**: Becomes part of kelp forest
- **Too Late**: Empty shell, no identity
- **Twist**: Shadow and original merge?
