# Midnight Tears
## Overview
*Midnight Tears (Ingested).* A creature that ingests this [[Poisoned|poison]] suffers no effect until the stroke of midnight. If the [[Poisoned|poison]] has not been neutralized before then, the creature must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (`dice: 9d6`) [[Poisoned|poison]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
