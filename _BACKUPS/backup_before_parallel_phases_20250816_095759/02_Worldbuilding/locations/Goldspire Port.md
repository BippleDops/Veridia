## Overview
Goldspire Port stands as the closest major Confederacy city to Aethermoor, a gleaming trade hub where [[Merchants, spies, and refugees mingle. Built into towering golden cliffs, the [City Watch]]es Aethermoor's crisis with calculating interest, serving as both potential salvation and threat.

## Description
The city rises in seven terraced levels carved into coastal cliffs of golden sandstone. Each level represents a different economic class, with mechanical lifts powered by steam and clockwork (deliberately avoiding [[Crystal Technology) connecting them. The harbor below bristles with ships from across the known world, while the summit holds the Confederate Trade Council's fortress-palace.

### The Seven Tiers
1. **Tide Ward** - Docks, warehouses, and sailor quarters
2. **[Merchant Quarter]]** - Shops, markets, and trading houses
3. **Craft District** - Workshops and guild halls (crystal-tech research labs)
4. **[[Embassy Row** - Foreign delegations and refugee quarters
5. **Gold Gardens** - Wealthy merchant estates
6. **Confederate Heights** - Government buildings and military
7. **The Spire** - Trade Council's palace and intelligence headquarters

### The Refugee Quarter
A growing district in Embassy Row where Aethermoor expatriates gather, bringing [Crystal Corruption]] fears with them. Heavily monitored by Confederate agents.

### The  Vault
Secret facility where confiscated crystal artifacts are studied and neutralized. Run by the Department of Existential Threats.

### The Market of Whispers
Information brokerage where intelligence about Aethermoor is bought and sold. [[Zephyr Goldwhisper maintains an office here.

## DM Secrets
> [!warning] The Confederate Solution
> The Trade Council has approved "Operation Goldfall" - if Aethermoor's corruption spreads beyond its borders, they'll implement total quarantine and bombardment. The city has massive crystal-ifying weapons ready to deploy.

> [!danger] The Economic War
> Goldspire is deliberately manipulating Aethermoor's economy to force annexation. They're buying up debts, creating supply shortages, and preparing to offer "aid" that comes with sovereignty-surrendering conditions.

> [!info] The Refugee Underground
> Not all refugees support the Confederacy's plans. A resistance movement called "Free Aethermoor" operates from the Refugee Quarter, smuggling supplies and information back home.

### The Crystal Museum
Displays "safely contained" artifacts from Aethermoor, propaganda tool showing Confederate superiority over crystal corruption.

### The Neutrality Towers
Massive devices that create a field preventing crystal energy within the city. Side effect: any corrupted individual entering experiences excruciating pain.
