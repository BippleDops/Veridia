## Special Traits
**Earth Glide:** The igniguana can move through any sort of earth or mineral except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. This movement leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of the igniguana's presence. It provokes an opportunity attack if it leaves a creature's reach while on the surface, but not if it does so while gliding through solid earth. The igniguana can't breathe while surrounded by solid stone or earth, so it can remain underground only for as long as it can hold its breath (15 minutes).

## Actions
**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (`dice: 1d4+2`) piercing damage plus 4 (`dice: 1d8`) fire damage.

**Fire Breath (Recharge 4—6):** Area Attack: automatic hit, range 20 ft. cone, creatures in cone. Hit: 9 (`dice: 2d8`) fire damage, or half damage with a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Underground, Elemental Plane of Fire

**Organization**: Solitary or group (2–5)

## Description
Igniguanas resemble lizards, though whether there is a true relationship or the resemblance is only coincidence is unknown. It’s been postulated that they could be relatives of the fire salamander.

An adult igniguana has a body that’s about 4 feet long, plus a tail that adds another 3 to 5 feet. It has reddish hide that flickers live embers and glowing eyes. They are undoubtedly elemental in origin, coupling attributes of fire and earth, as evidenced by their ability to crawl through solid rock without digging even faster than they move on the surface and leaving no tunnel behind to mark their passage. They can exhale small but intense blasts of fire even more frequently than most dragons, making them a bit more dangerous than their size implies.
