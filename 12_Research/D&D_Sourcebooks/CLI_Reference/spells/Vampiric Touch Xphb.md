# Vampiric Touch
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within reach. On a hit, the target takes `3d6` Necrotic damage, and you regain [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] equal to half the amount of Necrotic damage dealt.

Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, targeting the same creature or a different one.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d6` for each spell slot level above 3.

**Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]
