## Description
We offer many varieties of rope, from narrow strings useful for ornamentation up to massive ropes used aboard ships. All of our ropes utilize the optimum weave, from a triple braid in our [[String|string]] stock to a dual pentad braid. The widths of hemp rope up to 1 inch are shaved for easier handling.

At times, a smoother, lighter, or stronger rope is needed for a specific task. In these cases, silk is the best choice. Silk rope is easy on the hands and resists twisting and binding. All our silk ropes are woven by elven artisans.
