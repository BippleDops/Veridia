## Core Sanity Mechanics

### Sanity Points System

Every character has **Sanity Points** equal to their Wisdom score × 5. This represents their mental resilience against the incomprehensible horrors of the deep worlds.

**Starting Sanity**: (Wisdom Score × 5) + Background Modifier
- Sheltered backgrounds: +10 Sanity
- Worldly backgrounds: +5 Sanity
- Occult backgrounds: +0 Sanity (but advantage on saves)
- Traumatic backgrounds: -5 Sanity (but resistance to specific triggers)

### Sanity Damage Types

| Damage Type | Source | Save DC | Typical Damage |
|-------------|--------|---------|----------------|
| Existential | Reality contradictions | 15-25 | 2d6 |
| Visceral | Body horror, gore | 10-15 | 1d6 |
| Temporal | Time distortions | 12-18 | 1d8 |
| Identity | Self-dissolution | 14-20 | 2d4 |
| Cosmic | Incomprehensible truth | 18-30 | 3d6 |
| Parasitic | Mind invasion | 13-17 | 1d10 |
| Dimensional | Space warping | 15-20 | 2d6 |

### Sanity Thresholds

| Sanity % | Mental State | Effects |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| 100-80% | Stable | No penalties |
| 79-60% | Stressed | -1 to Wisdom checks |
| 59-40% | Disturbed | -2 to Wisdom checks, disadvantage on fear saves |
| 39-20% | Unhinged | -4 to Wisdom checks, roll on short-term madness |
| 19-10% | Breaking | Disadvantage on all mental saves, long-term madness |
| 9-1% | Shattered | Multiple madnesses, permanent transformations possible |
| 0% | Lost | Character becomes NPC, cosmic horror entity, or dies |

### Breaking Points

Characters have **Breaking Points** - specific triggers that bypass normal sanity saves:

**Personal Breaking Points** (choose 2 at character creation):
- Harm to loved ones
- Specific phobia realized
- Violation of core belief
- Loss of control
- Isolation/abandonment
- Body horror to self

When triggered: Automatic sanity damage (no save), double normal amount
