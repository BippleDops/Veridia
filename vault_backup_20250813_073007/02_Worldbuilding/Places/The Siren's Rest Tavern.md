# The Siren's Rest Tavern

*Where the desperate drink, the dangerous deal, and the wise listen carefully to the winds of fortune and misfortune that blow through every conversation.*

## Overview

The Siren's Rest Tavern stands as one of [[Port Crystalfall]]'s most notorious establishments, a three-story monument to maritime vice and questionable decisions. Located in the rough Dockside Quarter, just two blocks from the main harbor, it serves as an unofficial headquarters for smugglers, pirates, and anyone else who prefers their business conducted in dim corners with plenty of escape routes.

The tavern has operated under various names for over 150 years, surviving economic crashes, political purges, and at least seven different attempts by authorities to shut it down permanently. Its current incarnation began twenty-three years ago when **Captain Morgana "The Siren" Blackwater** won the establishment in a legendary poker game that lasted four days and nights.

The building itself is a testament to maritime architecture and dubious structural decisions. Originally constructed as a merchant's mansion, it has been extensively modified over the decades to accommodate its changing purposes. The result is a maze-like structure of interconnected rooms, hidden passages, and carefully planned sight lines that allow patrons to conduct business while maintaining awareness of potential threats.

## Physical Layout

### Ground Floor - The Common Room

The heart of the Siren's Rest is its massive common room, a dimly lit space that can accommodate up to 200 patrons when packed to capacity. The ceiling soars 20 feet overhead, supported by massive ship's masts that Morgana salvaged from wrecked vessels. These timber pillars are carved with names, dates, and crude maps marking the final voyages of doomed ships.

**Key Features:**

**The Main Bar**
A 40-foot-long construction built from the hull of a captured smuggling vessel, the **"Wayward Current."** The bar's surface bears scars from knife fights, fire damage from a raid gone wrong, and burn marks from the shadow crystals that provide the tavern's distinctive blue-green lighting. Behind the bar, dozens of bottles containing liquors from across both Aethermoor and Aquabyssos line reinforced shelves.

**The Hearth of Confessions**
A massive fireplace dominates the north wall, its mantelpiece decorated with figurehead carvings from ships that met unfortunate ends. Local tradition holds that confessing secrets near the fire brings good luck on one's next voyage, though what actually happens is that Morgana's network of informants carefully notes everything said within earshot.

**The Gambling Pit**
A sunken area in the center of the room surrounded by raised seating. This circular depression, originally part of the mansion's decorative fountain, now hosts card games, dice throwing, and other forms of wagering. The pit's acoustics ensure that conversations held there remain private, making it a favorite spot for conducting sensitive business.

**The Musician's Perch**
A small raised platform near the eastern wall where entertainers perform. The platform is reinforced to support heavy instruments and includes hidden compartments where sensitive documents can be stored during performances. The current regular performer is **Lydia Deepsung**, a half-elf bard with connections throughout the smuggling community.

**Booth Configuration**
Along the walls, dozens of high-backed wooden booths provide semi-private seating. Each booth is numbered with symbols rather than numerals - fish, anchors, crystals, and other maritime imagery. Regulars know that certain booth combinations create natural meeting spaces where multiple groups can coordinate without appearing to be together.

### Second Floor - Private Rooms

The second floor contains twelve private dining rooms and meeting chambers of varying sizes. These rooms serve multiple purposes: legitimate business meetings, clandestine negotiations, romantic assignations, and as safe houses for individuals who need to disappear for a few days.

**Room Classifications:**

**The Captain's Quarters** - Room 12
The largest and most secure private room, featuring reinforced doors, soundproof walls, and three different escape routes. Reserved for high-stakes negotiations and meetings between faction leaders. The room contains a massive oak table allegedly taken from an [[Aboleth]] lord's dining chamber, though this claim's veracity remains questionable.

**The Crow's Nest** - Room 8
A small, circular room at the building's corner with windows offering excellent views of the harbor approach. Used primarily by lookouts and information brokers who need to observe ship movements while conducting business. Contains a collection of spyglasses and signal mirrors for long-range communication.

**The Scuttlebutt** - Rooms 3, 4, and 5
Three interconnected rooms that can be rented separately or together. Popular with crews planning extended operations or groups that need space to spread out maps, cargo manifests, or other documentation. Each room has its own entrance, allowing for complex entry and exit strategies.

**The Lovers' Berths** - Rooms 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11
Smaller rooms designed for intimate conversations or romantic encounters. Despite their purpose, these rooms have witnessed numerous political assassinations, double-crosses, and business deals gone wrong. Room 7 is considered cursed after three successive occupants met violent ends within a month.

### Third Floor - The Observatory

The top floor serves as Morgana's private domain and the tavern's intelligence center. Officially, it's her personal residence and office space. In reality, it's a sophisticated surveillance and coordination hub for maritime criminal activities throughout the region.

**The Map Room**
Contains the most comprehensive collection of nautical charts in Port Crystalfall, including detailed maps of shipping routes, underwater hazards, and the locations of known [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Trade Union|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Trade Union]] deposits. Many of these charts show information not available to legitimate navigators, marking hidden bases, safe harbors, and profitable raiding locations.

**The Crystal Chamber**
A magically warded room containing Morgana's communication network - a collection of synchronized shadow crystals that allow her to maintain contact with affiliated operations throughout Aethermoor. The crystals are arranged in a circular pattern around a central focusing stone that amplifies signals and filters out unwanted interference.

**The Trophy Gallery**
Morgana's private collection of mementos from her adventuring days and significant tavern events. Includes cursed weapons, bottled storms, preserved sea creatures, and portraits of famous patrons who met memorable ends. Of particular note is the **Compass of Dead Reckoning**, which points toward the most recently deceased person within five miles.

**Living Quarters**
Despite her rough exterior, Morgana maintains elegant private apartments decorated with rare textiles, exotic artwork, and a library containing both practical manuals and forbidden magical texts. Hidden throughout the quarters are emergency supplies, weapons caches, and escape routes leading to the harbor through underground tunnels.

## Secret Features

### Hidden Passages

The Siren's Rest contains an extensive network of concealed passages built over decades of renovations and security improvements:

**The Smuggler's Run**
A tunnel system connecting the tavern's basement to three different locations: the harbor warehouse district, the old city catacombs, and [[Hidden Smuggler's Cove]] thirty miles up the coast. The main tunnel is wide enough for pack animals and small carts, allowing for discrete cargo movement.

**Wall Slides**
Several seemingly solid walls throughout the building can slide aside to reveal escape routes or hiding spaces. These mechanisms are triggered by specific sequences of actions (moving certain bottles behind the bar, adjusting paintings in the private rooms, or activating pressure plates hidden in the floor).

**The Priest Hole**
A cramped space behind a false wall in the second floor, originally designed to hide contraband. Now primarily used to conceal individuals fleeing law enforcement or rival criminals. The space includes basic supplies and a one-way peephole into the main hallway.

### Magical Protections

**Anti-Divination Wards**
The entire building is protected by subtle magical fields that interfere with scrying attempts and truth-detection magic. These wards were installed by a grateful wizard whose life Morgana saved during a [[Crystal Warden]] raid. The protection isn't perfect - skilled spellcasters can penetrate it - but it provides sufficient cover for most criminal activities.

**Alarm Network**
Concealed *alarm* spells throughout the building alert Morgana to unauthorized intrusions, though the system has been calibrated to ignore routine activities like drunken wandering or romantic escapades. The alarms connect to a master alert crystal in Morgana's quarters.

**Emergency Lockdown**
In extreme situations, Morgana can activate a comprehensive security system that seals all entrances, activates additional protective wards, and sends distress signals to allied organizations. This system has been used only twice in the tavern's history - both times successfully repelling raids by hostile forces.

- **Siren's Voice.** Morgana uses one of her charm abilities.
- **Attack.** Morgana makes one weapon attack.

**Description**
Morgana appears to be a woman in her early forties, though her true age remains a subject of speculation. She stands just under six feet tall with the athletic build of someone who has spent decades hauling rigging and wielding weapons. Her auburn hair often shows streaks of sea-foam green, particularly during storms, and her eyes shift color from deep blue to green depending on her mood and the lighting.

Her most distinctive feature is her voice - rich, melodious, and carrying just a hint of otherworldly resonance that makes people want to listen even when they know they shouldn't. When she laughs, customers often report hearing distant ocean waves, though whether this is magical influence or psychological suggestion remains unclear.

Morgana dresses practically but expensively, favoring dark leather and silk with silver accents. She wears her accumulated jewelry openly - rings, bracelets, and necklaces acquired through decades of profitable ventures. Each piece has a story, and she enjoys sharing those stories with customers she finds interesting.

**Personality**
Morgana presents herself as a gracious host and shrewd businesswoman, but beneath her charming exterior lies the calculating mind of someone who has survived thirty years in one of the most dangerous professions imaginable. She genuinely enjoys meeting new people and hearing their stories, but she also carefully catalogs every piece of information for potential future use.

She maintains strict rules about conduct in her establishment - no violence against staff, no theft from other patrons, and no business that could bring the Crystal Wardens down on everyone. Those who violate these rules find themselves permanently barred from the premises, often with additional consequences depending on the severity of their transgression.

Despite her criminal associations, Morgana operates according to a personal code of honor. She keeps her word once given, protects those under her hospitality, and has been known to provide sanctuary for individuals fleeing persecution - regardless of their ability to pay.

**Backstory**
Born to a fishing family in a small coastal village, Morgana first went to sea at age fourteen as a cabin girl on a merchant vessel. Her natural charisma and quick wit soon earned her advancement, but she discovered that legitimate maritime trade offered limited opportunities for someone of her background and ambitions.

She turned to smuggling in her early twenties, initially running small cargoes between coastal settlements. Her success led to larger operations, and eventually she commanded her own vessel, the **"Siren's Call,"** with a crew of twenty-three. The ship was lost during a storm while fleeing Crystal Warden pursuit, but Morgana and most of her crew survived.

Using her accumulated wealth and reputation, she won the tavern in the legendary poker game mentioned earlier. The previous owner, **Captain "Lucky" McGillicuddy**, had grown overconfident after a string of successful ventures and bet everything on what he believed was an unbeatable hand. Morgana's victory became the stuff of legend, establishing her reputation as someone blessed by fortune itself.

## Regular Patrons and Staff

### The Core Staff

**"Driftwood" Danny McReary** - *Bartender and Information Broker*
A grizzled former sailor who lost his right arm to a [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Trade Union|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Trade Union]]-corrupted sea creature. Danny can mix any drink known to maritime culture and several that probably shouldn't exist. He maintains the tavern's most extensive collection of rumors, gossip, and useful intelligence, trading information as skillfully as he pours ale.

**The Tidecaller Twins - Reef and Coral** - *Servers and Security*
Identical twin sisters of sea elf heritage who handle most of the tavern's day-to-day service. Despite their diminutive appearance, both are skilled fighters trained by Morgana personally. They possess an almost supernatural ability to anticipate trouble before it starts, often defusing situations through strategic drink placement and careful crowd management.

**"Ironbelly" Gertrude Saltwind** - *Cook and Quartermaster*
A dwarf woman who came to the tavern fifteen years ago fleeing debt collectors and never left. Gertrude can prepare hearty meals from almost any ingredient, including several sea creatures that most people wouldn't consider edible. She also manages the tavern's supplies and maintains connections with legitimate merchants willing to ask no questions.

**Marcus "The Silent"** - *Bouncer and Enforcer*
A massive man of indeterminate heritage who communicates entirely through gestures and expressions. Marcus lost his voice in a magical accident years ago, but his imposing presence (he stands nearly seven feet tall) and legendary fighting skills make him one of the most effective enforcers in the port district. Patrons who cause trouble often find themselves ejected from the premises with surprising gentleness - Marcus prefers to resolve conflicts without permanent injury.

**"Whisper" Jennings** - *Spy and Message Courier*
A thin, nondescript man who seems to blend into crowds and disappear from memory moments after being seen. Jennings handles the tavern's discrete communication needs, carrying messages between various criminal organizations and providing reconnaissance on law enforcement activities. His actual name, background, and loyalties remain mysteries even to Morgana.

### Notable Regular Customers

**Captain "Bloodfin" Rodriguez**
Leader of the most successful pirate crew currently operating out of Port Crystalfall. Rodriguez maintains an uneasy truce with local authorities by providing intelligence about larger threats in exchange for limited operational freedom. She typically occupies Booth 7 (The Anchor) every Thursday evening.

**The Gentleman Scholar**
A well-dressed individual of unclear identity who appears periodically to purchase specific types of information. Pays in rare coins from across both realms and always knows more about current events than seems reasonable for a tavern patron. Some suspect he represents the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Crystal Council|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Crystal Council]], while others believe he works for [[The Forgotten Court]].

**"Crosscurrent" Sally**
A smuggler specializing in moving people rather than cargo. Sally helps individuals disappear or assume new identities, and she maintains contacts throughout both legitimate and criminal communities. Her services are expensive but reliable, and she has never lost a client to pursuit or betrayal.

**The Chronicler's Assistant**
A young woman who claims to work for a scholar writing a comprehensive history of maritime trade. She asks probing questions about historical events and pays well for firsthand accounts of significant incidents. Many patrons suspect she's gathering intelligence for some unknown organization.

**Old Tom Tidewatcher**
A retired lighthouse keeper who comes to the tavern every evening to drink exactly three ales while telling increasingly elaborate stories about his service. While most of his tales seem purely fictional, careful listeners have noticed that his stories often contain accurate information about hidden hazards, secret caches, and forgotten maritime routes.

A complex dice game involving navigation calculations and weather prediction. Players bet on combinations representing successful voyages, shipwrecks, or profitable trades. Stakes typically range from copper pieces to hundreds of gold.

**Tuesday - Crystal Poker**
A variant of traditional poker using cards embedded with tiny shadow crystal fragments. The crystals react to the holder's emotional state, adding an element of psychological warfare to the standard game. High-stakes games have been known to involve ships, businesses, and even lives.

Players take turns moving pieces representing ships, goods, and authorities across a map of local shipping routes.

Morgana personally hosts high-stakes poker games limited to invited participants. Entry fees start at 100 gp, and the final pot often exceeds 5,000 gp. These games have determined the ownership of ships, the leadership of crews, and the fate of entire criminal enterprises.

**Weekend - Various**
Smaller games and casual wagering on everything from arm wrestling contests to storytelling competitions.

### Entertainment

The tavern features live entertainment most evenings:

**Lydia Deepsung** - *Regular Performer*
A half-elf bard whose repertoire includes traditional sea shanties, romantic ballads, and original compositions based on tavern patrons' adventures. Her performance of "The Ballad of the Wayward Current" (about the ship that became the tavern's bar) is considered a masterpiece of maritime music.

**The Depth Harmonics** - *Weekly Ensemble*
A rotating group of musicians featuring instruments from both Aethermoor and Aquabyssos. Their fusion of surface and deep-sea musical traditions creates haunting melodies that patrons claim can induce prophetic dreams.

**Storytelling Competitions**
