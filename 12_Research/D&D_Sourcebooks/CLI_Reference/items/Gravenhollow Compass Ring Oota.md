# Gravenhollow Compass Ring

This gold ring is fitted with a star ruby worth 1,000 gp. A [[detect-magic-xphb|detect magic]] spell reveals that the gem radiates a faint aura of divination magic. The gem's star-shaped core is a magical compass that guides the ring's wearer along the safest, shortest route to Gravenhollow.
