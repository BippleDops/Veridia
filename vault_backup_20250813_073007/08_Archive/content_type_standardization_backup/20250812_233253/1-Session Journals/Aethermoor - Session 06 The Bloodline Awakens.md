# Session 6: The Bloodline Awakens

> *One party member begins to crystallize, but unlike plague victims, the crystals form protective patterns.*

## üé¨ Strong Start

One party member begins to crystallize, but unlike plague victims, the crystals form protective patterns. Ancient memories flood their mind - they see [[Aquabyssos]] in its glory, and their ancestor helping to create the Seven Shards prison. [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]] arrives: "We have 24 hours. Your awakening has accelerated everything."

## üîç Secrets & Clues

6. [[02_Worldbuilding/People/High Inquisitor Maltheos|02 Worldbuilding/People/High Inquisitor Maltheos]]'s son is another bloodline carrier
7. The festival ground was chosen because it's directly above Aquabyssos
8. The original ritual can be inverted to seal the city permanently
9. [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn|02 Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]] is still alive and has the sixth shard
10. The Queen retains enough control to help if approached correctly

## üé≠ Cliffhanger Ending

With five shards gathered, the party races toward the festival. They arrive to find thousands of citizens already gathered, swaying in unison. The crystallized Queen stands at the center of a massive runic circle, the sixth shard floating above her. As the sun sets, she speaks in harmony with the crowd: "The Seventh comes. The circle closes. Aquabyssos rises." The bloodline carrier feels an irresistible pull toward the circle as their crystalline patterns begin spreading uncontrollably.

- How much to reveal about Aquabyssos
- Maltheos coup success level
- Faction alliance stability
```

## üé≤ Contingencies

- **If they miss shards**: Crimson Sage has emergency stash
- **If they take too long**: Festival begins early
