# Guardian Seal (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, M (pure beeswax, which is molded into a seal)

**Duration**: Until dispelled or broken


## Effects
You magically seal a door, window, box, or similar closure against one type of crea-ture: aberration, fey, undead, etc. If a creature of that type attempts to damage the seal, it is considered to have an AC of 20 and all of that creatureâ€™s attacks do half-damage.

The seal does not prevent that type of creature from damaging the area around the seal. If the seal was placed on the lock of a box, the creature can destroy the box. If it was placed on a door, the creature could destroy the walls around the door.
