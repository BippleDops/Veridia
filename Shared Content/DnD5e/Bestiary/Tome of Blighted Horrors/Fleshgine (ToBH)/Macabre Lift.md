# Macabre Lift
## Overview
*The dark shaft of the vertical tunnel appears to be empty until its wooden floor suddenly lurches and rises from where it rested. Beneath the planking of the floor, you can see that a great fleshy organism has grown like a distended bladder that covers the entirety of its underside. From this sweaty, rugose sac extend four muscular limbs that grasp the walls of the shaft with their multi-fingered appendages and begin to climb, carrying the cargo of its wooden flooring smoothly up the shaft.*

## Special Traits
**Berserk:** Every time the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] is injured in combat, roll `dice: d100`. If the result is less than or equal to the total number of hit points the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] has lost so far in this combat, its elemental spirit breaks free and the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] goes berserk. The berserk [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] attacks the nearest living creature; if no creature is close enough to attack with a single move, it attacks an object instead. The [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]]’s controller can try to reestablish control, provided the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] is within 60 feet. The controller must use an action to speak firmly and authoritatively to the construct and make a successful DC 15 Charisma check. A damaged [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] that spends at least 1 minute outside combat has its chance to go berserk reset to 0 percent.

**Crush:** A macabre lift can fall on foes beneath it as its move. Every creature under the lift takes `dice: 1d8` bludgeoning damage per 10 feet the lift fell, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Dex saving throw. Creatures that fail the saving throw are restrained under the lift; a restrained creature can escape by using an action and making a successful DC 16 Str (Athletics) check. Restrained creatures take `dice: 2d8` bludgeoning damage at the start of the lift’s turn.

**Heavy Floor:** The floor of a macabre lift is built from heavy wooden planks. Attacks against the macabre lift from creatures above it (such as passengers that were being raised or lowered in the lift) are made against AC 15, not AC 7.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] slams twice.

**Melee Attack—Slam:** +8 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d8 + 6` bludgeoning damage.

## Description
**Environment**: Urban (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Spells/PHB Spells/A-E/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary

One of the first [[Fleshgine|fleshgines]] envisioned by the golem-stitchers of Castorhage, the macabre lift has found widespread usage among government buildings and other large, multilevel structures with the budget to install such amenities. These constructs are rather simple in design, with a fleshy, leathery hide grown on the underside of a 10-footby-10-foot deck of heavy wooden planks. Four stocky limbs extend from the underside of the creature at its four corners and end with club-like pseudopods surrounded by a fringe of grasping fingers with thick, coarse nails. The entire [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] is no more than 2 feet thick but weighs 1,500 pounds or more (3,500 pounds if constructed with an iron deck).

Macabre lifts are designed to be placed in vertical shafts whose dimensions match those of the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]]. The [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] then lies flat at the base of the shaft and allows passengers to step upon its decking. Upon a signal —usually the ringing of a small bell set into the side of the shaft — the macabre lift begins to climb the shaft while keeping its deck level and stable. Handholds are often built into the walls of the shaft to make the climb easier for the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]], but its climbing pseudopods are so adept that it rarely needs any sort of assistance. The number of times that the bell is rung indicates to what floor the lift is supposed to carry its passengers. Likewise, bells set into the shaft at floors above summon it from below to pick up passengers. The rise and fall of the climbing [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] is so smooth that most passengers easily forget that they are riding upon the back of an animated construct.

If a macabre lift goes berserk, its usual tactic is to tip itself over to try to dump any passengers to the floor of the shaft below. Anyone riding the lift when it does this must make a successful DC 13 Dex saving throw to grab hold of the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]]’s deck and not fall.
