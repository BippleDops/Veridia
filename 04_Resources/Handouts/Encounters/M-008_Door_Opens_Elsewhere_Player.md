# Door Opens Elsewhere

The maintenance door opens onto a cliff under twin moons.

What you notice
- Night air that smells wrong
- Distant lights where no lights should be

What you can try
- Hold the door
- Tie a safety line
- Peek—or step through

Possible outcomes
- You close it and move on
- Something comes through
- You find a shortcut—or a detour
