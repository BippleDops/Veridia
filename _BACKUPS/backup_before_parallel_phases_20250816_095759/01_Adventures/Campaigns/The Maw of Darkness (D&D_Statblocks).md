--- # The Maw of Darkness **Type:** Horror/Exploration **Level:** 12-16 **Location:** [[The Hadal Depths, [The Cerulean Trench]], [[Abyssos Prime **Duration:** 4-5 sessions **Threat:** An ancient predator from before the drowning has awakened and begun consuming memories, souls, and reality itself ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Deep beneath [The Hadal Depths]], something that predates even [[The Deep Mother has stirred. Known only as "The Maw of Darkness," this entity feeds on the boundary between existence and void. Its awakening is causing reality tears, memory blackouts, and the gradual erasure of people from history itself. Even speaking its true name risks drawing its attention. ## Background

Ancient texts in reference a "Hunger That Devours Meaning" - something that existed in the spaces between thoughts before the world took shape. The [Great Drowning]] didn't create this entity; it disturbed its slumber in the deepest trenches. Now, as [[Aquabyssos has grown and prospered, the psychic "noise" of civilization has finally roused the Maw from its eons-long dormancy. ### Reality Distortion Effects

As the Maw awakens, its influence spreads: **Stage 1: Whispers (Sessions 1-2)**
- Citizens report hearing voices in languages that don't exist
- Minor memory gaps in daily routines
- Shadows behaving incorrectly (pointing wrong directions, missing reflections)
- Written records spontaneously changing or becoming illegible **Stage 2: Gaps (Sessions 3-4)**
- People disappearing from conversations mid-sentence
- Entire buildings becoming "forgotten" while still physically present
- Historical events changing in archives and memories
- Maps showing locations that no longer exist **Stage 3: Consumption (Session 5+)**
- Complete individuals erased from existence
- Concepts themselves becoming impossible to remember
- Physical reality developing "holes" that lead to primordial void
- The Maw begins manifesting directly in physical space ### Session 1: Strange Reports

**Location:** [Abyssos Prime]] **Objective:** Investigate initial reports of unusual phenomena **Strange Incidents:**
- **The Missing Speech**: A senator delivered an important address that no one can remember
- **Phantom Department**: Government office that everyone knows exists but can't locate
- **Temporal Bookkeeping**: Ficial records showing payments to non-existent vendors
- **Identity Crisis**: Citizens who remember having names but can't recall what they were **Investigation Methods:**
- **Archive Research**: Cross-reference historical accounts of similar phenomena
- **Witness Interviews**: Speak with affected citizens (while they still remember being affected)
- **Magical Detection**: Identify areas of reality distortion
- **Temporal Analysis**: Map when and where incidents occur ### Session 2: Into the Depths

**Location:** [[The Cerulean Trench, [The Hadal Depths]] **Objective:** Trace the disturbances to their source **Deep Exploration Challenges:**
- **Pressure Adaptation**: Surviving the crushing depths without specialized equipment
- **Void Pockets**: Areas where reality is thin and memory becomes unreliable
- **Forgotten Creatures**: Beings that have been partially erased but still hunt
- **Navigation Hazards**: Landmarks that change or disappear during travel **Discovery: The First Breach**

Deep in the trench, the party finds the original tear where the Maw first touched reality:
- **Circular Void**: A perfect sphere of nothingness suspended in water
- **Memory Echoes**: Fragments of erased experiences floating like debris
- **Forgotten Expedition**: Remains of previous explorers who tried to investigate
- **Warning Marker**: Ancient stone carved with protective symbols, slowly dissolving ### What It Is

The Maw of Darkness is not a creature in any traditional sense:
- **Primordial Hunger**: It existed before concepts like "existence" and "identity"
- **Anti-Entity**: It doesn't destroy things; it makes them never having been
- **Conceptual Predator**: Feeds on the spaces between thoughts and meanings
- **Reality Parasite**: Grows stronger as it consumes more of what "is" ### How It Feeds

1. **Initial Contact**: Touches the boundary of something's existence
2. **Erosion Phase**: Gradually weakens the target's "reality anchor"
3. **Consumption**: Absorbs the target into its own void-state
4. **Integration**: Uses consumed reality to expand its influence
5. **Propagation**: Creates new void-spaces to continue feeding ### You Cannot Fight the Maw Directly

Traditional combat is impossible because:
- **Non-Physical**: It exists in the space between physical and conceptual
- **Temporal Defense**: Attacks "never happened" if they would be effective
- **Reality Immunity**: It cannot be harmed by things that "exist"
- **Consumption Counter**: Attacking it provides more reality for it to consume ### What You CAN Do **Option 1: Conceptual Barriers**

- Use [[Seven Shards fragments to create "meaning anchors"
- Establish areas of "absolute truth" that resist erasure
- Create redundant memory networks so information survives partial consumption
- Build philosophical frameworks that define existence more strongly **Option 2: Sacrifice Strategy**
- Feed the Maw something so complex and contradictory it becomes "full"
- Use as bait
- Sacrifice abstract concepts (like "uncertainty" or "paradox") instead of real things
- Create a "logic bomb" that gives it intellectual indigestion **Option 3: Relocation Protocol**
- Don't fight it; remove everything it wants to consume
- Evacuate all conscious beings from its influence range
- Use [Temporal Navigation]] to shift timeline away from its awakening
- Collapse local reality and rebuild elsewhere ## Session 3-4: The Race Against Erasure

**Location:** **Objective:** Implement chosen solution before reality collapse becomes irreversible ### Conceptual Barriers Approach

**Challenges:**
- **Shard Acquisition**: Need to retrieve [[Seven Shards fragments from dangerous locations
- **Reality Engineering**: Create stable "existence fields" using makeshift magic
- **Population Protection**: Shield civilians from ongoing erasure effects

**Challenges:**
- **Bait Construction**: Create something complex enough to satisfy the Maw
- **Delivery Method**: Get the "sacrifice" to the Maw without being consumed
- **Containment**: Ensure the Maw doesn't just consume the bait and continue feeding
- **Ethical Dilemma**: What concepts are you willing to sacrifice forever? **Possible Sacrifices:**
- ****: All forgotten knowledge
- **Personal Identities**: The party's own sense of self
- **Abstract Concepts**: "War," "Hatred," "Fear" - removed from reality permanently
- **Temporal Paradoxes**: Feed it contradictory timelines that create logical loops ## Session 5: The Final Confrontation

**Location:** [[The Maw of Darkness - Conceptual Space **Objective:** Implement the final solution and survive the consequences ### Entering Conceptual Space

To reach the Maw's true "location," the party must:
- **Abandon Physical Form**: Exist as pure consciousness
- **Navigate Void-Logic**: Move through space that follows dream-rules
- **Maintain Identity**: Resist being forgotten by themselves
- **Communicate in Meta-Language**: Speak using meanings rather than words ### The Maw Encounter

The Maw doesn't "appear" so much as "become noticeable":
- **Presence**: A sensation of infinite hunger and ancient waiting
- **Voice**: Communicates through the absence of concepts
- **Form**: Visible only as the outline of what isn't there
- **Power**: Can retroactively change the party's past decisions ### Resolution Mechanics

Success is measured in "Reality Stability Points":
- **100 RSP**: Complete success, Maw returns to dormancy
- **75-99 RSP**: Partial success, Maw contained but active
- **50-74 RSP**: Pyrrhic victory, heavy losses but threat neutralized
- **25-49 RSP**: Tactical retreat, buy time for evacuation
- **0-24 RSP**: Total failure, reality collapse imminent ### Core Campaign Elements

- **[The Hadal Depths]]**: Deepest ocean regions where the Maw first stirred
- **[[The Cerulean Trench**: Major geographical feature affected by reality distortion
- **[Abyssos Prime]]**: Capital city experiencing memory gaps and erasure events
- **[[Aquabyssos**: The underwater realm threatened by conceptual consumption
- ****: Repository that may contain tools for fighting the Maw
- **[The Seven Shards]]**: Ancient artifacts that might power reality-stabilization magic
- **[[The Deep Mother**: Primordial entity whose relationship to the Maw is unclear
- **[Memory Tides]]**: Psychic phenomena that may be early signs of Maw influence
- **[[Shadow Surgeons Collective**: Organization whose memory work might help or hinder
- **[Parliament of Echoes]]**: Government body coordinating response to the crisis
- **[[Depth Wardens**: Military force losing members to erasure attacks
- **[The Singing Trenches]]**: Geological formations that may resonate with void energies

- **[Time]]**: Temporal refugee whose presence weakens dimensional barriers
- **[[The Lock**: Ancient barrier that may have contained similar threats before Connected Adventures
- **[Crystalline Depths]]**: Crystal intelligence may be another reality-consuming entity
- **[[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos**: Oracle's prophecies may have warned of the Maw
- **[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]]**: Political instability weakens society's ability to respond to cosmic threats
- **[[Rescue Senator Glaucus**: Political unity needed for coordinated response to existential crisis
- ****: Contains tools for fighting conceptual threats
- **[The Seven Shards]]**: Power source for reality-stabilization magic
- **[[The Deep Mother]]**: Reveals relationship between different cosmic threats ### Campaign Integration

- **Foreshadowing**: Plant early references to "forgotten things"
- **NPC Knowledge**: Some characters remember what others have forgotten
- **Reality Checks**: Regularly confirm what players think they know
- **Long-term Effects**: Some consequences persist throughout campaign > [!danger] DM Secret

> The Maw of Darkness is not truly defeatable - it can only be delayed. Every solution the party implements will eventually fail, but each buys decades or centuries of time. The real victory is recognizing that some threats require generational responses rather than heroic solutions, and establishing systems that future heroes can use to continue the fight. ## Player-Facing Summary The Maw of Darkness is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Maw of Darkness as a nexus where past and present converge.
