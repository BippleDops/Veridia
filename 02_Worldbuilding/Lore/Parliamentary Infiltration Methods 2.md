# Parliamentary Infiltration Methods
*The Shadow Government Behind the Government*

## Overview

The [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Shadow Conspiracy|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Shadow Conspiracy's most ambitious and successful operation involves the systematic infiltration and control of [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Parliament of Echoes]], Aquabyssos's primary governing body. Through a combination of replacement, corruption, blackmail, and ideological conversion, shadow operatives now occupy an estimated 34% of all parliamentary seats, with influence over an additional 28% of representatives.

This infiltration represents decades of careful planning and execution, transforming democratic governance into a puppet theater where shadow interests drive policy while maintaining the illusion of legitimate government. The operation's success lies not in crude takeover, but in subtle manipulation that makes shadow-influenced decisions appear to emerge naturally from democratic process.

## The Three-Phase Infiltration Strategy

### Phase One: The Foundation (15 Years Ago - 8 Years Ago)
**"Building the Shadows"**

#### Target Selection and Recruitment
The conspiracy began by identifying the most corruptible and ambitious members of parliament, focusing on individuals with exploitable weaknesses:

**Primary Targets**:
- **Financial Desperation**: Representatives with gambling debts, failed businesses, or family medical expenses
- **Personal Scandals**: Officials with compromising relationships, criminal histories, or moral hypocrisies
- **Ideological Extremism**: Politicians whose radical views could be weaponized for shadow purposes
- **Professional Ambition**: Career politicians willing to compromise principles for advancement

**Recruitment Methods**:
- **The Generous Patron**: Anonymous benefactors providing financial relief in exchange for "occasional favors"
- **The Blackmail Web**: Engineered compromising situations followed by photographic evidence
- **The Shared Vision**: Ideological alignment through carefully crafted philosophical discussions
- **The Gradual Corruption**: Small ethical compromises leading to larger moral failures

#### Early Influence Operations
Initial shadow agents focused on procedural manipulation rather than dramatic policy changes:

**Bureaucratic Infiltration**:
- Placement of shadow operatives in parliamentary staff positions
- Corruption of security personnel and administrative assistants
- Infiltration of record-keeping and archival departments
- Establishment of communication networks within government buildings

**Information Warfare**:
- Intelligence gathering on all parliamentary members and their families
- Development of comprehensive blackmail portfolios
- Creation of false intelligence reports to influence decision-making
- Establishment of propaganda networks within government communications

### Phase Two: The Expansion (8 Years Ago - 3 Years Ago)
**"Claiming the Seats"**

With infrastructure established, the conspiracy began systematic replacement of key parliamentary figures:

**Replacement Priority System**:
