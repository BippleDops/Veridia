## Description
This hollow metal tube measures about 1 foot long and weighs 1 pound. You can strike it as an action, pointing it at an object within 120 feet of you that can be opened, such as a door, lid, or [[Lock|lock]]. The chime issues a clear tone, and one lock or latch on the object opens unless the sound canâ€™t [[3 - Weapons|reach]] the object. If no locks or latches remain, the object itself opens.

The chime can be used ten times. After the tenth time, it cracks and becomes useless.
