--- # Alarm

*1st-level, Abjuration (ritual)* - **Casting time:** 1 minute unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bell and silver wire)
- **Duration:** 8 hours You set an alarm against intrusion. Choose a door, a window, or an area within range that is no larger than a 20-foot [[Cube Area of Effect Xphb. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a creature touches or enters the warded area. When you cast the spell, you can designate creatures that won't set off the alarm. You also choose whether the alarm is audible or mental: - **Audible Alarm.** The alarm produces the sound of a handbell for 10 seconds within 60 feet of the warded area. - **Mental Alarm.** You are alerted by a mental ping if you are within 1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you're asleep. **Classes**: [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 239.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of alarm xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around alarm xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A journal reveals a betrayal about this place
