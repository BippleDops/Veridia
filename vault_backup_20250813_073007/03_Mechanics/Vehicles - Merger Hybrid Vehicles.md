# Merger Hybrid Vehicles

Impossible vessels for zones where physics fails and timelines knot. Requires close coordination with [[Complete Reality Merger System]], [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]], [[Deep Mother]], and [[Memory Trading Economy System|Memory Trading Economy]].

## Impossible Vessels (Examples)
- Depth-Flyer (Underwater flight through air pockets)
- Pressure Crystal Ship (Solid-water hull; phase through liquid)
- Memory Vessel (Crystallized thought; crewed by consensus)
- Time Skipper (Arrives before departing; paradox fuel)
- Probability Sloop (Chooses the most likely safe path; consumes luck)
- Dream Barge (Sails the collective unconscious; anchor to lullabies)
- Paradox Engine Dreadnought (Powered by impossibility; must resolve contradictions)
- Echo Frigate (Exists twice; shares damage and repairs)
- Anchor Cathedral (Mobile stability fortress; sanctuary for minds)
- Eventide Courier (Moves at sunset in both worlds)
- Möbius Ferry (Deck wraps; infinite corridor combat)
- Palimpsest Ark (Overwrites local history to pass obstacles)

## Merger Navigation Systems
- Reality Compass: Points to highest Integrity area; jammed by Deep Mother pulses
- Probability Charts: Dice pools spent to alter encounter odds
- Sanity Piloting: Share party sanity as buffer; group breaks cause course loss
- Transformation Engines: Ship evolves to match zone physics; risk permanent change
- Deep Guidance: Bargain to receive routes in dreams; pay with memories or years

## Procedures
1) Identify zone type from [[Complete Reality Merger System#Merger Zone Classifications|Merger Zone Classifications]]
2) Select compatible vessel mode; allocate anchors
3) Choose navigation method (probability, memory, sanity, dream)
4) Roll stability, sanity, and paradox; resolve anomalies
