## Special Traits
***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the lemure's darkvision.

***Hellish Rejuvenation.*** A lemure that dies in the Nine Hells comes back to life with all its hit points in `dice: 1d10` days unless it is killed by a good-aligned creature with a bless spell cast on that creature or its remains are sprinkled with holy water.

## Actions
***Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2 (`dice: 1d4`) bludgeoning damage

## Description
A lemure arises when a mortal soul is twisted by evil and banished to the Nine Hells for eternity. The lowest type of devil, lemures are repugnant, shapeless creatures doomed to suffer torment until they are promoted to a higher form of devil, most commonly an [[Imp|imp]].

A lemure resembles a molten mass of flesh with a vaguely humanoid head and torso. A permanent expression of anguish twists across its face, its feeble mouth babbling even though it can't speak.
