## Special Traits
***Antimagic Susceptibility.*** The sword is incapacitated while in the area of an antimagic field. If targeted by dispel magic, the sword must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against the caster's spell save DC or fall unconscious for 1 minute.

***False Appearance.*** While the sword remains motionless and isn't flying, it is indistinguishable from a normal sword.

## Actions
***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d8+1`) slashing damage.

## Description
A flying sword dances through the air, fighting with the confidence of a warrior that can't be injured. Swords are the most common weapons animated with magic. Axes, clubs, daggers, maces, spears, and even self-loading crossbows are also known to exist in [[Animated Objects|animated object]] form.

***Constructed Nature.*** An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep. The magic that animates an object is dispelled when the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated object reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.
