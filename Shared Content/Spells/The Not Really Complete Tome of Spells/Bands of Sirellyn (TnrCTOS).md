# Bands of Sirellyn (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (three miniature inter-locked bands of silver)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


## Effects
You conjure a number of shining metal bands which encircle and capture a Huge or smaller target of your choice within range. The target may make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid capture. The escape DC is equal to 8 + twice your spell attack modifier.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this using a 5th-level or higher spell slot, the target has disadvantage on both the saving throw and the escape roll.
