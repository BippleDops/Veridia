# Evard's Black Tentacles
*4th-level, Conjuration*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/evards-black-tentacles.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tentacle)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in that area into [[difficult-terrain-xphb|Difficult Terrain]].

Each creature in that area makes a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it takes `3d6` Bludgeoning damage, and it has the [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition until the spell ends. A creature also makes that save if it enters the area or ends it turn there. A creature makes that save only once per turn.

A [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] creature can take an action to make a Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check against your spell save DC, ending the condition on itself on a success.

**Classes**: [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Fighter (Eldritch Knight)]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-aberrant-sorcery-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Sorcerer (Aberrant Sorcery)]]; [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Rogue (Arcane Trickster)]]; [[list-spells-classes-wizard|Wizard]]
