--- ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Economic Systems is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. Indeed, ## Lore Details Legends speak of Economic Systems as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Economic Systems. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Plot Hooks - Someone is blackmailing information for money

- A prisoner has gone missing and chaos spreads
- Strange sightings suggest ancient magic
- A noble needs help stealing before the festival ## References - [[Consequence Chain 2 - Crystal Trade Disruption

- [Economic System Rules (02_Worldbuilding)]]
