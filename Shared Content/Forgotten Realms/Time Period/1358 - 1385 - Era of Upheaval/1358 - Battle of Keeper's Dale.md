# 1358 - Battle of Keeper's Dale
## Overview
**Date**: Sunday, 1 January 1358 12:00:00 AM

After the [[1358 - Time of Troubles|Time of Troubles]], House Baenre led an army consisting of the [[Drow|drow]] of [[Menzoberranzan]] and their monstrous humanoid slaves in an attack on the dwarven stronghold of [[Mithral Hall]]. The dwarven defenders were assisted by allies from the cities and towns of Silverymoon, Settlestone, Longsaddle, [[Nesme]], and Blingdenstone. Following intense fighting both in the tunnels of [[Mithral Hall]] and on the surface near the city, the [[Drow|drow]] and their minions were defeated and forced to retreat to [[Menzoberranzan]]. During the battle, Bruenor Battlehammer, the King of [[Mithral Hall]] and a member of the group of adventurers known as the Companions of the Hall, was able to kill Yvonnel Baenre with the help of the other remaining members of the band: the [[Drow|drow]] ranger Drizzt Do'Urden, the human warrior Catti-brie, the halfling Regis, and the magical [[Panther|panther]] Guenhwyvar.
