*Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 72, Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 18* - **Alignment**: Lawful Good
- **Category**: The Mordinsamman
- **Domains**: Forge, Knowledge
- **Pantheon**: Dwarven
- **Province**: Primary deity of dwarves
- **Symbol**: Hammer and anvil The father of the dwarves crafted his children from metal and gems and imbued them with souls as he cooled them with his breath. Moradin is the master of every craft practiced by the dwarves and the patron of artisans. He expects his children to follow in his footsteps, studying his techniques and aspiring to one day match his expertise. Priests of Moradin are responsible for judging and assessing the work of a stronghold's artisans. They keep great volumes that describe various crafting techniques in detail, and use the guidelines in them to judge the quality of individual works. The priests also evaluate young dwarves to determine the youths' vocations. The decisions of the priests are accepted without question. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Dwarven moradin mtf is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
