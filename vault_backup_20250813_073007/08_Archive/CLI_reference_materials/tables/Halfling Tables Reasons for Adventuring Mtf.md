| dice: d6 | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Peeling taters and herding goats all the time wasn't your cup of tea. |
| 2 | You fell asleep on a raft one day and woke up near a human city. You were so thrilled with the strange sights and tasty food that you never turned back. |
| 3 | What started off as simple pumpkin pillaging from nearby farms turned into your becoming a wandering rogue for hire. |
| 4 | You talked to a nice faerie in the woods, and all of a sudden you were a thousand miles from home. |
| 5 | Your village elder told you so many stories about being a rogue in an adventuring party that you couldn't resist the urge to try doing it yourself. |
| 6 | A friend dared you to jump on the back of a sleeping horse, which turned out to be a pegasus, and your life hasn't slowed down since. |
