## Description
A perennial problem of being a thief is that any helmet must be removed to hear through doorways. Therefore, a gnomish inventor in Waterdeep devised this thieving helm, which not only protects the head, but also amplifies sound coming to a listener. They may look silly, but some of my friends swear by them. (10 gp)
