## Description
This is handy when you don’t have time to stalk and kill your own food in the wilds. Each meal is wrapped in waxed parchment, then wrapped in sackcloth and tied with [[String|string]]. There are a variety of combinations, but each meal includes a hard roll, a slice of dried cheese, some dried fruit, some seasoned jerky, and some sort of tuber or root vegetable, like a [[Potato|potato]] or turnip. These meals usually last for at least two weeks. 10 gp per week’s worth.
