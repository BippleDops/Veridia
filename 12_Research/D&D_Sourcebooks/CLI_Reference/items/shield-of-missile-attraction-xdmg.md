# Shield of Missile Attraction
*Armor ([[shield-xphb|shield]]), cursed item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/shield-of-missile-attraction.webp#right)

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Properties**: [[item-properties#Cursed%20Items|Cursed]]
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While holding this Shield, you have [[resistance-xphb|Resistance]] to damage from attacks made with Ranged weapons.

## Curse

This Shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by a [[remove-curse-xphb|Remove Curse]] spell or similar magic. Removing the Shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever an attack with a Ranged weapon targets a creature within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.
