## Description
One of the most important parts of any adventurer’s day is restful, healing sleep. Staying warm and dry is essential to getting a good night’s rest, so we offer a special adventurer’s bedroll that is easy to tote, yet durable and heavy duty. It is designed as a sack that is long enough to hold a human, with special eyehooks down one side for quick entrance and egress. The bedroll is multi-layered, with an outer layer of soft leather for waterproofing, and an inner layer of flannel cotton from Maztica for warmth and softness. In between, loosely spun wool padding creates a layer of insulation for superior warmth. It will keep you warm on some of the coldest nights, and you won’t lose any sleep over the price—just 20 gp. For the warmer climes, we also offer a thinner version, without the wool padding: 17 gp.
