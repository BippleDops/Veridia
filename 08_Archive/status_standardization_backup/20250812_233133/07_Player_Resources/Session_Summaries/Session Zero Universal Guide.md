# Session Zero: Aquabyssos Campaigns
## Setting Expectations for the Depths

*Before we dive into the drowned realm, let's ensure everyone is ready for the journey ahead.*

## üéØ Campaign Tone & Themes

### Core Themes Across All Campaigns
- **Transformation**: Physical, mental, and spiritual change
- **Identity**: What makes you "you"?
- **Moral Ambiguity**: No perfect solutions exist
- **Consciousness**: Individual vs. collective
- **Horror**: Existential, body, and psychological
- **Pressure**: Literal and metaphorical

### Campaign-Specific Focus

| Campaign | Primary Genre | Horror Level | Complexity |
|----------|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **Parliament of Shadows** | Political Intrigue | Medium | High (politics) |
| **Infinite Recursion** | Mind-Bending Mystery | Low-Medium | Very High (reality) |
| **Leviathan Prophecy** | Cosmic Horror | High | Medium |
| **Memory Wars** | Reality Manipulation | Medium | High (timeline) |

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Tools & Boundaries

### Content Warnings
We'll be exploring potentially sensitive topics:
- Body horror and transformation

- Drowning and suffocation themes
- Parasitism and infection
- Memory loss and manipulation
- Existential horror
- Political oppression
- Mental health struggles

### Safety Mechanics

#### The Depth Gauge
Like pressure, we'll monitor comfort levels:
- **Green** (0-30ft): All good, full speed ahead
- **Yellow** (30-60ft): Approaching limits, proceed carefully
- **Red** (60ft+): Stop, surface immediately

#### X-Card System
- **X-Card**: Stop this content immediately
- **Pause Card**: Need a break to discuss
- **Fast-Forward**: Skip details, summarize outcome
- **Rewind**: Redo scene differently

#### Check-Ins
- Start of session: Current comfort level
- Mid-session: Depth gauge check
- End of session: Decompression discussion
