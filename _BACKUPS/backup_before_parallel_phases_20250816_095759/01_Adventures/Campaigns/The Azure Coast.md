## Overview

The Azure Coast stretches along the western edge of [[Aethermoor, forming the continent's primary maritime frontier and its most prosperous trading region. Named for the distinctive blue-tinted waters created by underwater crystal formations, this 400-mile coastline serves as the main interface between the surface world and the underwater realm of [Aquabyssos]].

From the great port city of [[Port Meridian in the north to the lighthouse settlements of the southern capes, the Azure Coast represents both opportunity and danger. Here, surface [Merchant]]s trade with underwater diplomats, [[Pirates prey upon wealthy cargo vessels, and [Ancient Ruins]] emerge from the tides during the lowest waters of the season.
