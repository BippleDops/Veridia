Horrible creatures with grasping claws and distended jaws, hungry sorrowswornâ€”also known as the Hungryâ€”do whatever is necessary to sate their appetites. These greedy devourers stuff their maws with flesh and drink in their victims' screams. When they finish, they lurch away while their bright eyes resume the search for something else to consume.
