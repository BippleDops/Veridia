[[The Silverscale Consortium's flagship explodes in the harbor, raining crystallized gold across the merchant quarter. As the party races against the [Crimson Hand]] to secure ancient documents, Marina reveals her true heritage as an Aquabyssos descendant. The confrontation with [[Vex Shadowthorn unveils deeper conspiracies while [Director Silverscale]] offers a devil's bargain. ## [[Strong Start

> *Read aloud:* "The morning sky turns gold—not from sunrise, but from the Silverscale flagship '[Golden Promise]]' exploding in a shower of crystallized wealth. As fragments of transformed gold rain down, you spot [[Vex Shadowthorn directing [Crimson Hand]] operatives with surgical precision. Marina appears at your shoulder, her usual swagger gone: 'That ship was carrying something that wasn't supposed to exist—something from below. We need to talk, NOW.'" ### Location: [[[Silverscale Banking House]]

**[[Read Aloud:** *The banking house's magical security screams warnings as [Crimson Hand]] operatives breach the emergency vault. Crystallized gold from the explosion has somehow disrupted the ward patterns.* ### [[Skill Challenge: [Vault Heist]]

**[[Success Threshold**: 4 successes before 3 failures
- Each success: Recover one crucial document
- Each failure: [Crimson Hand]] gets closer to their goal
- [[Critical Success: Find secret compartment with [[[Aquabyssos Trade]] Seal]]
- [[Critical Failure: Trigger lockdown, trapped for 10 minutes ### Location: [[[Hidden Smuggler]]'s Cove]]

**Atmosphere**: Bioluminescent algae provides eerie blue-green light. Ancient stone architecture predates [[Port Meridian. Sound of impossible tides. ### [Critical Information]] Revealed

1. [[The Seven Shards were separators, not containers
2. Aquabyssos exists parallel to Aethermoor
3. The crystal plague is adaptation forcing
4. Marina's bloodline can navigate between worlds
5. [The Consortium]] has been looting Aquabyssos ruins for generations ### [[The Depth Guard's Map

Marina reveals a map showing:
- Seven lighthouse locations (dimensional weak points)
- Aquabyssos major cities' positions relative to Aethermoor
- Dates of "barrier thinning" events
- Location of the "[First Seal]]" beneath [[Port Meridian ### [Crimson Hand]] Attack

**Mid-conversation Interrupt**: [[Crimson Hand strikes the meeting
- 1 [Strike Team]] Leader (Veteran stats + spellcasting)
- 4 Operatives (CR 3 each)
- Environmental hazard: Collapsing sea cave
- Marina reveals water magic abilities ### Location: [[[Silverscale Emergency Bunker]]

**Security**: Antimagic field, construct guardians, escape tunnel to ships ### [[The Devil's Bargain

**[Options Presented]]**:
1. **Take the Money**: Gain wealth, lose Marina's trust, Consortium escapes
2. **Expose the Truth**: Gain allies, make powerful enemies, economic chaos
3. **[[Negotiate Middle Ground**: Partial disclosure, shared resources, tentative alliance
4. **[Forceful Takeover]]**: Combat option, seize Consortium resources ### Location: [[[Abandoned Consortium Warehouse]]

**Setup**: Following leads into obvious but irresistible ambush #### Pre-[[Battle Dialogue

**Vex**: "Marcus never understood. The power wasn't in containing the crystals—it's in becoming them. Just as those below became the water, we shall become the crystal. Evolution, not infection." #### [Combat Mechanics]]

> *Read aloud:* "As you emerge from the warehouse, every bell in [[Port Meridian begins tolling frantically. The normally reclusive [Queen Seraphina]] stands atop the palace, her body half-transformed by purple crystal. Her magically amplified voice echoes across the city:

> > 'Citizens of Meridian, the time of transformation is upon us. The surface world has failed. Below us lies paradise—Aquabyssos, the [[Drowned Empire, where death itself has drowned. In three days, at the [Crystal Festival]], we shall all descend together. Those who resist... Will sink alone.'
> Guard contingents begin herding confused citizens toward the festival grounds. Marina grabs your arm, her face pale: 'She's found it. [[The Seventh Shard. And if she uses it at the festival...' She doesn't finish. She doesn't need to." ## Connection to Aquabyssos
