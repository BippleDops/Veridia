# Port Meridian - Market Square

*"Where crystal light meets merchant gold, where voices of a hundred realms mingle in the ancient dance of trade and time."*

## Overview

The Market Square of [[Port Meridian]] stands as the beating commercial heart of [[Aethermoor]]'s greatest port city. This massive open plaza, spanning nearly three acres at the city's center, serves as the primary marketplace where merchants, travelers, and citizens from across multiple realms gather to engage in the fundamental activities of civilization: trade, communication, and the exchange of ideas.

More than a simple marketplace, the Market Square represents the intersection of cultures, currencies, and concepts that have shaped Port Meridian's identity as a cosmopolitan hub. Here, the crystal-powered innovations of Aethermoor meet the practical needs of daily life, creating a unique synthesis of advanced technology and traditional commerce that attracts visitors from across dimensional boundaries.

The Square operates under the ancient Charter of Fair Trade, established when Port Meridian was first founded, ensuring that all beings regardless of origin, species, or realm of citizenship may engage in honest commerce within its boundaries. This tradition has made the Market Square not just an economic center, but a symbol of the values that define Aethermoor civilization.

## Physical Layout and Architecture

### The Central Plaza

**The Grand Circle** (200 feet diameter)
At the heart of the Market Square lies a perfectly circular plaza paved with luminous crystals that provide gentle, steady illumination throughout the day and night. The central feature is the **Meridian Fountain**, a magnificent water feature crowned with a crystal sculpture that serves both as art and as a practical beacon for navigation.

**The Meridian Fountain** - This iconic landmark stands 30 feet tall and features a constantly shifting crystal formation that displays the current time, date, weather conditions, and dimensional stability readings. The fountain's water is infused with trace amounts of purified crystal essence, making it both beautiful and magically refreshing. The water flows in patterns that change throughout the day, creating different musical tones that serve as a subtle time-keeping system for the entire market.

**The Speaking Stones** - Eight granite pillars arranged around the fountain provide formal spaces for public announcements, auctions, and ceremonial occasions. Each stone is carved with the symbols of the major merchant guilds and enhanced with sound-amplification crystals that ensure speakers can be heard throughout the Square.
