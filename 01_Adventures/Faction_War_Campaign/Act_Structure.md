# Faction War Campaign

## Levels
3–12

## Paths
- Pearl Guard Ascendancy
- Syndicate Shadow Sovereignty
- Verdant Accord Stewardship

## Betrayal Mechanics
- Trust Track per faction (-3..+3). On a betrayal, drop 2 steps and trigger a Fallout Scene instead of stalling progress.

## War Council Sessions
- Agenda setting, motions, debate checks, and vote thresholds. Success yields military assets; failure yields rumor leverage.

## Mass Combat
- Abstracted fronts with Morale (0–6). Force checks each round shift fronts; supply and weather influence outcomes.
