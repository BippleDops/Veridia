# Encrypt (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *illusion*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of dust or fluff and a feather)

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
You render one message of 25 words or less permanently unreadable by everyone save you, one other specific creature named when you cast the spell, and anyone named in the message. This message remains indecipherable even to spells such as *comprehend languages,* although a *dispel magic* will remove the encryption. This message may be written on any media you wish and you do not have to be the original writer of the message.
