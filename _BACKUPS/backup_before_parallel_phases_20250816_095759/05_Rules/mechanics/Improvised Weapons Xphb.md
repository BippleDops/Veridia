An improvised weapon follows the rules below. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Proficiency Don't add your [[Proficiency Xphb to attack rolls with an improvised weapon. ## Damage On a hit, the weapon deals`d4`damage of a type the DM thinks is appropriate for the object. ## Range If you throw the weapon, it has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. ## Weapon Equivalents If an improvised weapon resembles a Simple or Martial weapon, the DM may say it functions as that weapon and uses that weapon's rules.
