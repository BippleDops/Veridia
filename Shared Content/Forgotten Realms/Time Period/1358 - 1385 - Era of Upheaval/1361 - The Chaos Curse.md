# 1361 - The Chaos Curse
## Overview
**Date**: Thursday, 1 January 1361 12:00:00 AM

At Castle Trinity, the headquarters of a sect that worshipped [[Talona]], the goddess of [[Poisoned|poison]], the wizard \[\[Aballister Bonaduce]], one of the leaders of the group, created the Chaos Curse, a vile potion that forced people to fulfill their most private desires without caution to the resulting consequences. Barjn, a cleric of [[Talona]] and one of the other leaders of Castle Trinity, took the Chaos Curse to the Edificant Library in the Snowflakes Mountains and unleashed the potion, which caused chaos to engulf the library. Some of the libraryâ€™s inhabitants escaped the influence of the curse in one way or another: Cadderly Bonaduce, a Chosen of [[Deneir]], the god of knowledge; the dwarven brothers Ivan and Pikel Bouldershoulder; the monk Danica Maupoissant; and the [[Druid|druid]] Newander. Cadderly and the others confronted Barjn and his undead minions in the catacombs beneath the Edificant Library. Cadderly and his companions killed Barjn and stopped the Chaos Curse, but Newander was slain in the fight against the evil [[Priest|priest]].
