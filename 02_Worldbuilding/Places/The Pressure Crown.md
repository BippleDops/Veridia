# The Pressure Crown

*Where the weight of the ocean becomes the crown of power*

> [!figure] Location Image
> ![Location Art](04_Resources/Assets/Generated/Locations/pressure-crown-palace.png)

## Overview

The Pressure Crown is an inverted palace suspended in the crushing depths of Aquabyssos, where extreme water pressure has been transformed into a source of magical power. Built by the ancient Mer-Folk Empire at the height of their civilization, this crystalline structure defies physics by growing stronger under greater pressure rather than collapsing. The palace serves as both a testament to lost engineering and a deadly trial for those who would claim its treasures.

The structure earned its name from the crown-like formation of pressure crystals that grows from its apex (which points downward into the abyss), channeling the ocean's weight into pure magical energy. Current scholars believe it was once a coronation site for deep-sea nobility, where only those who could withstand the pressure were deemed worthy to rule.

## Physical Description

### Architecture & Layout
The palace consists of seven inverted tiers, each one smaller than the last, creating a cone that points toward the ocean floor. Crystalline corridors spiral through the structure, their walls growing thicker and more translucent as one descends. The throne room sits at the very bottom, where pressure reaches near-lethal levels even for adapted beings.

### Environmental Features
- **Climate**: Perpetual cold, 2-4°C (35-39°F)
- **Terrain**: Suspended over a 3000-foot drop to the abyssal plain
- **Hazards**: Extreme pressure zones, unstable crystal formations, pressure ghosts
- **Resources**: Pressure crystals, deep pearls, compressed mana nodes

## For the Table

### First Impressions (Read Aloud)
> *Through the murky depths, a structure materializes that defies reason—an inverted palace of gleaming crystal hanging like a massive stalactite over an unknowable abyss. Its translucent walls pulse with inner light that grows brighter under the crushing weight of water. From its downward-pointing apex, a crown of crystalline spikes radiates outward, each one humming with barely contained power. The pressure here is palpable, making your ears ring and chest tighten with each breath.*

### Quick Hooks
1. **Immediate**: Pressure ghosts of ancient guards attack intruders
2. **Investigation**: Decipher the coronation rituals inscribed on the walls
3. **Social**: Negotiate with the Mad Hermit living in the upper chambers
4. **Combat**: Crystal guardians activate when treasures are disturbed
5. **Discovery**: Hidden vault containing the actual Pressure Crown artifact

### Fail-Forward Scenarios
- **If PCs ignore this location**: The Coral Throne Syndicate claims it and weaponizes its pressure magic
- **If PCs fail here**: They're expelled but learn the secret to surviving the pressure
- **If PCs succeed spectacularly**: They awaken the palace's true power, attracting every faction

### Scaling by Level
- **Levels 1-5**: Explore upper levels, pressure damage is 1d4 per hour
- **Levels 6-10**: Access middle tiers, face crystal guardians
- **Levels 11-15**: Reach the throne room, confront the Pressure Sovereign's ghost
- **Levels 16-20**: Activate the palace's reality-warping capabilities

## DM Notes

### Running This Location
- **Tone**: Ancient grandeur meets creeping dread
- **Pacing**: Slow pressure buildup, literally and figuratively
- **Key Decisions**: Trust the hermit? Claim the crown? Wake what sleeps below?

### Customization Hooks
- Make Aurelius genuinely helpful or secretly malevolent
- The palace could be a prison or a sanctuary
- The pressure effects could be psychic rather than physical

### Integration Notes
This location works as a major dungeon for mid-level parties or a quick smash-and-grab for high-level groups. The Pressure Crown artifact is crucial for the late campaign.

## Development

### If PCs Establish Base Here
- **Advantages**: Defensible, rich in magical resources
- **Complications**: Constant pressure damage, faction attention
- **Resources**: Ancient library, pressure crystal mine

### Future Events
- **Short Term** (1-7 days): Crystal parasites spread if unchecked
- **Medium Term** (1-4 weeks): Coral Throne expedition arrives
- **Long Term** (1+ months): Palace begins to collapse without maintenance

## Quick Reference

- **Population**: 1 (the hermit) + dozens of ghosts
- **Defenses**: Pressure barriers, crystal guardians, spectral defenders
- **Wealth Level**: Extreme (if you can extract it)
- **Corruption Level**: Moderate (pressure madness)
- **Faction Control**: Technically Parliament of Echoes, practically none

### Important Rolls
- **Navigation DC**: 15 to find, 20 to navigate safely
