In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you gain abilities useful for delving into ruins and getting maximum benefit from the magic items you find there. ### Fast Hands (Level 3) As a [[Action Xphb, you can do one of the following. #### Sleight of Hand Make a Dexterity ([skills#Sleight%20of%20Hand|Sleight of Hand]]) check to pick a lock or disarm a trap with [[thieves-tools-xphb (items) or to pick a pocket. #### Use an Object Take the [actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action, or take the [[actions#Magic|Magic action to use a magic item that requires that action. ### Second-Story Work (Level 3) You've trained to get into especially hard-to-reach places, granting you these benefits. #### Climber You gain a [Climb Speed Xphb]] equal to your [[Fly Speed Xphb. #### Jumper You can determine your jump distance using your Dexterity rather than your Strength. ### Supreme Sneak (Level 9) You gain the following Cunning Strike option. #### Stealth Attack (Cost: `dice: 1d6`) If you have the [actions#Hide|Hide]] action's [[conditions#Invisible|Invisible condition, this attack doesn't end that condition on you if you end the turn behind [Cover Xphb]] or [[Cover Xphb. ### Use Magic Device (Level 13) You've learned how to maximize use of magic items, granting you the following benefits. #### Attunement You can attune to up to four magic items at once. #### Charges Whenever you use a magic item property that expends charges, roll`d6`. On a roll of 6, you use the property without expending the charges. #### Scrolls You can use any [spell-scroll-xdmg (items)]], using Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for the spell. If the spell is a cantrip or a level 1 spell, you can cast it reliably. If the scroll contains a higher-level spell, you must first succeed on an Intelligence ([[skills#Arcana|Arcana) check (**DC 10** plus the spell's level). On a successful check, you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed check, the scroll disintegrates. ### Thief's Reflexes (Level 17) You are adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal [Initiative Xphb]] and your second turn at your [[Initiative Xphb minus 10. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Rogue xphb thief xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
