## Overview
Pressure Crush Zones are areas of extreme water pressure that exist at the deepest reaches of Aquabyssos, where even magically protected individuals risk catastrophic injury or death. These zones form naturally around abyssal trenches and artificial deep excavations, creating barriers that limit exploration and serve as natural defensive positions.

### Requirements
Occur at extreme depths where:
- Water pressure exceeds standard magical protection
- Dimensional instabilities amplify pressure effects
- Multiple pressure sources converge
- Natural or magical barriers fail

### Duration
Permanent environmental features requiring specialized equipment to traverse.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Zone Mapping**: Chart safe passages through crush zone areas
2. **Rescue Mission**: Someone trapped in expanding crush zone
3. **Zone Weaponization**: Military applications of artificial crush zones

## Campaign Use
Provides natural barriers and extreme environmental challenges for deep-sea exploration adventures.

## Player-Facing Summary

Pressure Crush Zones is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Pressure Crush Zones as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Pressure Crush Zones.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
