# Darkness
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, M (bat fur and a piece of coal)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, magical [[darkness-xphb|Darkness]] spreads from a point within range and fills a 15-foot-radius [[sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]]. [[senses#Darkvision|Darkvision]] can't see through it, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the [[darkness-xphb|Darkness]] to fill a 15-foot [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the [[darkness-xphb|Darkness]].

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of [[bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]] or [[dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] created by a spell of level 2 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
