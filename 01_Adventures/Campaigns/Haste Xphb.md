--- # Haste

*3rd-level, Transmutation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's [[Fly Speed Xphb]] is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to [[armor-class-xphb (variant-rules)]], it has [[Advantage Xphb]] on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used to take only the [[actions#Attack|Attack]] (one attack only), [[actions#Dash|Dash]], [[actions#Disengage|Disengage]], [[actions#Hide|Hide]], or [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action. When the spell ends, the target is [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] and has a [[Fly Speed Xphb]] of 0 until the end of its next turn, as a wave of lethargy washes over it. **Classes**: [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 284.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of haste xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around haste xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[Master_Spell_Compendium]]
