--- ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview Deep beneath the azure waters of the Deepmere Reaches lies the sunken city of Marina, once a magnificent naval port and center of learning that served as the crown jewel of an ancient maritime civilization. Marina was lost to the depths over three centuries ago during the Great Submersion, when massive tidal forces reshaped the very geography of Aquabyssos. While most assume the city was destroyed, recent discoveries suggest that powerful preservation magics may have kept sections of Marina intact beneath the waves. The quest begins when Archivist Nereon Deepcurrent of the Deepmere Scholars approaches the party with an urgent request. Ancient texts discovereded that reference a great library within Marina, containing navigational charts and magical knowledge that could revolutionize understanding of Aquabyssos's underwater regions. However, the exact location of Marina has been lost to time, and the waters above are treacherous with unpredictable currents and hostile sea life. The Scholars need experienced adventurers to locate the sunken city and retrieve whatever knowledge remains. What the party will discover goes beyond simple ruins. Marina was preserved not by accident, but by the deliberate sacrifice of its final inhabitants, who chose to bind their very souls to the city to protect its knowledge from destruction. The discovery of Marina will reveal not only ancient secrets but also the ongoing guardianship of those who died to preserve them. The quest will challenge the party to navigate both physical and moral depths, determining whether ancient knowledge is worth the price paid to preserve it. ### Act I: The Search Begins
