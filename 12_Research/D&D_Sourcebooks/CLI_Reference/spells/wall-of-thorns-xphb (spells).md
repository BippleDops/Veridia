# Wall of Thorns
*6th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of thorns)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a wall of tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The wall blocks line of sight.

When the wall appears, each creature in its area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `7d8` Piercing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters a space in the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `7d8` Slashing damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Both types of damage increase by `d8` for each spell slot level above 6.
