# Nimbated Creature
## Overview
### Nimbated Creature

[[yxf2cxyt.dxk.png|open outside]]

A humanoid creature that becomes host to a [[Nimb|nimb]] (see [[Nimb|Nimb]]) is transformed into a nimbated creature. A nimbated creature uses the base creature’s stat block, with the following differences:

**Incorporeal Double:** A nimbated creature gains an incorporeal double of itself. The double behaves much like a mirror image, copying the original’s movements exactly. It is not an illusion and is not automatically destroyed if hit, but is incorporeal (can move through gaps as small as 1 square inch without penalty; can move through solid objects and other creatures as if they were difficult terrain; takes `dice: 1d10` force damage if it is still inside something solid at the end of its turn). The double has the same defensive characteristics (AC, saving throws, etc.) as its original, but any damage done to it is applied against the temporary hit points (only) of the bonded [[Nimb|nimb]] instead. When the bonded [[Nimb|nimb]] has 0 temporary hit points, the double is destroyed. The bonded [[Nimb|nimb]] can choose to retain its last temporary hit point and lose normal hit points instead, to preserve the double. If the double is destroyed, a new one can be activated as soon as the bonded [[Nimb|nimb]] gains more temporary hit points. While the bonded [[Nimb|nimb]] has 0 or 1 temporary hit point, it can be seen on the nimbated creature as a vague, subtle outline, similar to a heat haze.

**Parasitic Bond:** An attached [[Nimb|nimb]] reduces its host’s Charisma by 1 each day, and the [[Nimb|nimb]] gains `dice: 1d6 + 2` temporary hit points at the same time.
