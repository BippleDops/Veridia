# Senator Glaucus Tidecaller
## Shadow Replacement

> *"Welcome to the depths where light drowns! Forgive me, that's not funny where you're from."*

## Description

### Physical Appearance
Senator Glaucus appears as a tall, unnaturally thin figure whose translucent skin reveals dark veins pulsing beneath. His eyes are completely black—no whites, no iris, just pools of darkness that seem to absorb light. When he moves, his shadow doesn't quite match his actions, often gesturing independently or remaining still when he walks.

### Personality
- **Public Face:** Overly welcoming, laughs at inappropriate moments
- **True Nature:** Calculating, serving the shadow agenda
- **Mannerisms:** Tilts head at odd angles, never blinks
- **Speech Pattern:** Oscillates between formal senate speak and dark humor

## Background

### Before Replacement
The original Glaucus was a respected senator, advocate for surface-depth trade relations, and opponent of isolation policies. He investigated shadow anomalies three weeks ago and disappeared for two days.

### The Replacement
Three weeks ago, Glaucus was ambushed at the [[Reflection Pools]] and underwent forced shadow separation. His shadow gained independence and replaced him, while the original was imprisoned in the [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Memory Meadows]]. The shadow retained all of Glaucus's memories but none of his morality.

### Current Activities
- Pushing for the [[Shadow Citizenship Act]]
- Identifying targets for shadow replacement
- Maintaining cover while serving [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Shadow Duchess Nyx]]
- Sabotaging investigations into shadow conspiracy

## Relationships

- **[[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Tenebrarum Ambassadors]]** - Fellow shadows working the political system
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Memory Farmers]]** - Collaborates in harvesting original memories

### Rivals
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Scattered Emperor]]** - Knows something is wrong but too paranoid to act
- **[[Original Glaucus]]** - Imprisoned but still fighting mentally

### Unknowing Associates
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Marina Red Tide Coralheart - Aquabyssos]]** - Suspects something but unsure of the truth
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Parliament Loyalists]]** - Still believe he's the original Senator
