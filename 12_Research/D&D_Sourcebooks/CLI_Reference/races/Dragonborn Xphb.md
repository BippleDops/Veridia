### Breath Weapon

When you take the [[actions#Attack|Attack]] action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in either a 15-foot [[cone-area-of-effect-xphb|Cone]] or a 30-foot [[line-area-of-effect-xphb|Line]] that is 5 feet wide (choose the shape each time). Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and [[proficiency-xphb|Proficiency Bonus]]). On a failed save, a creature takes `d10` damage of the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. This damage increases by `d10` when you reach character levels 5 (`2d10`), 11 (`3d10`), and 17 (`4d10`).

You can use this Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your [[proficiency-xphb|Proficiency Bonus]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]].

### Damage Resistance

You have [[resistance-xphb|Resistance]] to the damage type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait.

### Darkvision

You have [[senses#Darkvision|Darkvision]] with a range of 60 feet.

### Draconic Flight

When you reach character level 5, you can channel draconic magic to give yourself temporary flight. As a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]], you sprout spectral wings on your back that last for 10 minutes or until you retract the wings (no action required) or have the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] condition. During that time, you have a [[fly-speed-xphb|Fly Speed]] equal to your [[speed-xphb|Speed]]. Your wings appear to be made of the same energy as your Breath Weapon. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]].

## Description

The ancestors of dragonborn hatched from the eggs of chromatic and metallic dragons. One story holds that these eggs were blessed by the dragon gods Bahamut and Tiamat, who wanted to populate the multiverse with people created in their image. Another story claims that dragons created the first dragonborn without the gods' blessings. Whatever their origin, dragonborn have made homes for themselves on the Material Plane.

Dragonborn look like wingless, bipedal dragonsâ€”scaly, bright-eyed, and thick-boned with horns on their headsâ€”and their coloration and other features are reminiscent of their draconic ancestors.

## Player-Facing Summary

Dragonborn xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of dragonborn xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around dragonborn xphb.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
