--- # [[Retriever Mpmm

*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 209, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 222* The retriever is a potent, spider-like Construct conceived and built by Underdark followers of Lolth for one original purposeâ€”to prowl the Abyss and capture demons for these cultists to enslave or use in their rituals. The automatons proved so effective and so fearsome that they now perform many different missions. Though retrievers were created to operate only in the Abyss, they are sometimes dispatched when a powerful devotee of Lolth needs some creature or object captured and brought back alive and intact. Only under the rarest of circumstances is a retriever handed over or sold to others, since Lolth's cultists don't want to take the chance that their creations will be turned against them.```statblock
