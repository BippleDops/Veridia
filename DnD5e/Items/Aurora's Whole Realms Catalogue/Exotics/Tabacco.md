## Description
Dark and sweet-scented, this Nexalan leaf can be used for the same purposes as common pipeweed. However, there all comparison ends, for pipeweed cannot match the rich, full flavors of true Nexalan tabacco (or tobacco). I sell only the finest tabacco, imported directly from Nexal and packed in sealed pots to retain all its true flavor. Every pot comes with a complimentary churchwarden so that you need not delay your enjoyment. (100 gp/lb.)
