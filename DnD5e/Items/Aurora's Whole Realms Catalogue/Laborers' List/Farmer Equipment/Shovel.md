## Description
A farmerâ€™s main weapons in battling the land, shovels come in as many varieties as do swords. All our shovels have maplewood handles, solid steel spades, and smith-sharpened, fire-hardened tips. We offer a gardening shovel (3 gp), coal shovel (2 gp), postholer (4 gp), snowshovel (3 gp), and a hand spade (2 sp). Shovels make great mob weapons.
