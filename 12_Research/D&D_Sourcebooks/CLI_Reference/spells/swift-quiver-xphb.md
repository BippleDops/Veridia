*5th-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a Quiver worth 1+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

When you cast the spell and as a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] until it ends, you can make two attacks with a weapon that fires Arrows or Bolts, such as a Longbow or a Light Crossbow. The spell magically creates the ammunition needed for each attack. Each Arrow or Bolt created by the spell deals damage like a nonmagical piece of ammunition of its kind and disintegrates immediately after it hits or misses.
