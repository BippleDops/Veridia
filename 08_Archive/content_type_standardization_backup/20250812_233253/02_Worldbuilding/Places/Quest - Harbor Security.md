Legends speak of Quest   Harbor Security as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Quest   Harbor Security.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Quest   Harbor Security to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
