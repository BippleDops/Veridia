--- # Conjure Fey

*6th-level, Conjuration* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes You conjure a Medium spirit from the Feywild in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The spirit lasts for the duration, and it looks like a Fey creature of your choice. When the spirit appears, you can make one melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes Psychic damage equal to``dice: 3d12``plus your spellcasting ability modifier, and the target has the [[conditions#frightened|Frightened condition until the start of your next turn, with both you and the spirit as the source of the fear. As a [Action Xphb]] on your later turns, you can teleport the spirit to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of the space it left and make the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by`d12`for each spell slot level above 6. **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 255.
