## Special Traits

**Regeneration:** At the start of its turn, a denizen of Leng regains 5 lost hit points. This ability fails to function only if the creature is utterly cut off from Leng; e.g., if its ability to plane shift is negated. If a denizen of Leng is reduced to 0 hit points while it is still capable of regenerating, its body dissipates into vapor in `dice: 1d4` rounds, leaving only its clothing and equipment behind, and it returns to life on Leng.

**Sneak Attack:** Once per turn, a denizen of Leng can do an extra 14 (`dice: 4d6`) damage with a claw or bite attack if the denizen has advantage on the attack or if one of its allies is within 5 feet of the target.

**Spell-like Abilities:** A denizen of Leng can use the following spell-like abilities, using Charisma as its casting ability (DC 16, attack +8). A denizen of Leng doesn’t need material components to use these abilities.

- Constant: *tongues*

- 3/day: *detect thoughts, hypnotic pattern, levitate, minor image*

- 1/day: *locate object, plane shift (self only)*

## Actions

**Multiattack:** A denizen of Leng bites once and attacks once with claws.

**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (`dice: 1d8+4`) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or immediately gain one level of exhaustion.

**Claws:** *Melee Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (`dice: 1d8+4`) slashing damage.

## Ecology

**Environment**: Any land

**Organization**: Solitary, gang (2–5), or crew (6–15)

## Description

Denizens of Leng are remote, alien, and inscrutable, much like their distant, wellhidden home realm. Scholars argue endlessly over whether Leng is a physical realm like other planes— secreted among the Outer Planes, according to some—or a more ephemeral dimension of dreams and shadows. What is known for certain is that its native inhabitants can travel freely among the planes, both individually using an innate power and also aboard great black-sailed ships. They venture out in search of exotic slaves, magic items, and gems, for which they have an insatiable greed. Gems always make up the greatest portion of their treasure. It is also known that the denizens of Leng are involved in an ages-old war against the monstrous, intelligent spiders that infest their homeland.

Travelers from Leng always go abroad in voluminous robes and head-wrappings similar to those of desert people, to disguise their true origin. In their disguises, they can readily pass as elves or short humans. Stripped of their robes and hoods, they reveal horned brows, clawed fingers, mouths ringed by tentacles, and cloven, doublejointed legs like a goat’s.
