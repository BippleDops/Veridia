# The Leviathan Prophets

*"When the Great Deep stirs, only those who listen to its whispers shall survive." - First Prophet Thalassa*

## Overview
The Leviathan Prophets are a mysterious cult devoted to ancient sea creatures of immense power, believing these beings hold the keys to Aquabyssos's ultimate destiny. They interpret the movements of deep-sea leviathans as divine messages, predicting everything from political upheavals to natural disasters. Operating from hidden shrines throughout the city's deepest districts, they maintain that only through communion with these ancient entities can the city achieve true greatness.

Founded after the Great Stirring, when massive creatures were spotted in the deepest trenches, the Prophets claim direct spiritual connection to beings older than civilization itself. They view themselves as interpreters of an ancient covenant between the leviathans and the underwater realm.

## Structure and Beliefs

**Deep Speakers:** High-ranking members who interpret major prophecies
**Tide Readers:** Mid-level prophets specializing in specific types of divination
**Current Touched:** Initiates undergoing spiritual transformation
**The Awakened:** Former members who achieved "true sight"

### Core Doctrines
- Leviathans are divine guardians of the deep realms
- Their movements predict future events with absolute accuracy
- Only through sacrifice and devotion can one gain prophetic sight
- The coming "Great Awakening" will transform all ocean life
- Surface dwellers are spiritually inferior due to separation from the depths

## Prophetic Practices

## Activities and Influence
The Prophets operate an extensive network of informants who report unusual phenomena, seeking validation for their predictions.

Some members hold positions in government and religious institutions, subtly promoting leviathan-favorable policies.
