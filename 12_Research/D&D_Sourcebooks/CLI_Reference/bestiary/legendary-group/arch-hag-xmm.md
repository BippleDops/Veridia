# Arch-hag

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing an arch-hag's lair is altered by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Lapsus Linguae.** Creatures (excluding the hag and its allies) within 1 mile of the lair subtract `d10` from any ability check they make when they take the [[actions#Influence|Influence]] action.  
- **Meddlesome Magic.** Whenever a creature other than the hag or its allies finishes a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]] while within 1 mile of the lair, the next time that creature casts a spell using a spell slot, it also casts [[confusion-xphb|Confusion]] centered on itself. The spell uses the creature's spellcasting ability and doesn't require [[conditions#Concentration|Concentration]].  

If the arch-hag is destroyed or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
