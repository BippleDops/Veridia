- Mutual non-aggression pacts
- The sacred [[The Coral Throne|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Coral Throne as a neutral meeting ground
- Ritualistic renewal ceremonies every century The accords were sealed with powerful magic, binding both realms to honor their terms. But now the throne lies shattered, and ancient powers stir in the depths. Therefore, ### The Inciting Incident
