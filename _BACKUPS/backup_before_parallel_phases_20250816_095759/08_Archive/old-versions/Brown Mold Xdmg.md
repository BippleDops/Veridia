--- # Brown Mold

*Generic Hazard* Brown mold resembles a furry, light-brown carpet. This fungus feeds on warmth, drawing heat from anything around itself. One patch of brown mold covers a 10-foot square, and the temperature within 30 feet of it is always frigid. When a creature enters a space within 5 feet of the mold for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature makes a **DC 12** Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (``dice: 4d10``) Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Brown mold has [[immunity-xphb (variant-rules) to Fire damage, and any source of fire brought within 5 feet of it causes the mold to instantly expand across a surface and toward the fire, creating a new patch that covers a 10-foot square. A patch of brown mold exposed to an effect that deals any amount of Cold damage is destroyed instantly. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 76* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Brown mold xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
