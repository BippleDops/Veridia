## Description
Even more valuable than their mutton, the wool that lambs produce keeps us all warm and comfortable. Our shearing pack includes a soft leather thong to hold the lamb’s legs during the shearing and a gnomish contraption called a “biter.” Drawing the biter’s handles together causes the clamp to fasten down upon the wool and “bite” off a clump of it. The biter is shielded so it will not cut the sheep’s skin, and leaves enough wool to protect the hide beneath. (15 gp)

## Additional Details
Biter (with shield removed): Wt 7 lb; S M; Typ P/S; Spd Fctr 10; Dmg `dice: 1d6`/1d6; Hit Prob. -1
