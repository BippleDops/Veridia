# Singer Consciousness

*"When voices unite in perfect harmony, individual minds become one song."*

## Overview
Singer Consciousness refers to the collective mental state achieved when multiple individuals synchronize their thoughts through musical harmony. This phenomenon allows groups to share memories, emotions, and even magical abilities through sustained vocal coordination, creating a temporary hive mind that can accomplish feats impossible for individuals.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
- Multiple participants with vocal training
- Synchronized breathing and pitch control
- Mental openness and trust between singers
- Sustained musical harmony for activation

### Effects
- **Shared Thoughts**: Telepathic communication between singers
- **Memory Pooling**: Access to all participants' knowledge
- **Amplified Magic**: Enhanced spellcasting through group focus
- **Collective Problem Solving**: Superior analytical capabilities

### Duration
Maintained as long as harmony continues, typically minutes to hours.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Harmony Disruption**: External force breaks dangerous consciousness event
2. **Forced Unity**: Characters trapped in unwilling consciousness merge
3. **Choir Investigation**: Mysterious singing group operates with suspicious coordination

## Campaign Use
Provides unique roleplay opportunities and challenges involving collective identity and shared responsibility.
