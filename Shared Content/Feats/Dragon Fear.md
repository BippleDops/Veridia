# Dragon Fear

## Overview

When angered, you can radiate menace. You gain the following benefits:

## Effects

- Increase your Strength, Constitution, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Instead of exhaling destructive energy, you can expend a use of your Breath Weapon trait to roar, forcing each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). A target automatically succeeds on the save if it canâ€™t hear or see you. On a failed save, a target becomes [[Frightened]] of you for 1 minute. If the [[Frightened]] target takes any damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
