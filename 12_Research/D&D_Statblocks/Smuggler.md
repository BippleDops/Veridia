## Overview
"The Tide Walker"â€”one of the most successful smugglers in the history of cross-realm tradeâ€”vanished three months ago while carrying what witnesses describe as "the most dangerous cargo ever to cross the depths." His criminal organization is fragmenting, rival gangs are moving to claim his territory, and government agents from both realms are desperately searching for his final shipment. The party is hired to find the missing smuggler and his cargo before his absence triggers a war between the criminal underworld and legitimate authorities.

## Background
Marcus "Tide Walker" Deepcurrent built his reputation over twenty years by successfully moving anything from rare artifacts to political refugees between [[Aquabyssos]] and [[Aethermoor]]. His network included corrupt officials, desperate merchants, and underground railways that moved goods and people across the most dangerous routes in both realms. He was known for his absolute discretion, fair dealings, and most importantly, never asking questions about his cargo.

His final job was different. The client paid ten times his usual rate and provided magical containers that even Marcus wasn't allowed to examine. The cargo was loaded under the strictest security protocols, and Marcus himself took personal command of the transportâ€”something he hadn't done in five years. The convoy disappeared somewhere in the [[Border Territories]], and no trace has been found despite extensive searches by multiple organizations.

What the party will eventually discover is that Marcus was transporting a collection of ancient artifacts connected to [[The Lock]]â€”the magical barrier that keeps [[Aquabyssos]] and [[Aethermoor]] separate. His client was part of a radical faction seeking to either strengthen or destroy the barrier, but Marcus discovered the true nature of his cargo and made a choice that has put him in hiding while he decides what to do with world-changing power.

### The Converging Forces
**Multiple Parties Arrive Simultaneously:**

> [!danger] DM Secret
> Marcus discovered that his mysterious client is actually working for a faction that wants to merge the realms, but the client doesn't realize that his superiors plan to sacrifice [[Aquabyssos]] to power [[Aethermoor]]'s expansion. The Lock Fragments aren't just keys to the barrierâ€”they're the realm's life support system. Using them incorrectly won't just merge the worlds; it will drain one to feed the other, potentially destroying millions of lives in the process.
