# Aurora's Larder
## Overview
In my travels throughout Toril, I quickly learned that a full larder holds far more than [[Tea|tea]] and cakes. As well as stocking the kitchens of countless merchant-class folk, our larder list is perused and used to provision the highest courts in the land. My agents have traveled far and wide to set up lines of trade with places as distant as the jungles of Malatra and the mysterious stone-city of Tukan, as well as the more familiar sites of the Heartlands. After selecting [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Items|items]] from the following list, be sure to look over the meat, cheese, distilled goods, and [[Exotics|exotics]] that follow.
