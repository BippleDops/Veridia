## Overview
Captain Garrett Stormcutter is [[Aquabyssos World Overview's most successful "legitimate" merchant, operating from [New Tethys]] and [[The Wandering Atoll. He maintains the facade of a profit-driven trader while secretly funding and supplying the [Free Current]] rebellion.

His weathered face and grey-streaked beard mark him as one of the few who remember the surface world as an adult.
