# Long Rest
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 370. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A Long Rest is a period of extended downtime—at least 8 hours—available to any creature. During a Long Rest, you sleep for at least 6 hours and perform no more than 2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch.

During sleep, you have the [Unconscious](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Unconscious) condition. After you finish a Long Rest, you must wait at least 16 hours before starting another one.

## Benefits of the Rest

To start a Long Rest, you must have at least 1 [Hit Point](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). When you finish the rest, you gain the following benefits:

- **Regain All HP.** You regain all lost [Hit Points](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) and all spent [Hit Point Dice](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-point-dice-xphb.md). If your Hit Point maximum was reduced, it returns to normal.  
- **Ability Scores Restored.** If any of your ability scores were reduced, they return to normal.  
- **Exhaustion Reduced.** If you have the [Exhaustion](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Exhaustion) condition, its level decreases by 1.  
- **Special Feature.** Some features are recharged by a Long Rest. If you have such a feature, it recharges in the way specified in its description.  

## Interrupting the Rest

A Long Rest is stopped by the following interruptions:

- Rolling [Initiative](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md)  
- Casting a spell other than a cantrip  
- Taking any damage  
- 1 hour of walking or other physical exertion.  

If you rested at least 1 hour before the interruption you gain the benefits of a [Short Rest](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb.md).

You can resume a Long Rest immediately after an interruption. If you do so, the rest requires 1 additional hour per interruption to finish.
