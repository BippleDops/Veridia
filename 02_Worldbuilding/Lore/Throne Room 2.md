# Throne Room
*The Crystal Heart of a Corrupted Kingdom*

## Overview

The Throne Room of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor has been transformed from a magnificent seat of royal power into something both beautiful and terrifying—a crystalline cathedral where [02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Queen]]'s possessed consciousness communes with [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage while making decisions that affect both worlds. The chamber serves not only as the kingdom's political center but as a dimensional nexus where crystal consciousness converges and reality itself becomes malleable.

Once the pride of Aethermoor architecture, featuring traditional crystal formations and noble grandeur, the room has undergone radical transformation as the queen's possession deepened. Massive crystal growths have erupted from floor, walls, and ceiling, creating an organic cathedral of living mineral consciousness that responds to royal emotions and divine will.

## Physical Transformation

### Original Design
**The Traditional Throne Room (Pre-Possession)**
The chamber originally exemplified [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s mastery of crystal architecture:
- **Dimensions**: 200 feet long, 100 feet wide, 80 feet high
- **Materials**: White marble floors with crystal veining, crystal column supports
- **Windows**: Massive stained crystal panels depicting royal history
- **Throne**: Carved from single massive crystal formation, traditional seat of power
- **Acoustics**: Natural crystal resonance providing perfect sound distribution

### Current State
**The Crystalline Cathedral (Post-Possession)**
The possessed queen's influence has radically transformed the space:

**The Living Walls:**
Crystal formations have grown through the original marble, creating organic surfaces that pulse with inner light. These walls are not merely decorative—they contain embedded consciousness that observes all who enter and communicates with the crystal network throughout the palace.

**The Prismatic Canopy:**
The ceiling has been replaced by a dome of interwoven crystal branches that extend upward into infinity. Visitors report being unable to see the top, as if the ceiling opens into other dimensions. Light refracts through these formations, creating constantly shifting patterns that affect viewers' emotional states.

**The Memory Floor:**
The marble floors have been partially absorbed by crystal growth, creating a surface that preserves and replays memories of important events. Footsteps on certain areas trigger visual and auditory echoes of past throne room scenes.

**The Dimensional Throne:**
The original crystal throne has grown into a massive formation that exists partially in multiple dimensions. [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Queen appears to sit suspended in air, supported by crystal formations that phase in and out of visible reality. The throne responds to her emotional state, growing larger during anger or contracting during contemplation.

### The Crystal Courtiers
**Living Mineral Consciousness**
Around the throne room, smaller crystal formations have developed that seem to serve as advisors or observers. These "crystal courtiers" may be:
- Crystallized memories of former advisors
- Fragments of [02_Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]]'s consciousness given form
- Manifestations of the throne room's own developing awareness
- Communication relays for the broader crystal network
- Repositories of political and historical knowledge

**The Whispering Gallery**
Certain crystal formations create acoustic effects that allow private communication across the vast chamber. The [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Possessed Noble Coterie uses these formations to coordinate without verbal communication, while the sounds sometimes carry fragments of conversations from other times and places.

## The Throne's Power

### Dimensional Authority
