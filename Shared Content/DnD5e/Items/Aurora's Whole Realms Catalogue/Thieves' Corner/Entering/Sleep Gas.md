## Description
A sleeping guard is undeniably nicer than a garotted one. We have three levels of potency for our sleeping gas, for small, medium, and large-size creatures. All come in sturdy stoppered flasks that break easily on impact. In liquid form when stoppered, these vials contain enough punch to instantly lay low one creature of the indicated size. Small: 5 gp/ flask; Man-size: 10 gp/flask; Large: 20 gp/flask.

## Additional Details
Effective `dice: 1d4+1` turns; useless against H or G sizes
