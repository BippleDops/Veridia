The maps included in this folder is made available to you under a free license for personal or commercial use thanks to the awesome supporters of the  [**Dyson Logos Patreon Campaign**](https://www.patreon.com/dysonlogos). Hundreds of amazingly generous people have come together to fund the site and these maps, making them free for your use.

Because of the incredible generosity of the patrons, Dyson Logo makes these maps free for commercial use also. Each month while funding is over the $300 mark, each map that achieves the $300+ funding level will be released under a free commercial license. You can use, reuse, remix and/or modify the maps that are being published under the commercial license on a royalty-free basis as long as they include attribution (“Cartography by Dyson Logos” or “Maps by Dyson Logos”).
