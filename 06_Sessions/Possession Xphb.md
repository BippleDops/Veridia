--- # Possession

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 372. Available in the SRD and the [[Free Rules (2024)* Some effects cause a creature to be possessed by another creature or entity. A possessing effect defines how the possession operates. Possession can be prevented by the [[[Protection From]] Evil and [[Good Xphb]] spell and ended by the [[dispel-evil-and-good-xphb (spells) spell. ## 🔧 [Deep Evaluation]] Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### [[Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### [Enhancement Improvements]] - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-[[Facing Summary Possession xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## [Lore Details]] Legends speak of possession xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around possession xphb. ## DM [[Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## [Plot Hooks]] - A stranger needs help stealing before the new moon
