# Necromancy School of Magic
*The Art of Death, Undeath, and Life Force*

> *"In the crushing depths where preservation becomes an act of defiance against entropy itself, necromancy evolves beyond mere death magic. We become the guardians of continuity, ensuring that consciousness and identity persist even when flesh fails and time seeks to erase all traces of existence."*
> — [[Death Speaker Marina Depthkeeper]], High Preserver of the [[Halls of Eternal Memory]]

## Overview

Necromancy represents one of the most complex and morally ambiguous schools of magic across both [[Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos]], encompassing the manipulation of life force, death energy, and the boundary between existence and void. In the vast underwater realm where traditional burial is impossible and the pressure of cosmic forces constantly threatens consciousness, necromancy has evolved into sophisticated systems of preservation, memory maintenance, and identity protection that serve essential functions for civilized survival.

The school's principles center on the manipulation of vital energies - the forces that distinguish living beings from inert matter and conscious entities from void emptiness. Necromancy operates through the fundamental understanding that life and death are not absolute states but rather positions on a spectrum of existence that can be influenced, redirected, and preserved through magical intervention.

In [[Aquabyssos]], necromancy has developed unique characteristics due to the environment's preservation properties and the proximity to cosmic forces that exist outside normal life-death cycles. Practitioners have mastered techniques for maintaining consciousness beyond physical death, preserving memories in crystalline matrices, and protecting individual identity against the dissolving influence of void forces.

The school serves multiple crucial functions in underwater society: preserving the knowledge and consciousness of important individuals, protecting citizens from void-induced identity dissolution, maintaining communication with deceased advisors, and ensuring that cultural memory persists across generations despite the challenges of underwater existence.

Advanced necromantic practitioners can maintain perfect preservation of consciousness, establish permanent communication with deceased entities, manipulate the fundamental forces that define existence itself, and even briefly reverse death under specific circumstances.

## Magical Theory and Principles

Necromancy operates on the fundamental principle that consciousness and identity are forms of energy that can be manipulated, preserved, and transferred independently of physical form or temporal existence.

### Core Theoretical Framework

**Life Force Dynamics**: Necromancy works by manipulating vital energy - the fundamental force that animates living beings and maintains consciousness. This energy can be concentrated, diluted, redirected, or preserved depending on the practitioner's skill and the specific techniques employed.

**Death State Management**: The transition from life to death is not an absolute boundary but rather a process that can be influenced, delayed, reversed, or modified through magical intervention. Skilled practitioners can maintain consciousness during this transition or even establish alternative forms of existence.

**Identity Preservation**: Individual consciousness and personal identity exist as complex patterns within vital energy that can be detected, analyzed, and preserved. These patterns can be maintained even when the original physical form is destroyed or fundamentally altered.

**Void Interface Management**: The interaction between conscious existence and cosmic void requires sophisticated magical frameworks to prevent dissolution. Necromancy provides techniques for maintaining individual identity even when exposed to reality-dissolving forces.

### Underwater Adaptations

**Pressure Preservation**: [[Aquabyssos]] necromancy incorporates ocean pressure as a natural preservation mechanism, using the crushing environment to maintain physical forms and consciousness patterns that would otherwise decay. Deep-sea preservation techniques can maintain beings in perfect stasis for millennia.

**Crystal Memory Storage**: The extensive crystalline formations throughout the underwater realm provide natural matrices for storing consciousness patterns and memories. Advanced practitioners can transfer complete identities into crystal networks for permanent preservation.

**Current Connection**: Ocean currents can carry preserved consciousness patterns across vast distances, allowing for communication networks that transcend death. Deceased individuals can maintain contact with living communities through current-based necromantic systems.

**Void Resistance**: The proximity to cosmic forces has required the development of specialized necromantic techniques for protecting consciousness against reality dissolution. These techniques maintain individual existence even when exposed to void influences.

### Advanced Applications

**Consciousness Networks**: Master necromancers can establish permanent networks connecting multiple preserved consciousnesses, creating collective entities that combine the knowledge and perspectives of numerous individuals while maintaining their distinct identities.

**Temporal Preservation**: Advanced practitioners can preserve beings across time, maintaining them in stasis during dangerous periods or storing them for future revival when circumstances improve.

**Reality Anchoring**: The most sophisticated necromantic techniques can anchor consciousness to reality itself, making individuals immune to existence-threatening effects including void dissolution and timeline erasure.

**Eternal Advisor Void Wisdom**: Deceased council member whose consciousness has been perfectly preserved for over five centuries. His accumulated knowledge provides crucial guidance for modern governmental decisions.

## Forbidden and Lost Spells

### Universal Death Magic
Spells capable of causing death across vast areas or affecting entire populations simultaneously are strictly forbidden due to their potential for catastrophic abuse. These techniques were developed during wartime but proved too dangerous for any practical application.

**The Great Dying Incident**: A historical attempt to create a weapon capable of killing all life in a target region resulted in uncontrolled spread that nearly destroyed several major settlements. This event led to strict regulations on large-scale death magic.

**Species Termination Spells**: Techniques designed to target specific types of creatures for complete extermination. These spells were forbidden after early experiments showed they could affect beneficial species and disrupt entire ecosystems.

### Identity Absorption Magic
Spells that steal or consume the consciousness and identity of other beings, adding their knowledge and capabilities to the caster, have been banned due to their inherently destructive nature and the risk of creating megalomaniacal entities.

**Consciousness Predation**: Legendary technique that allowed practitioners to absorb the complete minds of others, gaining all their memories and abilities while destroying the original identity. This practice created beings of immense power but completely alien psychology.

**Identity Merger Magic**: Spells that forcibly combined multiple consciousness patterns into single entities. These techniques were lost after creating unstable beings that posed threats to reality itself.

### Void Death Communion
Direct communication with entities from void space that exist in states beyond death has been forbidden after practitioners were transformed into beings that no longer qualified as living or undead.

**Beyond Death Protocol**: Historical techniques for accessing knowledge from entities that existed outside normal life-death cycles. These practices provided incredible insights but inevitably transformed practitioners into something that could not coexist with normal reality.

**Ultimate Entropy Contact**: Spells that established communication with the fundamental forces of dissolution and ending. Knowledge of these techniques was deliberately destroyed due to their tendency to spread destructive influences.

### Lost Life Creation
Ancient knowledge of creating entirely new forms of consciousness and vital energy from void materials has been lost to time. These techniques were said to create beings that were fully alive but had no connection to normal biological existence.

**Genesis Magic**: Historical spells that could create completely new forms of life from non-living materials. The knowledge was lost during the early period of [[Aquabyssos]] after created beings proved incompatible with existing ecosystems.

**Consciousness Fabrication**: Techniques for generating entirely original individual identities without requiring existing consciousness as a foundation. These methods were lost along with the understanding of how they interfaced with natural vital energy systems.
