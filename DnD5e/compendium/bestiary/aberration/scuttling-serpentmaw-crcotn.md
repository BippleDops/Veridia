## Description

A scuttling serpentmaw looks like an unusually large crab with a sleek black shell. It lurks in crevasses and deep underwater canyons. Once spotted, it scuttles toward its prey and reveals its most formidable feature: an armored maw concealed on the back of its shell. This serpentine appendage can extend out from the shell to tear into prey.

Though they inhabit water, serpentmaws can't swim. They move along the sea floor in small mobs, working together to tear apart much larger creatures they come across.
