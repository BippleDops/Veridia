Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Quest The Depth War as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Quest The Depth War.
