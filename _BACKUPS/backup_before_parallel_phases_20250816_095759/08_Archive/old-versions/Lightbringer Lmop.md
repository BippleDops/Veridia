*Weapon ([[Mace Xphb), uncommon* - **Damage**: `dice: 1d6` bludgeoning
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs. This +1 mace was made for a cleric of Lathander, the god of dawn. The head of the mace is shaped like a sunburst and made of solid brass. Named Lightbringer, this weapon glows as bright as a [Torch Xphb]] when its wielder commands. While glowing, the mace deals an extra`d6`radiant damage to undead creatures. *Source: Lost Mine of Phandelver p. 48* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Lightbringer lmop is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
