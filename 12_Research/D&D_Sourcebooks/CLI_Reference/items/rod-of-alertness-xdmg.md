# Rod of Alertness
*Rod, very rare (requires attunement)*  


- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

This rod has the following properties.

## Alertness

While holding the rod, you have [[advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) checks and on [[initiative-xphb|Initiative]] rolls. Spells. While holding the rod, you can cast the following spells from it:

- [[detect-evil-and-good-xphb|Detect Evil and Good]]  
- [[detect-magic-xphb|Detect Magic]]  
- [[detect-poison-and-disease-xphb|Detect Poison and Disease]]  
- [[see-invisibility-xphb|See Invisibility]]  

## Protective Aura

As a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod's head sheds [[bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]] in a 60-foot radius and [[dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] for an additional 60 feet. While in that [[bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]], you and your allies gain a +1 bonus to [[armor-class-xphb|Armor Class]] and saving throws and can sense the location of any [[conditions#Invisible|Invisible]] creature that is also in the [[bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]].

The rod's head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes or when a creature takes a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to pull the rod from the ground. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
