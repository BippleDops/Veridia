# Trap #57 - "Never Touch A High Level Wizards "Stuff"!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> Before the party presses on the wizards in the group will go amuk,"issuing a stern warning. Here there be HIGH LEVEL MAGIC. It is in the rock of [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] that sank into the ground, and in the walls, floor and ceiling. All these areas for a depth of 10 feet are interpenetrated with a magic spell. The level of this spell and its nature are impossible to discern. (Although the gold lettering behind the throne might provide a clue, hint, hint.) The party ô€‚±ill also notice that the rock is clad with dwarvish steel on the side that faces into the chamber.
> 
> Easily in the party's sight with light reflected off the polished steel walls is a chamber. It is a 40 foot cube of shining steel, in the center of which is a pyramid of 3 steps, the total over 5 feet high. The base of the pyramid is 20 feet on a side and set in the exact center of the room.
> 
> At the apex of the monument is a cube of the blue hy-Atlantaen stone. Thrust into this stone is a gnarled old wooden seeming staff. Three guesses who this handy item once belonged to.
> 
> Eventually someone is going to want this handy little tool badly enough to try to pull it out of the stone. Any one of the tomb robbers who try will meet with a truly colorful fate. Anyone touching the staff, either with their hands, or by some mechanical means, will end up on the receiving end of a jolt that will give the outward appearance of being magical. (You don't think the delvers will try to rope it, or slice it off with a sword? What have I been trying to teach you, about the deviousness of all prospective trap fodder? When you least expect it -zamm- up they come with some new harebrained plan. Expect the unexpected.)
> 
> Beneath this room is a gigantic version of the shock generating wheel found at [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] and in one of the bronze doors. It is driven by yet another branch of the underground stream. The power generated is enough to act as a joy buzzer for the entire City of Khazan, all 50,000 at once. Channeled through one or two delvers, it creates a beautiful blue spark, as it arcs to ground. Of course what's left of the delvers after the experience could be conveniently stored in a shoe box.
> 
> A scenic note is that if the party tries to remove the staff, at the same time as a touch occurs, a hydraulic force will drive the stone blocks that sank into the ground when the golem was defeated back into place, effectively trapping the party in a steel box. A little experimentation on the part of the magic users will show that nothing will get out of this room. The armor on the walls is proof against digging. The magic in the walls prevents teleportation. In short, nothing leaves the room, not man, magic or immortal soul!
> 
> Now the arc to ground is perfectly natural, but at the same time from the bodies of any delvers foolisp to touch the staff a golden bolt of lightning will shoot into the wall opposite [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]], flash once and be gone. \[A note: Keep track of the physical Strength and Intelligence of those delvers affected. Once the combined total of the absorbed Strength and Intelligence from those zapped by the staff, and the right hand door's three hole trap reaches 416 then the next phase of the tomb's operation will commence operation.]
> 
> This is a three skull trap, too easy to just walk away from, but no delver will, and once they try the trap becomes a four skuller. With only one exit.
> 
> After enough of the party has tried in desperation to pull the staff out or somehow free it from the stone, and thereby created a fair number of little soot piles they will reach the level required to lead us to the final step on this journey.
