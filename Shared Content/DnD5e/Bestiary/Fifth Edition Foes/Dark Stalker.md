## Special Traits

**Death Throes:** When a dark stalker is slain, its body combusts in a flash of flame. All creatures within 20 feet of the slain stalker must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (`dice: 3d6`) fire damage, or half damage with a successful save. The stalker's combustible gear is burned to ash, but other items (shortswords, poison vials, coins, gems) survive the burst of fire.

**Poison:** Dark stalkers are skilled in the use of poison. They favor a foul-smelling, dark paste called black smear that they distill from fungi that grows only in deep caverns. Creatures poisoned by black smear take 2 (`dice: 1d4`) poison damage immediately and suffer the usual effect of the poisoned condition. In addition, they must repeat the DC 12 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of their turns. On a successful save, they are no longer poisoned; on a failed save, they take `dice: 1d4` poison damage and the poisoned condition continues. Each dark stalker carries six doses of this poison, and they train from childhood to reapply it to their shortswords as a bonus action after a successful hit.

**See in Darkness:** Light conditions are reversed in effect for dark stalkers. They treat complete darkness as bright light and bright light as complete darkness. A dark stalker sees perfectly in darkness of any kind, including magical darkness.

**Sneak Attack:** A dark stalker's shortsword attack does an extra 7 (`dice: 2d6`) piercing damage if the dark stalker has advantage on the attack or if another dark stalker or [[Dark Creeper|dark creeper]] is within 5 feet of the target.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** Dark stalkers can use the following spelllike abilities, using Charisma as their casting ability (DC 11). Dark stalkers don’t need material components to use these abilities.

- At will: *darkness, detect magic, fog cloud*

## Actions

**Multiattack:** A dark stalker attacks twice with shortswords.

**Shortsword:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d6+4`) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned (see below).

## Ecology

**Environment**: Any underground

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, gang (3–6), or clan (20–80 plus 1 dark stalker per 20 [[Dark Creeper|dark creepers]])

## Description

[[Dark Creeper|Dark creepers]] lurk in lightless places deep below the surface of the world, venturing forth at night or into neighboring societies when the urge to steal and cause mayhem grows too great to resist. Endless layers of filthy, moldering black cloth shroud these small creatures, leading some to believe that the creature inside is smaller still. Dark creepers flee from bright light but are quite brave in the dark. They stand just under 4 feet tall and weigh about 80 pounds. Their flesh is pale and moist, and their large eyes are milky white. Dark creepers exude a foul stench of sweat and spoiled food, owing primarily to the fact that they never take off their clothing—instead piling on new layers when the outermost one grows too ragged.

It is known that subterranean cities of dark creepers exist. Most creatures that have seen these cities venture no closer than necessary, for the route to the city will be lined with traps, snares, and other deadly devices to bedevil trespassers. Each city is a large circular pit with a spiraling staircase leading down through the multi-layered city. A [[Dark Creeper|dark creeper]] city is constantly shrouded in impenetrable darkness. The actual habitat and details of dark creeper society remain a mystery, as few who venture into a dark creeper city return to testify about what they’ve seen (if, indeed, they saw anything in the stygian darkness). The strange and mysterious dark stalkers are the undisputed leaders of dark creeper society. Deep underground, these creatures dwell in remote villages (some rumors suggest entire cities) built of stone and fungus in caverns where they are served and worshiped by the coarser, smaller dark creepers. Dark stalkers come to the surface rarely. When they do, they are on a mission, and accompanied by a small army of dark creepers.

Dark stalkers are tall, frail humanoids with incredibly pale skin. They wear multiple layers of dark cloth and blackened hide armor, but unlike their lesser kin, a dark stalker’s garb is always clean and spotless. Each dark stalker carries a pair of short swords—they prefer these weapons to all others. Dark stalkers are 6 feet tall and weigh 100 pounds. In a fight, dark stalkers are not above sacrificing lesser creatures, including dark creepers, to win the day or to cover their retreat if things go poorly. They never fight to the death if they can escape by sacrificing others. Dark stalkers hate light and prefer to fight under the cover of darkness.

For all the mayhem and trouble a pack of dark creepers can cause, this is nothing compared to the danger a tribe led by the sinister dark stalkers represents. Dark creepers treat their tall, lithe masters almost like gods, presenting them with offerings and obeying their every whim. All of the heavy work and labor falls on the shoulders of the creepers, freeing the dark stalkers for their own decadent pleasures. Yet the dark creepers themselves see no inherent imbalance in this arrangement—to a dark creeper, a life in servitude to a dark stalker is a life fulfilled.

The origins of the dark stalkers and dark creepers are shrouded in mystery, made even deeper by the fact that these folk do not keep records of their history. Many scholars believe that, just as the drow descended from elves, so too must the dark folk have descended from humanity; their eerie powers and spell-like abilities grew over generation upon generation of devotion to profane and sinister magic. Alas, the truth of the race’s history may never be known.
