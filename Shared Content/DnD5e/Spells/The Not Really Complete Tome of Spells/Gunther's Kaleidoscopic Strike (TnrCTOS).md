# Gunther's Kaleidoscopic Strike (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *8th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
A beam of scintillating, kaleidoscopic light shoots from your finger toward a spellcasting target within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target must make a saving throw using its spellcasting attribute.

On a failure, the target’s mind is “short-circuited” and it loses a number of spells equal to your level, starting with 1st-level spells and moving on to more powerful spells. That target will not be able to cast those spells until it has had a chance to re-prepare them.

Targets that have innate spellcasting abilities lose the ability to cast that number of spells until it takes a short or long rest.

This spell has no effect on non-spellcasters.
