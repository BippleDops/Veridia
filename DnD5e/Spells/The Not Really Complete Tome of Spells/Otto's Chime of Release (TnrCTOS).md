# Otto's Chime of Release (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *1st-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (30-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (a small brass chime)

**Duration**: 1 round


## Effects
You gently ring the chime and magical vibrations issue forth. These vibrations instantly release any form on nonmagical bindings on a single individual you can see within range: ropes are untied, chains and shackles are loosened, stocks are opened, gags are removed, bridles and saddles are unbuckled, and so on.
