# Yolande's Regal Presence
*5th-level, Enchantment*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/yolandes-regal-presence.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature tiara)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You surround yourself with unearthly majesty in a 10-foot [[Area of Effect Xphb]]. Whenever the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] enters the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] or ends its turn there, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes `4d6` Psychic damage and has the [[conditions#prone|Prone]] condition, and you can push it up to 10 feet away. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage only. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]
