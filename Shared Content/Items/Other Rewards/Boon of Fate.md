# Boon of Fate
**Type**: Supernatural Gifts

## Overview: 
When another creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an ability check, an attack roll, or a saving throw, you can roll a ```dice: d10``` and apply the result as a bonus or penalty to the roll. Once you use this boon, you can't use it again until you finish a short rest.
