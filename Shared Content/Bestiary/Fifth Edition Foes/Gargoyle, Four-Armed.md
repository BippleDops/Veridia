*Several varieties of gargoyles exist, and each is detailed below. For all their differences, gargoyles also share some common traits. They can remain utterly motionless for days, weeks, or even years, and they are indistinguishable from stone for as long as they remain still. Regardless of how long they’ve been inert, they can spring into sudden, savage action in an instant.*

*This creature appears to be a hideous and winged humanoid carved of stone. Its ears are oversized and pointed, and two large, backward-curving horns jut from its head above its eyes. It has four arms, and each ends in stony claws.*

## Special Traits
**Stony Appearance:** While a four-armed gargoyle sits motionless, it is indistinguishable from natural stone and can't be detected as alive by any means.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A four-armed gargoyle attacks twice with claws, bites once, and gores once with its horns.

**Claws:*** Melee Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (`dice: 2d8+2`) slashing damage.

**Bite:*** Melee Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d8+2`) piercing damage.

**Gore:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d8+2`) piercing damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any land, aquatic, and underground

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, or wing (5–16)

## Description
Like their two-armed brethren, four-armed gargoyles often perch indefinitely without moving. Exactly why they do this is unknown: it may be no more than an ambush technique, or it might fulfill some unknown physiological need for the gargoyle. There seems to be no limit to how long a gargoyle can remain motionless, without food, water, or air.

Gargoyles are shockingly sadistic. When a four-armed gargoyle has the upper hand in battle, it often draws out the conflict as long as it can in its effort to inflict as much pain and fear as it can on foes.
