--- # Wand of Winter

*Wand, rare (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/wand-of-winter.webp#right) - **Weight**: 1.0 lbs. This wand looks and feels like an icicle. You must be attuned to the wand to use it. The wand has 7 charges, which are used to fuel the spells within it. With the wand in hand, you can use your action to cast one of the following spells from the wand, even if you are incapable of casting spells: [[ray-of-frost-xphb (spells)]] (no charges, or 1 charge to cast at 5th level; +5 to hit with ranged spell attack), [[sleet-storm-xphb (spells)]] (3 charges; spell save DC 15), or [[ice-storm-xphb (spells)]] (4 charges; spell save DC 15). No components are required. The wand regains`1d6 + 1`expended charges each day at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a`d20`. On a 20, the wand melts away, forever destroyed. *Source: Hoard of the Dragon Queen p. 94* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Wand of winter hotdq is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
