# Ring of Regeneration
*Ring, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/ring-of-regeneration.webp#right)


While wearing this ring, you regain `d6` [Hit Points](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) every 10 minutes if you have at least 1 [Hit Point](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). If you lose a body part, the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full functionality after `1d6 + 1` days if you have at least 1 [Hit Point](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) the whole time.
