## Description
Hoar foxes live and hunt in stable packs of up to eight animals. Although they are shy and generally not aggressive toward humanoids, they are also curious creatures, and their curiosity (and taste for easy food like chickens and young sheep) too often lead them to build their underground dens near humanoid settlements. They are hunted for their remarkably warm fur, which brings a handsome sum on the market.

When threatened, hoar foxes tend to bite a foe in an attempt to scare it away. Only if that fails (or they have prior experience with it failing against similar attackers) do they use their breath weapon.

While attacking a hoar fox with fire seems like an effective tactic, given their vulnerability to it, any fire damage destroys the fox’s pelt and renders it worthless for sale.
