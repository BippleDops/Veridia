## Special Traits

**Brachiation:** A decapus can move through trees at its climb speed (30 feet per round) by using its tentacles to swing from tree to tree, provided the trees are no more than 10 feet apart.

**Sound Imitation:** A decapus can mimic the sounds of any creature it has previously encountered with uncanny accuracy, though it can't mimic humanoid speech patterns for more than two or three words at a stretch. The ruse can be detected with a contest between the decapus's Deception and a listener's Insight.

**Spell-like Abilities:** A decapus can use the following spell-like ability, using Charisma as its casting ability (DC 11). The decapus doesn’t need material components to use this ability.

- At Will: *major image*

**Constriction:** *Melee Attack:* automatic hit, one creature already grappled by a tentacle at the start of the decapus's turn. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d6+2`) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled and restrained.

## Ecology

**Environment**: Ruins, underground, and temperate or warm forests

**Organization**: Solitary (or a mated pair, rarely)

## Description

Decapi are solitary creatures that dwell in ruins, caverns, or dense forest (where their climbing ability gives them great mobility through the tree canopy for pursuing prey or evading predators). On the ground, decapi are slow-moving, so they spend most of their time among the tree tops or hanging from ceilings.

As nocturnal hunters, decapi are quite fond of human, elf, and halfling flesh. When food is scarce, they can exist on a diet of rats, snakes, and other small creatures or dungeon denizens. Decapi prefer a solitary life; the only time more than one will ever be encountered together is during their infrequent mating season. Young decapi are born live, and the female gives birth to only a single young decapus during each mating season. If food is extremely scarce, some decapus females have been known to eat their young.

This creature’s body is a 4-foot-diameter globe of pallid green. Some have been reported with purple or yellow coloring, but they are rare. Dark brown or black hair grows in seemingly random patches. Regardless of its body color, each decapus has 10 tentacles similar to an octopus’s protruding from its spherical body. Each tentacle is covered in suction cups that aid the creature in climbing and moving trees, but also in catching and killing its prey. Its large wide maw sports sickly yellow teeth and foul breath. Decapi seem to be able to speak with others of their kind using guttural noises.

A decapus hunts with its *major image*. When it senses potential prey nearby, it creates an illusion intended to draw unwary creatures within reach of its tentacles. Usually this involves a creature that will elicit sympathy from the prey being threatened somehow. For example, when typical humanoid adventurers approach, the decapus is likely to create the image of a child surrounded by hungry wolves or of a young woman or man being terrorized by bandits.
