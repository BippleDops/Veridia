# Iron Spike
*Adventuring gear*  


- **Cost**: 1 sp
- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

Iron Spikes come in bundles of ten. As a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action, you can use a blunt object, such as a [[light-hammer-xphb|Light Hammer]], to hammer a spike into wood, earth, or a similar material. You can do so to jam a door shut or to then tie a [[rope-xphb|Rope]] or [[chain-xphb|Chain]] to the Spike.
