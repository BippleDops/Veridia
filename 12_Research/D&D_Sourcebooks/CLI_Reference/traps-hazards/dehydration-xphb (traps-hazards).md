--- # Dehydration

*Generic Hazard* A creature requires an amount of water per day based on its size, as shown in the Water Needs per Day table. A creature that drinks less than half the required water for a day gains 1 [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] level at the day's end. [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] caused by dehydration can't be removed until the creature drinks the full amount of water required for a day. **Water Needs per Day** | Size | Water |
|------|-------|
| Tiny | 1/4 gallon |
| Small | 1 gallon |
| Medium | 1 gallon |
| Large | 4 gallons |
| Huge | 16 gallons |
| Gargantuan | 64 gallons |

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of dehydration xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around dehydration xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Related Notes - [[Similar Topic 1]]
