![[04_Resources/Assets/Art/Lore/Professor_Euclid_Mindmaze.png|Professor Euclid Mindmaze Portrait]]

## Summary
Professor Euclid Mindmaze describes a turning current in history where choices about memory, depth, and sovereignty reshaped travel, trade, and ritual.

## Historical Context

- Spread: Merchant routes adopted secret signs to bypass tariffs; songs encoded depth-keys.
- Present: Competing narratives justify new taxes, oaths, and contraband routes.

## What It Means at the Table
- Investigation: On a lead toward old tariffs, players can extract schedules that reduce travel risks for a session.
- Social: Reciting the chapel oath grants advantage on one Persuasion check if honored afterward.

- A rite echoes the activation cadence needed for [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]].
- Testimony suggests [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]] financed a pivotal bribe.
