--- # Downtime Activity: Recuperating

*Source: Player's Handbook p. 187* You can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison. After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a **DC 15** Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results: - End one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points. - For the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Downtime activity recuperating phb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
