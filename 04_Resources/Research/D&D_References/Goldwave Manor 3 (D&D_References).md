> â€” [[Aurelius Goldwave, Master of the House ## Overview Goldwave Manor stands as the most magnificent private residence in [Port Meridian]], serving simultaneously as luxurious family estate, sophisticated ficial headquarters, and exclusive social center for [[Aethermoor's mercantile elite. Built by the legendary [Goldwave Trading Empire]] over three generations, this architectural marvel demonstrates how vast wealth can be transformed into lasting power and influence. Unlike traditional noble houses that derive their status from bloodlines and land holdings, the Goldwave family has created their aristocracy through commercial genius and ficial innovation. Their manor reflects this unique position, combining the grandeur expected of high nobility with cutting-edge magical technology and practical business facilities that manage a trading empire spanning multiple realms. The estate occupies a prime location overlooking both [[Port Meridian Harbor and the city's central ficial district, strategically positioned to monitor commercial activity while displaying the family's prosperity. The manor's distinctive architecture, featuring walls that literally flow with liquid gold suspended in crystal matrices, has become an iconic symbol of merchant power and sophisticated wealth. Beyond its role as private residence, Goldwave Manor functions as an exclusive ficial institution, diplomatic center, and social hub where the most important commercial and political decisions affecting [Aethermoor]]'s economy are negotiated over elegant dinners and in opulent private chambers. ### The Flowing Gold Aesthetic **Liquid Gold Walls:**

The manor's most distinctive feature consists of walls constructed from specially treated crystal that contains flowing streams of actual liquid gold. This magical architecture serves both aesthetic and practical purposesâ€”the gold flows adjust to lighting conditions and ambient temperature while providing inherent magical protection against intrusion. **Crystal Foundation Systems:**

Built upon a foundation of rare crystal formations naturally occurring beneath the site, the manor draws power from these geological features to maintain its magical systems. The crystals also provide perfect acoustic properties for private conversations and business meetings. **Adaptive Architecture:**

Magical systems allow rooms to reconfigure themselves based on their intended use. Business meeting spaces can expand or contract to accommodate different group sizes, while entertainment areas transform to match the type of social function being hosted. ### The Five Primary Wings **The Residential Wing**
