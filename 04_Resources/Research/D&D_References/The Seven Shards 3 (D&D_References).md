> [!warning] DM Only

> When all seven gather in one place:
> 1. Reality tears open
> 2. Divine realm merges with material
> 3. Bearer must choose: Destroy, Reform, or Become
> 4. Choice determines world's fate ### Destroying a Shard

> [!warning] DM Only - Possible Methods

> - Unite all seven, then choose destruction
> - Divine intervention (true god)
> - Sacrifice of equal divine essence
> - Return to origin point during eclipse
> - Unknown cost to reality itself ### The Restoration Prophecy

*"Seven lights that fell from grace,*
*Seven powers time won't erase,*
*When united in one hand,*
*Gods shall walk upon the land."* ### The Warning

*"Beware the crown reformed in haste,*
*For power gained is humanity waste,*
*The price of godhood, mortals learn,*
*Is everything for which they yearn."* ## The Prophecy of Reunification > **For the Table - Using the Prophecy:**

> - **Partial Reveals:** Give players one line per major milestone

> - **Multiple Interpretations:** Each faction reads it differently - let players discover why
> - **False Prophecies:** Include 2-3 red herrings that seem equally valid
> - **Player Agency:** The prophecy describes what COULD happen, not what MUST happen ### The Ultimate Choice

If party gathers all seven:
1. **Destroy**: Save world, lose magic
2. **Reform**: New god rises
3. **Scatter**: Restart cycle
4. **Transform**: Change reality's nature ## DM Secrets

> [!warning] Ultimate Truth
> The Shards aren't just fragmentsâ€”they're Aetheron's attempt to experience mortality through division. Each represents an aspect of divinity experiencing mortal existence. The Golden Shard in Aria is his heart, experiencing innocence and growth. Reunification means choosing between godhood's power and mortality's meaning. ## Player-Facing Summary The Seven Shards is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Seven Shards as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around The Seven Shards. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Plot Hooks - Someone is blackmailing a artifact for revenge

- A journal reveals the truth about a local noble
- A prisoner has gone missing and chaos spreads ## Related Notes - [[Similar Topic 1
