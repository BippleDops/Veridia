--- # Talisman of Ultimate Evil

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/talisman-of-ultimate-evil.webp#right) - **Weight**: 1.0 lbs. This item symbolizes unrepentant evil. A creature that isn't a Fiend or an Undead that touches the talisman takes`8d6`Necrotic damage and takes the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Holy Symbol You can use the talisman as a Holy Symbol. You gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it. ## Ultimate End The talisman has 6 charges. While wearing or holding the talisman, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of yourself. A flaming fissure opens under the target, and the target makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. If the target is a Celestial, it has [[Advantage Xphb]] on the save. On a failed save, the target falls into the fissure and is destroyed, leaving no remains. On a successful save, the target isn't cast into the fissure but takes`4d6`Psychic damage from the ordeal. In either case, the fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman dissolves into foul-smelling slime and is destroyed. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 315.
