*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 132. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* Ghouls rise from the bodies of cannibals and villains with depraved hungers. They form packs out of shared voracity. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Ghouls *Eaters of the Dead* - **Habitat.** Swamp, Underdark, Urban - **Treasure.** Any Packs of ghouls haunt the rotten corners of the world, ravenously hunting for corpses and those soon to be corpses. These gaunt, animate cadavers with unnaturally long tongues dwell in catacombs and ruins where they devour the contents of graves and paralyze foes with vicious claws. > [!quote] > > On a plain of teeth, in a temple of filth, the starving king wastes no morsel. Every coffin a banquet. Every slab a platter. Now is the time of feasting!```statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of ghoul xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around ghoul xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Secret Pact - Summon ancient evil ## Plot Hooks - Someone is protecting an heir for love
