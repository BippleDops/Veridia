## Description
These deeply resonant, 6-stringed cousins of the [[Violin|violin]] work well alone, or can flesh out a larger ensemble of instruments. With melancholy music they are matchless. Favored by dwarven players for their dark tones and mournful voices, our viols come from the same craftsmen who create our violins. (70 gp)
