## Special Traits
**Slippery:** Bloody bones are difficult to grapple or snare because of the constant flow of blood and mucus across their bodies. Webs, magic or otherwise, do not affect bloody bones. A bloody bones has tactical advantage to escape from a grapple, and enemies trying to escape from its grapple have tactical disadvantage.

**Drag with Tendril:** As a bonus action, a bloody bones can drag each creature grappled by its tendrils 10 feet directly toward the bloody bones. When a creature grappled by the bloody bones's tendrils is within 5 feet of the bloody bones, it can be clawed automatically (no attack roll is necessary). The bloody bones's tendrils can be attacked separately (AC 13); 6 points of slashing damage severs the tendril. This damage affects only the tendril, however, and doesn't reduce the bloody bones's hit points. The monster generates a new tendril to replace the severed one at the start of its next turn.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A bloody bones attacks twice with claws or four times with tendrils.

**Claw:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d8+3`) slashing damage. This attack hits automatically if the target is grappled by the bloody bones.

**Tendril:** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +5 to hit, reach 30 ft., one creature. Hit: 3 (`dice: 1d4`) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled and can be dragged (see above).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any caves and ruins

**Organization**: Solitary or gang (2â€“5)

## Description
Bloody bones are evil undead spirits that haunt caverns, caves, and other desolate places. Their origins are unknown, but they are believed to be the undead remnants of adventurers who desecrated evil temples and were punished by corrupt gods for their actions.

From a distance, they are likely to be mistaken for skeletons. Those who make this mistake often regret it, for the bloody bones is far worse than the undead creature it resembles. A bloody bones stands about 6 feet tall. It is unknown if they can speak, but they never do.

A bloody bones prefers to hide in the shadows and wait for its prey to pass nearby. It then leaps to the attack, entwining its opponents with its tendrils and clawing its prey to death.
