# Boots of Elvenkind
*Wondrous Item, major, uncommon*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks that rely on moving silently.
