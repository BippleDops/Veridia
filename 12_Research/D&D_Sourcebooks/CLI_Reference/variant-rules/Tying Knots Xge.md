# Tying Knots
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 78* 

The rules are purposely open-ended concerning mundane tasks like tying knots, but sometimes knowing how well a knot was fashioned is important in a dramatic scene when someone is trying to untie a knot or slip out of one. Here's an optional rule for determining the effectiveness of a knot.

The creature who ties the knot makes an Intelligence ([[skills#Sleight%20of%20Hand|Sleight of Hand]]) check when doing so. The total of the check becomes the DC for an attempt to untie the knot with an Intelligence ([[skills#Sleight%20of%20Hand|Sleight of Hand]]) check or to slip out of it with a Dexterity ([[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]) check.

This rule intentionally links [[skills#Sleight%20of%20Hand|Sleight of Hand]] with Intelligence, rather than Dexterity. This is an example of how to apply the rule in the [[skills with different abilities phb|"Variant: Skills with Different Abilities"]] section in chapter 7 of the player's handbook.
