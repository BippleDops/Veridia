While the blade exists, this magic weapon functions as a Longsword with [item properties#Finesse|Finesse]]. If you are proficient with Longswords or Shortswords, you are proficient with the Sun Blade. You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals Radiant damage instead of Slashing damage. When you hit an Undead with it, that target takes an extra`d8`Radiant damage. ## Sunlight The sword's luminous blade emits [[Light Xphb in a 15-foot radius and [Light Xphb]] for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic action to expand or reduce its radius of [Light Xphb]] and [[Light Xphb by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 312. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* ## Player-Facing Summary Sun blade xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.

Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
