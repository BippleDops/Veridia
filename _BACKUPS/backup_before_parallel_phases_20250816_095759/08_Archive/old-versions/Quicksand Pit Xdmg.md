--- # Quicksand Pit

*Generic Hazard* A quicksand pit is 10 feet deep and covers the ground in a 10-foot square. A creature that enters the area sinks``dice: 1d4` + 1`feet into the quicksand and has the [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained condition. At the start of each of the creature's turns, it sinks another`d4`feet. As long as the creature isn't completely submerged in quicksand, it can take an action to try to escape, doing so with a successful Strength ([skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check (**DC 10** plus the number of feet the creature has sunk into the quicksand). A creature that is completely submerged in quicksand has [[Cover Xphb and the [conditions#Blinded|Blinded]] condition and risks suffocation. A creature can pull another creature within its reach out of a quicksand pit by taking an action and succeeding on a Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check (**DC 5** plus the number of feet the creature has sunk into the quicksand). ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## At Higher Levels You can scale this hazard for higher levels by making the pit deeper and increasing the number of feet a creature sinks at the start of each of its turns, as shown in the following table. | Levels | Pit Depth | Sinking Rate |
