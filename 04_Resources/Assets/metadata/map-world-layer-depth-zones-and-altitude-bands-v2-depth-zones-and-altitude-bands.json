  "prompt": "# TTRPG Asset Generation Prompt\n\n## Core Structure\n[Asset Type: map]\n[Game System: D&D 5e]\n[Intended Use: VTT and Print reference]\n\n## Detailed Description\nSubject: Depth Zones and Altitude Bands\nEnvironment: encounter space with clear tactical layout\nStyle: heroic tabletop fantasy (D&D 5e adjacent), unified painterly collection style, grounded medieval-fantasy materials, culturally coherent gear, no modern tech or signage, hand-painted top-down with clear grid, merged-zone aesthetic, reality fractures, hybrid aquatic-sky motifs\nTechnical Requirements: grid 15x15 squares at 140 DPI (70 px per 5 ft minimum, 140 px preferred), aspect 1:1, resolution 1024x1024\nPalette: teal/indigo blends, storm gold accents\n\n## Functional Elements (for maps)\n- Tactical Features: multiple paths and choke points, elevation changes, overlay symbology + legend, cover options\n- Scale: 15x15 squares, each square = 5 feet\n- Clarity: bold lines for walls/obstacles; fine lines for textures; consistent terrain patterns\n\n## Visual Specifications\n- Lighting: studio\n- Detail Level: high detail for zoom, simplified for overview\n- Composition: rule of thirds with clear focal points and visual flow\n\n## Practical Considerations\n- Must be readable at intended viewing size\n- No embedded text labels; use icons and clear linework only. Reserve clean margins and text-safe areas for VTT overlays. Render grid and numeric ticks crisply; avoid stylized fonts entirely. Zero rasterized words.\n- Avoid embedded text unless specified; prefer iconography and numbered pins\n\n## Negatives\n- nonsense text, watermarks, captions, signatures, artist names; modern signage, photoreal CGI, anime style, bloom glare; overly sexualized or glamorized portrayal\n\nThink deeply about creating an asset that enhances gameplay immersion while maintaining practical usability for TTRPG sessions.",
