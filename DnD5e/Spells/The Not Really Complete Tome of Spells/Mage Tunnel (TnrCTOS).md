# Mage Tunnel (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *9th-level*

**School**: *conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Up to 1,000 miles

**Components**: V, S, M (a 1-inch length of copper tubing engraved with silver runes)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minute. You open up a wormhole between your current location and an area well known to you that is no more than 1,000 miles away that is out-of-doors. If you or anyone else comes within 5 feet of either opening, that creature may make a Dexterity saving throw or get sucked through and instantly expelled at the other end.


## Effects
The *mage tunnel* can stay open for as long as 10 minutes, but you can dismiss it as a bonus action.
