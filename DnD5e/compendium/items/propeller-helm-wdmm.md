# Propeller Helm
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement by a small humanoid)*  

- **Properties**: [Requires Attunement](/rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement)
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

While worn, the helm allows its wearer to use an action to cast the [levitate](/compendium/spells/levitate.md) spell, requiring no components. The helm's propeller spins and whirs loudly until the spell ends. Each time the spell ends, there is a 50|50 percent% chance chance that the helm loses its magic and becomes nonmagical.
