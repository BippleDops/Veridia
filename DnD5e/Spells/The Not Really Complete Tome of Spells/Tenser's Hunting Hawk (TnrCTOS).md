# Tenser's Hunting Hawk (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a hawkâ€™s wing feath-er)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
You touch an arrow, which is then fired from a bow. As soon as it leaves the bow, the arrow turns into a hawk (*Monster Manual*, p.330). The hawk will then attack. You may use a bonus action to direct its attack. When the duration expires, or the hawk is slain, it reverts back to an arrow and falls.

If you cast this spell on a magical arrow (except for an *arrow of slaying)*, the hawk retains the magical properties. For instance, if cast on an *arrow +1*, the hawk gains +1 to attack and damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a 3rd- or 4th-level spell slot, the arrow transforms into an eagle. When you cast this spell with a 5th-level or higher spell slot, the arrow transforms into a giant eagle.
