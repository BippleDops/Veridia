# Archivist Mnemonic the Forgotten
*Keeper of What Was Lost, Guardian of Unremembered Truth*

## Overview
Archivist Mnemonic exists in a paradoxical state—he remembers everything that others have forgotten, but cannot remember his own past or identity. Chosen by the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]] to preserve memories that would otherwise be lost forever, he maintains the [[The Archive of Unremembered Things]] where discarded, stolen, or destroyed memories find sanctuary. His existence sustains the balance between remembering and forgetting that keeps the Deep Mother's dreams stable.

- **Presence**: Others often forget his name or face minutes after meeting him

### The Sacred Archive

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Mnemonic fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Memory Archive Access.** Mnemonic can access any memory stored in [[The Archive of Unremembered Things]] as an action. He gains perfect knowledge of events, skills, or information contained in accessed memories.

**The Forgetting Touch.** As a bonus action, Mnemonic can touch a willing creature and remove painful or unwanted memories, storing them in the Archive. The creature gains relief from trauma but loses associated knowledge.

**Perfect Recall.** Mnemonic can remember every detail of every memory he has ever encountered, except his own personal past. He has advantage on all Intelligence-based checks and cannot be affected by memory-altering magic.

**Paradox of Identity.** Mnemonic exists in a state of personal amnesia while maintaining perfect memory of others' experiences. He cannot be targeted by divination spells that would reveal his past, but he can be affected by divination regarding his current thoughts and intentions.

**Spellcasting.** Mnemonic is a 16th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks). He knows the following spells:

- **Cantrips (at will):** mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation, guidance, thaumaturgy
- **1st level (4 slots):** detect magic, identify, comprehend languages, sanctuary
- **2nd level (3 slots):** detect thoughts, suggestion, locate object
- **3rd level (3 slots):** counterspell, dispel magic, sending, tongues

- **6th level (1 slot):** mass suggestion, programmed illusion
- **7th level (1 slot):** plane shift (to memory realms), teleport
- **8th level (1 slot):** feeblemind, mind blank

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Mnemonic makes two Memory Projection attacks or casts two spells.

**Memory Projection.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +14 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 18 (4d6 + 4) psychic damage. Mnemonic can choose to project a traumatic memory, causing the target to be stunned until the end of their next turn, or a pleasant memory, causing the target to be charmed by Mnemonic for 1 minute.

**Archive Manifestation (Recharge 5-6).** Mnemonic summons a semi-physical manifestation of a powerful archived memory within 60 feet. The manifestation acts as a ally for 1 minute, using the statistics of a creature appropriate to the memory (CR 5 or lower, DM's choice). The manifestation has all the knowledge and skills of the original memory's owner.

**Mass Forgetting (1/Day).** All creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they forget the last 24 hours of their lives. Mnemonic stores these memories in the Archive, and they can be restored later if he chooses.

**Memory Restoration (3/Day).** Mnemonic touches a creature and can restore any memory that has been lost, stolen, or suppressed. This includes memories removed by magic, trauma, or his own abilities.

**The Weight of Remembrance (1/Day).** Mnemonic overwhelms a creature within 60 feet with the emotional weight of all the painful memories stored in the Archive. The target must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they take 45 (10d8) psychic damage and are incapacitated by overwhelming empathy for 1 minute. On a success, they take half damage and are not incapacitated.

### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)
Mnemonic can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.

**Move.** Mnemonic moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Archive Search.** Mnemonic accesses the Archive to gain specific knowledge or insight, effectively casting a divination spell of 3rd level or lower.

**Memory Touch.** Mnemonic uses his Forgetting Touch ability or Memory Restoration on a willing creature within reach.

**Memory Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** Mnemonic makes a Memory Projection attack.

### Lair Actions
When encountered in [[The Archive of Unremembered Things]], Mnemonic can take lair actions on initiative count 20:

**Archive Awakening.** Stored memories throughout the Archive become semi-active, providing information and minor assistance to Mnemonic and his allies.

**Forgetting Field.** All creatures in the Archive except Mnemonic must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or forget why they came to the Archive for 1 minute.

**Memory Maze.** The Archive's layout shifts based on the emotional resonance of stored memories, creating difficult terrain and potentially separating intruders.

## Enhanced Background & The Great Forgetting

### The Lost Identity
**Pre-Forgetting Life**: Evidence suggests Mnemonic was once a prominent scholar, possibly a court wizard or university researcher
**The Catastrophic Event**: A massive memory-related magical disaster that affected an entire city district
**Survivors' Accounts**: Others who experienced the Great Forgetting describe reality "folding in on itself" as memories became physical
**Personal Sacrifice**: Theories suggest Mnemonic may have deliberately sacrificed his identity to contain the disaster
**The Aftermath**: Found in the Archive with no memory of arrival, but with comprehensive knowledge of memory magic

### The Archive's Origins
**Dimensional Nexus**: The Archive exists partially in memory-space, making it larger inside than outside
**Self-Sustaining**: Fed by the collective unconscious desire to preserve important experiences
**Growing Collection**: Constantly expanding as more memories are lost, abandoned, or suppressed worldwide
**Emotional Resonance**: Organized by feeling and significance rather than chronology or topic
**Divine Protection**: [[The Deep Mother]]'s influence protects the Archive from outside interference

### The Paradox Condition
**Selective Amnesia**: Can access any memory except those that belong to his personal history
**Identity Fragmentation**: Exists as a function rather than a person, defined by service rather than self
**Temporal Displacement**: Uncertain how long he has served in the Archive—could be decades or centuries
**Memory Echoes**: Occasionally experiences fragments of his past as if they belonged to someone else
**The Ultimate Question**: Whether recovering his identity would destroy his ability to serve the Archive
