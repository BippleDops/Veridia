# Crown of Angels (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *8th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (an opal worth at least 200 gp and a circlet or crown made of a ma-terial appropriate to your deity; the opal is shattered during the casting but the circlet is not)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You place a circlet on your head or the head of an ally and the circlet begins to glow. The circlet takes one of three forms:

♦ ***Crown of Brilliance.*** Your circlet glows with blazing golden light. If in battle, your opponents in melee combat must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute. Even if the save is successful, the opponent will be at disadvantage to attack you due to the brilliant light emanating from you.

Creatures that have the trait Sunlight Sensitivity or Sunlight Hypersensitivity must make an additional Constitution saving throw, at disadvantage if they failed the first one. If they fail, they are also frightened of you for 1 minute.

Finally, undead and fiends take 2d6 radiant damage each time they end their turn within 10 feet of you.

♦ ***Crown of Flames.*** Your circlet erupts with holy fire. All aberrations, fey, fiends, and undead with evil alignment within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d8 fire damage and 4d8 radiant damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.

♦ ***Crown of Glory.*** Your circlet glows with beautiful rainbow light, inspiring awe in lesser creatures. All creatures with 50 or fewer hit points that are within 30 feet of you are automatically incapacitated for 1 minute. Creatures with 50-100 hit points may make a Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitate for 1 minute. Creatures with more than 100 hit points are immune.

Furthermore, when you speak, your words form a *suggestion*, as per the spell. All creatures who are within 30 feet of you who are incapacitated must make a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for up to 8 hours and will follow your suggestion to the best of its ability, provided that the suggestion is reasonable and non-dangerous.
