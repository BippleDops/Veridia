# High Inquisitor Maltheos
*The Zealous Purifier, Scourge of Corruption, Voice of Divine Wrath*

## Overview
High Inquisitor Maltheos leads the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Purist Coalition]], a growing religious and political movement dedicated to eradicating crystal corruption from Aethermoor. A brilliant theologian and charismatic orator, he genuinely believes that crystal technology represents a fundamental corruption of divine order. His uncompromising crusade against crystal use puts him on a collision course with [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]] and the entire royal establishment, though he remains unaware that his ultimate enemy—the Queen herself—suffers from the very corruption he seeks to destroy.
