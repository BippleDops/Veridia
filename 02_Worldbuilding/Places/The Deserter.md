# The Deserter
*A Soldier's Conscience in Exile*

> *"They called me a traitor for refusing an unjust order. I called myself a soldier for obeying a higher law. History will judge which of us was right, but I can sleep with my choices."*
> — The Deserter, to a group of refugees

## Overview

Known only as "The Deserter," this mysterious figure operates in the outer territories of [[Aquabyssos]], providing aid to refugees, outcasts, and others who exist outside conventional society. Once a decorated military officer, they abandoned their position rather than carry out orders they considered morally unacceptable, choosing exile over compromise with their principles.

The Deserter's true name and original rank remain unknown to most, as they deliberately obscure their past to protect both themselves and those they once served with. Their reputation is built on actions rather than words, earning respect through consistent help to those in need rather than explanations of their motivations.

## Background and History

### Military Service

The Deserter served with distinction in [[Aquabyssos]] military forces for over fifteen years, rising through ranks based on competence, tactical skill, and genuine concern for subordinates' welfare. Their service record included commendations for bravery, leadership, and innovative tactical solutions to complex military challenges.

Specialization in reconnaissance and special operations made them valuable for sensitive missions requiring discretion and independent judgment. This experience developed their skills in stealth, survival, and working with minimal support or oversight.

Their reputation among fellow soldiers was built on reliability, fairness, and willingness to take personal risks to protect their units and accomplish mission objectives without unnecessary casualties.

### The Breaking Point

The incident that led to their desertion involved orders to take action against civilian populations that The Deserter considered morally unacceptable. Faced with choice between following orders and violating their personal code of ethics, they chose conscience over career.

Attempts to raise concerns through proper channels were dismissed or ignored, leading to increasing isolation within the command structure and pressure to comply with policies they found objectionable.

The final break came when direct orders would have required actions against non-combatants, forcing a decision between abandoning military career or participating in activities they considered criminal.

### Life in Exile

After leaving military service, The Deserter retreated to [[Aquabyssos]]'s outer territories, establishing themselves as independent operator helping refugees, outcasts, and others who exist outside conventional society's protection.

Their military skills adapted well to this new role, providing security, guidance, and practical assistance to vulnerable populations while avoiding direct confrontation with official authorities.

Over time, their reputation spread among marginalized communities as someone who could be trusted to provide help without asking compromising questions or demanding payment beyond what recipients could afford.

## Current Activities and Operations

### Refugee Assistance

The Deserter operates an informal network providing aid to refugees from various conflicts, disasters, and political upheavals affecting the region. This assistance includes safe passage, temporary shelter, basic supplies, and connections to more permanent support systems.

Their military experience provides valuable skills for assessing threats, planning safe routes, and organizing defensive measures for vulnerable groups traveling through dangerous territory.

Coordination with other humanitarian organizations is carefully managed to avoid drawing official attention while maximizing effectiveness of aid efforts.

### Information Brokering

The Deserter's network of contacts and skills in reconnaissance make them valuable source of information about conditions in remote areas, activities of various groups, and potential threats to vulnerable populations.

This intelligence is shared selectively with those who can use it constructively, including humanitarian organizations, independent merchants, and occasionally official authorities when information could prevent harm to innocents.

Careful management of information flow helps maintain their network's security while providing maximum benefit to those they serve.

### Security Consulting

Independent groups and organizations sometimes hire The Deserter to provide security assessment, defensive planning, or protection services for sensitive operations or vulnerable installations.

This work provides income necessary to support their humanitarian activities while utilizing their military expertise for constructive purposes.

Client selection is careful, with preference for organizations whose goals align with The Deserter's values and commitment to protecting rather than exploiting vulnerable populations.

## Personality and Motivations

### Moral Compass

The Deserter is driven by strong personal ethics emphasizing protection of innocents, opposition to abuse of power, and belief that individual conscience must sometimes override institutional authority.

Their approach to moral decisions is pragmatic but principled, seeking solutions that minimize harm while acknowledging that perfect outcomes are rarely possible in complex situations.

Respect for others' autonomy and dignity shapes their interactions, treating all people as worthy of consideration regardless of social status or past mistakes.

### Protective Instincts

Having witnessed the consequences of institutional failure to protect vulnerable populations, The Deserter feels personal responsibility for filling gaps in society's safety net.

Their protective instincts extend beyond physical security to include emotional support, practical guidance, and advocacy for those unable to advocate for themselves.

This protective approach is balanced with respect for others' independence and decision-making authority, providing help while avoiding paternalistic control.

### Skepticism of Authority

Experience with institutional failure has made The Deserter deeply skeptical of official authority and formal hierarchies, preferring to evaluate individuals and organizations based on actions rather than positions or claims.

This skepticism extends to their own authority, leading them to minimize hierarchical relationships and encourage independent thinking among those they work with.

Despite distrust of institutions, they maintain respect for individuals within those institutions who demonstrate genuine commitment to positive values and constructive action.

## Secrets and Hidden Agendas

### True Identity

The Deserter's real name is Commander [[Marcus Depthward]], formerly a highly decorated special operations officer whose disappearance was officially attributed to combat casualties to protect military reputation and avoid questions about command decisions.

Official records have been altered to support this cover story, but some former colleagues know the truth and could potentially expose their identity if discovered.

Maintaining this secret is crucial both for personal safety and protection of family members who could face retaliation if The Deserter's survival and activities became known to hostile parties.

### Intelligence Network

The Deserter maintains an extensive intelligence network that includes current military personnel, government officials, and other sources providing information about official activities that could affect vulnerable populations.

This network operates through careful compartmentalization and security protocols learned during military service, making it difficult for authorities to penetrate or disrupt.

Information gathered through this network sometimes reveals classified or sensitive details about government operations, creating ethical dilemmas about how such information should be used.

### Long-term Goals

Beyond immediate humanitarian work, The Deserter is quietly documenting evidence of institutional failures and abuses that led to their exile, building case for eventual reform efforts.

This documentation is carefully hidden and protected, representing potential leverage for future negotiations or public revelations if circumstances require more direct action.

The ultimate goal involves creating systemic changes that would prevent future situations where military personnel face impossible choices between conscience and orders.
