# Hat of Vermin
*Wondrous item, common*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/hat-of-vermin.webp#right)

This hat has 3 charges. While holding the hat, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to expend 1 charge and summon your choice of a [[bat-xmm|Bat]], a [[frog-xmm|Frog]], or a [[rat-xmm|Rat]]. The summoned creature magically appears in the hat and tries to get away from you as quickly as possible. The creature is [[indifferent-attitude-xphb|Indifferent]] toward you and other creatures, and it isn't under your control. It behaves as an ordinary creature of its kind and disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]]. The hat regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
