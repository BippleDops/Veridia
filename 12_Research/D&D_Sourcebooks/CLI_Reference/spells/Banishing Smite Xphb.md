The target hit by the attack roll takes an extra `5d10` Force damage from the attack. If the attack reduces the target to 50 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] or fewer, the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be transported to a harmless demiplane for the duration. While there, the target has the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] condition. When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

**Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]
