*Adventuring gear, poison* - **Properties**: [[item properties#Poison|Poison]]
- **Cost**: 100 gp As a [[Action Xphb]], you can use a vial of Basic Poison to coat one weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. A creature that takes Piercing or Slashing damage from the poisoned weapon or ammunition takes an extra`d4`Poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute or until its damage is dealt, whichever comes first. *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 227.
