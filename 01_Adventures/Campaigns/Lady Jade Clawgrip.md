**Territorial Domice.** When in any business establishment or commercial district, Jade gains advantage on Intimidation and Persuasion checks, and her spell save DC increases by 1.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Jade fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Jade makes three attacks: two Claw strikes and one Frost Breath (if available), or she casts a spell and makes two claw attacks.

**Claw Strike.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`dice: `dice: 2d8`` + 3) slashing damage plus 7 (`dice: `dice: 2d6``) cold damage. If the target is a humanoid, they must succeed on a **DC 19** Constitution saving throw or be marked with Jade's draconic claim, giving her advantage on all social interactions with that creature for 24 hours.

**Frost Breath (Recharge 5-6).** Jade exhales freezing energy in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a **DC 19** Constitution saving throw, taking 54 (`dice: `dice: 12d8``) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Creatures that fail the save are also restrained by ice for 1 minute (can repeat the save at end of each turn).

**Corporate Domination (1/Day).** Jade targets one creature within 60 feet. The target must make a **DC 19** Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target is charmed for 24 hours and views Jade as their superior in all business matters, obeying her commercial directives as if they were their own idea.

**Hostile Takeover (1/Day).** Jade attempts to seize control of all magic items, summons, or ongoing magical effects within 60 feet that belong to other creatures. Each affected creature must make a **DC 19** Charisma saving throw. On a failure, Jade gains control of one magic item or effect of her choice for 10 minutes.

### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)

**Economic Pressure.** Jade summons the weight of economic obligation. All creatures within 60 feet must succeed on a **DC 19** Strength saving throw or be knocked prone as debts and responsibilities manifest as crushing force.

**Asset Seizure.** Jade attempts to confiscate valuable items. Each creature carrying items worth more than 100gp must succeed on a **DC 19** Charisma saving throw or have Jade gain temporary control of their most valuable possession for 1 minute.
