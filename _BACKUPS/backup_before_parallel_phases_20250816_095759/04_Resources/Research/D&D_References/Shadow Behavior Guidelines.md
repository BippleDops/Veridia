*The Moral Compass of the Depths, Keepers of Shadow Ethics, Community Standards Council* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Organization Overview The Shadow Behavior Guidelines represents the shadow-touched community's effort at self-regulation and ethical development in [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos. Founded in response to increasing concerns about shadow energy abuse and the corrupting effects of uncontrolled shadow abilities, this organization serves as both moral authority and practical regulatory body for individuals affected by shadow transformation. Unlike external authorities who may not understand the unique challenges faced by shadow-touched individuals, the Guidelines organization is composed entirely of community members who have experienced shadow transformation firsthand. They understand both the benefits and dangers of shadow abilities, creating ethical frameworks that are practical, compassionate, and effective. The organization operates on the principle that shadow-touched individuals have a responsibility to use their abilities in ways that benefit rather than harm their communities. They provide education, counseling, and enforcement services to help shadow-touched individuals navigate the complex moral and practical challenges that come with their transformed state. ### The Shadow Riots (25 years ago)

The organization emerged from a period of social chaos when uncontrolled shadow abilities led to violence and property damage throughout several Aquabyssos districts. Traditional law enforcement struggled to handle shadow-touched offenders, while the shadow community lacked any internal mechanisms for addressing problematic behavior. ### The Community Response (23 years ago)

Shadow Magistrate Umbrian Darkwise, a respected scholar who had studied shadow transformation for decades, proposed a revolutionary solution: community-based self-regulation that would address shadow-specific behavioral issues while maintaining connection to broader social structures. ### The First Codification (20 years ago)

The organization spent three years developing the **Shadow Conduct Codex**, a comprehensive ethical framework specifically designed for shadow-touched individuals. This document addressed everything from proper use of shadow abilities to community responsibilities and conflict resolution. ### The Enforcement Era (15 years ago)

As the Guidelines gained community acceptance, they developed enforcement mechanisms including shadow-specialized mediators, rehabilitation programs, and disciplinary procedures that could effectively address shadow-related behavioral problems. ### Modern Integration (5 years ago - Present)

Today, the Shadow Behavior Guidelines works closely with Aquabyssos government and law enforcement while maintaining independence and community focus. They have become the recognized authority on shadow-related ethical and legal issues. ### The Shadow Magistrate

**Umbrian Darkwise**: The founding leader and primary architect of the Shadow Conduct Codex. His own shadow transformation occurred gradually over decades of study, allowing him to maintain emotional balance and intellectual clarity while gaining deep understanding of shadow psychology. He serves as final arbiter in complex ethical disputes and maintains the organization's philosophical direction. ### The Ethics Council

The governing body consists of seven senior members, each representing different aspects of shadow community needs: #### **Responsibility with Power**

Shadow abilities grant capabilities beyond normal human limits, creating obligations to use these abilities responsibly. Power must be balanced with consideration for its impact on others and the community. #### **Community Before Self**

Individual desires and needs are important, but must be balanced against community wellbeing. Shadow-touched individuals have special responsibilities to their communities due to their enhanced capabilities. #### **Transparency and Honesty**

Shadow abilities can enable deception and manipulation. Community members must commit to honesty in their dealings with others and transparency about their abilities when relevant. #### **Consent and Autonomy**

Shadow abilities must never be used to violate others' consent or autonomy. This includes psychological manipulation, coercion, or any use of abilities that compromises others' free will. #### **Continuous Learning**

Shadow transformation is an ongoing process requiring constant adaptation and learning. Community members must commit to developing their understanding of their abilities and their ethical implications. #### **Progressive Disciplinary System**

1. **Counseling and Education**: First response to minor violations focuses on understanding and correction
2. **Community Service**: Moderate violations require contribution to community welfare projects
3. **Supervised Probation**: Serious violations result in monitored behavior and restricted activities
4. **Ability Restriction**: Severe violations may require temporary limitation of shadow abilities
5. **Community Exile**: Extreme cases may result in exclusion from shadow community support and resources ### Automatic Membership

All shadow-touched individuals within Aquabyssos are automatically considered subject to the Shadow Conduct Codex, though active participation in organization programs is voluntary. #### **[Parliament of Echoes|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/Parliament Of Echoes]]**

**Relationship**: Cooperative Partnership

The organization works closely with government officials to develop policies addressing shadow-touched community needs while maintaining operational independence. #### **Aquabyssos Law Enforcement**

**Relationship**: Defensive Conflict

Actions are evaluated based on their outcomes for community wellbeing, with emphasis on reducing harm and promoting flourishing for all community members. #### **Deontological Principles**

Certain actions (like violating consent or using abilities to harm others) are considered inherently wrong regardless of potential benefits. #### **Virtue Ethics Approach**

Emphasizes developing good character and moral wisdom rather than simply following rules, encouraging community members to internalize ethical principles. #### **Care Ethics Integration**

Recognizes special obligations to vulnerable community members and emphasizes relationships and emotional support alongside formal rules. #### **Self-Determination**

Shadow-touched individuals should have maximum autonomy over their lives while accepting responsibilities that come with enhanced abilities. #### **Collective Responsibility**

Community members share obligations for each other's wellbeing and for the reputation and safety of the shadow-touched community as a whole. #### **Integration not Isolation**
