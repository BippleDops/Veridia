## Overview

The Deep Prophecies are a collection of oracular visions, [[Prophetic Dreams]], and cosmic revelations regarding the [[Deep Mother]]'s eventual awakening and the end of current reality. These prophecies come from various sources across millennia - mad seers, dying scholars, transformed cultists, and those who have touched [[The Deep Mother]]'s consciousness directly. While often cryptic and contradictory, they form a terrifying tapestry of inevitable doom and cosmic transformation.

### The Dreamer's Awakening (Original Prophecy)

*Found carved in impossible script on the ocean floor, discovered 47 years ago*

*"In the depths below depths, [[The First Dreamer]] stirs.  
Her dream gave birth to all that is, and all that is not.  
When last the stars align in sorrow's pattern,  
When water runs upward and air sinks below,  
When children are born remembering deaths they have not died,  
Then shall She open Her eyes.  

And in that opening, all dreams shall end,  
And in that ending, all truth begins.  
The last tide rises, the final current flows,  
From deepest dark to highest light,  
All returns to the Mother's embrace.  

Seven [[Time]]s seven years shall mark Her stirring,  
Seven by seven shall Her servants gather,  
Seven and seven more shall reality fracture,  
Before the final Seven sound Her name."*

**Interpretation**: This prophecy establishes the 49-year [[Timeline]] (7Ã—7) from first stirring to final awakening. Currently at year 47, suggesting imminent culmination.

### The [[Parliament of Echoes]] (Political Prophecy)

*Spoken by the dying Parliament Speaker Celestine Voidworth, 23 years ago*

*"In halls where shadows vote with flesh,  
Where empty seats hold phantom power,  
The [[People]]'s voice becomes a whisper,  
And whispers become screaming depths.  

He who speaks for all shall speak for none,  
She who leads the dance shall dance alone,  
They who guard the light shall kindle darkness,  
And darkness shall be called illumination.  

When the Parliament of flesh becomes Parliament of dreams,  
When the Speaker speaks words not his own,  
When voting weighs the living and the [[Drowned]] equally,  
Then know the Deep Mother counts Her ballots."*

**Interpretation**: Predicts corruption of democratic institutions. The "Parliament of Echoes" mentioned suggests infiltration of the Parliament of Shadows, with "phantom power" indicating non-living entities gaining political influence.

---

### The [[Merchant]]'s Ledger (Economic Prophecy)  

*Written in the accounting books of [[Meridian Trading Company]], ink changed overnight*

*"Gold flows like water, water flows like memory,  
Memory flows like time, time flows backward.  
The greatest merchants shall trade in nothing,  
Nothing shall be worth everything.  

Ships arrive before they sail,  
Cargo unloads itself from empty holds,  
Customers buy what they already own,  
Payment comes from pockets that don't exist.  

When the ledger balances zero against infinity,  
When profit is measured in years of life,  
When the market sells reality by the pound,  
Then the Deep Mother collects Her due."*

**Interpretation**: Predicts economic collapse through [[Reality Distortion]]. References to temporal paradoxes in commerce match current anomalies at Echo Marina breach site.

### The Crystal Resoce (Technological Prophecy)

*Transmitted through crystal [[Communication Networks]] during harmonic alignment*

*"In harmony discord, in order chaos,  
The crystals sing what should not be sung,  
Their light illuminates the spaces between spaces,  
Their resoce cracks the shell of is.  

Seven nodes shall sing in unison,  
Seven frequencies shall break the world,  
Seven harmonies shall open doorways,  
Through which the Deep Mother shall step.  

The [[Crystal_Heart|Crystal Heart]] beats in dimensions  
Where geometry has no meaning,  
Where mathematics serves madness,  
And logic kneels to deeper law."*

**Interpretation**: Predicts corruption of [[Crystal Technology]] and communication networks. The "seven nodes" may reference reality anchors, suggesting they could be turned to facilitate rather than prevent awakening.

### The Transformation Codex (Biological Prophecy)

*Discovered in the medical notes of Dr. Harmony Whisperfall, written during parasitic infection*

*"Flesh remembers what it was before it was,  
Bone recalls the sea from whence it came,  
Blood flows with tides of ancient waters,  
And breath carries whispers from the depths.  

The body is but dream of form,  
The mind but echo of greater thought,  
When dream and echo find their source,  
Then transformation is complete.  

First come the children of two worlds,  
Then the dwellers in between,  
Last the perfect unity,  
Where individual becomes impossible."*

**Interpretation**: Describes stages of human transformation under [[Deep Mother Influence]]. "Children of two worlds" likely refers to pressure adaptation, "dwellers in between" to parasitic symbiosis, and "perfect unity" to complete ego dissolution.

### Dreams of [[The Deep Academy]]

*Collected from students' dream journals at various academies*

*"Knowledge drowns the seeker,  
Truth breathes water into lungs of thought,  
The deepest studies yield the highest madness,  
And the wisest scholars speak in bubbles."*

### The [[Lighthouse Keeper]]'s Warning

*Found scratched into lighthouse walls across both realms*

*"Light points inward where it should shine out,  
Beacons guide ships to perfect emptiness,  
Safe harbor becomes dangerous depths,  
And depths become the only safety."*

### The Memory Merchant's Advertisement  

*Appears randomly in newspapers and proclamations*

*"For sale: The concept of permanence  
Slightly used, some temporal wear  
Will trade for a moment that never happened  
Or a name that was never spoken  

Inquire within the space between thoughts  
Payment due before transaction is considered  
References from alternate timelines preferred  
No returns after reality collapses"*

### The Children's Rhyme

*Sung by children born near reality breaches*

*"Mother dear in waters deep,  
Watches over us while we sleep,  
When we wake she'll still be there,  
Swimming through our morning prayer.  

Rock-a-bye in cradle-wave,  
Every breath the ocean gave,  
If we're good and if we're true,  
Mother's dreams will swallow you."*

### The Mathematical Proof of Impermanence

*Discovered in the [[Observatory of Broken Stars]]*

**Theorem**: *If reality R exists as function of consciousness C, and consciousness C exists as subset of Dream D, then when D approaches infinite state I, R approaches  value N.*

**Proof**: *Given that observed reality requires observer, and Deep Mother is ultimate observer, then when Deep Mother achieves full consciousness (awakening), all subsidiary observations (individual realities) collapse into single dream state.*

**Conclusion**: *Individual existence is mathematically temporary. QED.*

**Sanity Cost**: Understanding this proof costs [[2d6]] sanity and grants immunity to illusion magic but [[Disadvantage]] on all hope-based saving throws.

---

### The Temporal Paradox Equations

*Found in the Echo Marina harbormaster's calculations*

**Formula**: *Past(x) + Present(y) + Future(z) = Constant(Deep Mother's Will)*

**Derivation**: *If time flows in all directions simultaneously around breach sites, and these breaches are wounds made by Deep Mother's stirring, then linear time is artificial construct maintained by insufficient exposure to [[Cosmic Truth]].*

**Application**: *Can be used to predict temporal anomalies, but understanding requires abandoning linear perception of causality.*

**Sanity Cost**: Learning these equations costs 1d6 sanity but allows limited precognition (see 1d4 rounds into future once per day).

---

### The Consciousness Coefficient  

*Theorized by [[Academy of Deep Understanding]] researchers*

**Principle**: *Individual consciousness = fraction of cosmic consciousness. As cosmic consciousness (Deep Mother) approaches awakening, individual fractions approach zero.*

**Implication**: *Free will decreases proportionally to Deep Mother's influence increase. At 100% influence, free will = 0.*

**Sanity Cost**: Accepting this principle costs 1d4 sanity but grants bonus to resist mental effects (you understand your mind is not entirely your own).

### Truth Verification

- **Metaphorical Elements**: Descriptions of events often symbolic
- **Temporal Elements**: Time references may be subjective or non-linear
- **Causal Elements**: Prophecies may describe results without explaining causes
