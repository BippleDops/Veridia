# Wrath of Nature
*5th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You call out to the spirits of nature to rouse them against your enemies. Choose a point you can see within range. The spirits cause trees, rocks, and grasses in a 60-foot cube centered on that point to become animated until the spell ends.

## Grasses and Undergrowth

Any area of ground in the cube that is covered by grass or undergrowth is difficult terrain for your enemies.

## Trees

At the start of each of your turns, each of your enemies within 10 feet of any tree in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `4d6` slashing damage from whipping branches.

## Roots and Vines

At the end of each of your turns, one creature of your choice that is on the ground in the cube must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become [[conditions#Restrained|restrained]] until the spell ends. A [[conditions#Restrained|restrained]] creature can use an action to make a Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Rocks

As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause a loose rock in the cube to launch at a creature you can see in the cube. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `3d8` nonmagical bludgeoning damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall [[conditions#Prone|prone]].
