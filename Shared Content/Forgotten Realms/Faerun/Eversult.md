# `=this.file.name`
## Overview
Elversult (pronounced: /ˈɛlvɛrsəlt/ EL-ver-suhlt) was a rich community found in the Dragon Coast region of Faerûn. It was an important trading up and mercantile center, that facilitated both honest and illegitimate trade across the Eastern Heartlands and beyond.

Beyond its reputation as a great trade city and hotspot of the latest trends, Elversult was known across nearly all of Faerûn as the birthplace of the renewed church of Amaunator and the god's second sun that shone bright in the skies above.

## Geography 
The city was found on the south side of the Dragonmere at the junction of many trade roads that connected the main routes of the lands between the Sea of Fallen Stars, the rest of the Dragon Coast, through the Western Heartlands, as far west as the Sword Coast.

Roads leading to the city included the Overmoor Trail, south from Proskur; the Trader's Road, west from the Sunset Vale by means of Priapurl and east from Teziir, the Plunge, south from the ruins of Ilipur, and Turnstone Road, southwest from Pros.

### Geographical Features 
Geographical Features
Elversult was founded at the confluence of a number of freshwater ponds that were set between rolling hills and forested ridges. A rocky tor known as Temple Hill in the center of Elversult overlooked the city environs, which lacking walls sprawled beyond the woodlands. The hill was named for the pair of holy houses that sat atop its apex, which were dedicated to the deities of Waukeen and Lathander.

The combination of Elversult being a relatively new, as of the Era of Upheaval, and having enjoyed strong leadership throughout its history, lead to the preservation of the wooded glades and knolls which were scattered through the city.

### Relationships
Throughout its history, Elversult has had regular conflicts with the coastal city of Westgate, often receiving aid from the noble kingdom of Cormyr to the northeast. Foreign nations from the Unapproachable East such as Impiltur and even Thay were known to have spies operating within the city's borders.

Inhabitants of Calimshan often called Elversians as Elversultians, which was considered an insult.

### Trade

From its central location at the crossroads between a number of important mercantile destinations, Elversult dominated overland trade in the region. In addition to its importance in legitimate trade in the region, the city was a haven for smugglers and others looking to move products that were not entirely legal in the Heartlands.

Although not a port itself, the city kept its warehouses full of trade goods that went as far away as Cormyr and the Sword Coast. Plenty of caravan paddocks and stockyards could be found on the outskirts of the city.

### Society
The bustling city was a melting pot for cultures from across half of Faerûn, a place where travelers could readily get a read on the latest trends in trade, fads in fashion, or other current goings-on.

While Elversian leaders did their best to maintain the city's reputation as one of honest trade and one that was worthy of respect, its more nefarious citizens did all they could to make this task as difficult as possible.

The upper classes tended to live to the north, or the west of Temple Hill, around the 'Ladytower's Lands' that surrounded the "Ladytowers", or Moonstorm House. The the poorer areas and warehouses tended to be found in the the south and eastern parts of the city.

### Defenses
Elversult boasted a strong military force of some 3,500 warriors known as the Maces. They acted as both a local law enforcement and the city guard that protected Elversians from exterior threats. They patrolled the city in five-man units, ready to rapidly call down reinforcements if a strong-enough threat presented itself.

### History
The Cult of the Dragon established a cell within the city in the Year of the Winged Worm, 1225 DR, and allied themselves with the black dragon Hethcypressarvil. The cultists were known to run the city's black market of foreign spices, along with illicit drugs and poisons. After undergoing the process to become a dracolich, the cultist's patron dragon took control of the group and manipulated them towards his own ends, a dynamic that continued for over a hundred years into the mid–14th century DR.

The Book of Fangs and Talons appeared in Elversult in the Year of the Pointed Bone, 1298 DR, when a group of Malarites began using the city as a base for their operations in nearby lands.

Elversult suffered great destruction at the hands of the Dracolich Hethcypressarvil, in the Year of the Wave, 1364 DR. The undead dragon was briefly defeated by the Maces with the aid of the Harper sorceress Ruha, and its remains were submerged beneath the small lake near Temple Hill.

In the Year of Rogue Dragons, 1373 DR, the Elversian embassy of the Shou Lung empire was suddenly destroyed. A scroll was later recovered from the rubble that bore the seal of the first emperor, Ra-Khati.

One year later, during the month of Mirtul, Sunlord Daelegoth Orndeir beseeched Amaunator for a miracle to cease the draughts that plagued much of the Realms. In the following days Elversult received tremendous amounts of rainfall and beauteous weather that followed. On the day of Midsummer he called for his fellow faithful to take witness to Amaunator's glory and summoned forth a second sun that ascended over the city and provided illumination to the city at all hours of the day.

## Inhabitants
The herald of Elversult held the title of "Purple Halberd".

One notable criminal organization that operated in the city during the mid–14th century was the band of thieves known as the Purple Masks.
