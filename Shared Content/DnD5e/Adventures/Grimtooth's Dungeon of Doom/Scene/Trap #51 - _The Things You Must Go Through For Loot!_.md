# Trap #51 - "The Things You Must Go Through For Loot!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> Behind the bier on the wall opposite [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] there is another three finger hole door behind the tiles. Pry out the tiles and the door can be opened. The door opens into the ''Blue" room. and reveals a small chamber 10 by 10 by 10 feet in size. On the opposite side is a bronze door. (Remember, most of the rooms are in dead blackness.)
> 
> This door again depicts Evinrood and a beautiful woman: This woman seems to be possessed of a flashy quickness that seems to leap out of the image. In the background can be seen a number of indistinct catlike figures lying about or rubbing against the figures legs.
> 
> a number of indistinct catlike figures lying about or rubbing against the figures legs. In the centerof the door is a wheel which must be turned to open the portal. The w heel will not turn until the door to the "Blue" room is closed. Once this has been done the wheel will turn freely. The wheel will make several turns, then there will sound a sudden click. At this point the ceiling will begin to descend into the room.
> 
> This will cause almost certain panic. lndestructable items can be used to block the descending stone. The party can also attack the three finger hole door with some hope of success. Keep in mind it is fairly thick (6 inches of stone) and this could take some time.
> 
> Once the ceiling reaches a point about 5 feet down from the top the wheel will be snapped off the bronze door. Steel panels will fall out of the base of the wall. These panels reveal gratings about 6 inches high along both sides of the room. At this point the Water Dogs and the Tsunami Warrior can quit worrying: there is their refuge. The others have a very short time to look for an escape.
> 
> This room was designed to "wring" the water out of anything entering the next room. This works very well for other liquids as well, and most delvers will be liquids by the time the stone reaches the floor one way or another.
> 
> In any event the ceiling will withdraw once it has been effectively stopped. Once the ceiling is back in place the thick steel bolts will be withdrawn and the vault like door will open. Not that this will matter to the tomb robbers at this point.
> 
> This room is hydraulically driven once the wheel is turned, and also hydraulically raised once it stops. The room is a four skuller if there are none of those cursed indestructible items amongst the party.
