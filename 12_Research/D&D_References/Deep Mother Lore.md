*"She is the first current, the deepest darkness, the womb of all seas."*

## Overview
Deep Mother Lore encompasses the collected knowledge, myths, prophecies, and religious teachings about the primordial oceanic entity known as the Deep Mother.

## Player-Facing Summary

Deep Mother Lore is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Deep Mother Lore as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Deep Mother Lore.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
