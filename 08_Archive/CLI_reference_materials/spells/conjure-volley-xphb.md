# Conjure Volley
*5th-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a Melee or Ranged weapon worth at least 1 CP)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You brandish the weapon used to cast the spell and choose a point within range. Hundreds of similar spectral weapons (or ammunition appropriate to the weapon) fall in a volley and then disappear. Each creature of your choice that you can see in a 40-foot-radius, 20-foot-high [Cylinder](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `8d8` Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Classes**: [Ranger](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md)
