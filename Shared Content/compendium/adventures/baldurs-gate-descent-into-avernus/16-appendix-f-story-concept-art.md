# Appendix F: Story Concept Art
*Source: Baldur's Gate: Descent Into Avernus, p. 246* 

In the months before writing began on _Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus_, art director Richard Whitters invited a handful of concept illustrators to create characters, creatures, objects, and environments based on conversations with Adam Lee (the story lead) and other members of the D&D team. These artists included Aleksi Briclot, Daarken, Max Dunbar, Titus Lunter, Vince Proce, and Shawn Wood. Their illustrations helped inspire the writers and laid the groundwork for a story guide used by our licencing partners. This appendix showcases some of their excellent work.
