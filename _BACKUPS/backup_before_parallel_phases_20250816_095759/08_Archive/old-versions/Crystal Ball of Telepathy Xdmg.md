*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)* - **Weight**: 3.0 lbs. While touching this crystal orb, you can cast [[Scrying Xphb (save **DC 17**) with it. In addition, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also cast [Suggestion Xphb]] (save **DC 17**) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this [[Suggestion Xphb to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if [Scrying Xphb]] ends. You can't cast [[Suggestion Xphb in this way again until the next dawn. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 159.
