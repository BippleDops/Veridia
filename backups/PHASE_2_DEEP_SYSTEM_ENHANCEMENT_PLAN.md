## Section I: Reality Blending Mechanics

### Overview
The merger of Aquabyssos and Aethermoor isn't just a plot point—it's a revolutionary gameplay system where reality itself becomes malleable, dangerous, and full of opportunity.

### 1.1 Cross-World Travel Consequence Systems

#### **Dimensional Anchoring Mechanics**
```
Base System Framework:
- Each character has a "Reality Anchor" value (0-100)
- Starting value: 50 (perfectly balanced)
- Aquabyssos pulls toward 0, Aethermoor toward 100
- Extreme values cause transformation
```

**Implementation Details**:
- **Anchor Drift Table**: Daily/weekly drift based on location and actions

- **Anchor Penalties**: Disadvantages in opposite-aligned realms
- **Anchor Items**: Equipment that stabilizes or shifts anchor values
- **Anchor Rituals**: Ceremonies to reset or manipulate anchoring

#### **Pressure-Wind Adaptation Tracking**
```
Dual Environment System:
- Pressure Tolerance: 0-10 (Aquabyssos adaptation)
- Wind Resistance: 0-10 (Aethermoor adaptation)
- Combined score cannot exceed 15 (body limitation)
- Adaptation causes counter-adaptation loss
```

**Mechanical Features**:
- **Adaptation Sickness**: Penalties during transition periods
- **Hybrid Zones**: Areas requiring both adaptations
- **Adaptation Accelerators**: Items/spells speeding adaptation
- **Permanent Adaptations**: Irreversible changes at extremes
- **Adaptation Memory**: Body "remembers" previous adaptations

#### **Temporal Displacement Effects**
```
Time Flow Differential:
- Aquabyssos: 1 day = 20 hours (pressure compression)
- Aethermoor: 1 day = 28 hours (wind expansion)
- Merger Zones: Variable time (1d12+14 hours)
- Temporal Stress accumulates with transitions
```

**Gameplay Impact**:
- **Jet Lag Mechanics**: Mental exhaustion from time shifts
- **Appointment Confusion**: Social encounters complicated

4-5: Minor shift (reality weakens)
6-8: Stable (no change)
9-10: Strengthening (reality solidifies)
11-12: Convergence event (special table)
```

#### **Reality Combat Modifiers**
```
Combat in Unstable Reality:
