## Description
Also calling Halfling’s Cheese, mind cheese, or cheeeeese, this cheese is available on a limited basis in Waterdeep only, and then only with the express written permission of Lord Piergeiron, Khelben Arunsun, or the patriarch of an established temple. While not the most pleasing of cheeses to the human palate, its effects on halflings is markedly different, inducing a state in them similar to strong wine. Pungently aromatic and soft, it is normally eaten as an aperitif, though recipes for fondues and pasta do exist which are palatable to humans. In small doses it is less dangerous, but bring a notarized note before even thinking about buying some. Available by the half-pound loaf ONLY, and ONLY in Waterdeep station, (40 gp).

## Additional Details
Luiren Spring Cheese: Has no effect on any other races than halflings. Effect of 4 oz. amount on halflings: -2 on all proficiency checks and combat rolls, -20% on all thief abilities. Effect of ½ lb or more; as above, plus saving throw versus death or unconsciousness for 1-10 turns. Luiren Spring Cheese causes strong cravings, and the halfling eating it must make a Constitution Check to avoid this effect. Failure indicates need for additional cheese within 24 hours, or else the halfling loses half hit points and suffers painful cramps and hallucinations. USE WITH CAUTION.
