# Bones of the Earth
*6th-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target the ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10-foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.

If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes `6d6` bludgeoning damage and is [[conditions#Restrained|restrained]], pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The [[conditions#Restrained|restrained]] creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature's choice) against the spell's save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer [[conditions#Restrained|restrained]] and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can create two additional pillars for each slot level above 6th.

**Classes**: [[list-spells-classes-druid|Druid]]; [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]
