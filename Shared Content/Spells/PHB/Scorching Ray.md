# Scorching Ray
You create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range. You can hurl them at one target or several.

Make a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes `dice: 2d6|avg` (2d6) fire damage.


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot level above 2nd.
