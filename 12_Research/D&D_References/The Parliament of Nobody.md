The Parliament of Nobody represents the ultimate expression of [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]'s shadow-touched nature - a governing body where identity itself becomes fluid and representatives speak for those who have been erased, forgotten, or never existed. This phantom legislature meets in the spaces between spaces, making decisions that affect the living world while remaining completely removed from conventional power structures. They are the voice of the voiceless, the representation of the unrepresented, and the democracy of the discarded. ### Foundation in Absence (350 Years Ago)

**The Great Forgetting**
- Formed when [[The Deep Mother|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]] first experimented with memory erasure
- Original members were citizens whose existence was accidentally deleted

- Built their first chamber in a pocket of forgotten space ### The Shadow Constitution (300 Years Ago)

**Rights of the Non-Existent**
- Drafted the [[Charter of Rights]] governing those erased from reality
- Established voting procedures for incorporeal citizens
