# Zephyr Goldwhisper

*"Every crisis is an opportunity, every shard a investment, and every secret has a price. Speaking of which, what's your budget?"*

## Overview
Zephyr Goldwhisper operates as a merchant prince's representative while secretly serving as a spy for the Goldspire Confederacy, a powerful nation across the sea watching Aethermoor's crystal crisis with calculating interest. Their shop, "Zephyr's Zinc & Wonders," serves as both a legitimate business and an intelligence hub.

## Appearance
- 3'2" with meticulously waxed orange mustache
- Wears expensive but practical clothing with hidden pockets
- Multiple crystal-powered gadgets hanging from belts and bandoliers
- Mechanical left eye that whirs when analyzing things
- Carries a cane that's actually a disguised crystal-resonance detector

## Personality
- Relentlessly cheerful and talkative, using verbosity to hide true intentions
- Genuinely excited by innovation and crystal-technology
- Morally flexible but honors contracts absolutely
- Treats everything as a transaction, including friendships

## Relationships
- **[[Vex Shadowthorn]]**: Business rival and occasional partner in extremely profitable ventures
- **[[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]**: Sells her corruption-hiding cosmetics while gathering intelligence
- **[[Captain Lyanna Brightshield]]**: Provides her with "tips" about competitors' illegal activities
- **[[Archdruid Thornweaver]]**: Surprisingly cordial relationship - trades information about crystal-resistant plants
- **[[Sir Marcus Dawnforge]]**: Supplies his underground railroad with untraceable funds
- **[[Ambassador Korvin Blacktide]]**: Engaged in a careful dance of mutual espionage

## Current Activities
- Cataloguing the economic impact of crystal corruption for foreign investors
- Smuggling stable crystal samples to the Goldspire Confederacy
- Building a network of "business associates" (spies) throughout Aethermoor
- Developing crystal-powered communication devices for long-distance trade

## DM Secrets
> [!warning] The Goldspire Agenda
> The Goldspire Confederacy has authorized Zephyr to orchestrate Aethermoor's economic dependency on foreign aid. They're deliberately creating supply shortages to make Aethermoor reliant on Goldspire imports, planning eventual economic colonization.

> [!danger] The Backup Plan
> Zephyr has hidden several "Null Bombs" throughout [[Port Meridian]] - devices that can temporarily nullify all crystal energy in a mile radius. The Confederacy plans to use these if Aethermoor's crystal crisis threatens to spread internationally.

> [!info] Personal Conflict
> Zephyr is genuinely growing fond of several Aethermoor citizens and increasingly conflicted about their mission. They've started withholding certain intelligence from the Confederacy and may be turned into a double agent with the right approach.
