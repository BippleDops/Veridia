## Overview
The Tidal Shard of Memory stands as one of [[The Seven Shards]], representing the fundamental power of memory, experience, and the continuity of consciousness across time. This deep blue-green crystal pulses with the rhythm of tides and contains within its faceted depths the accumulated memories of countless beings. Unlike simple memory storage, the Shard represents living memoryâ€”experiences that continue to grow, evolve, and influence reality even after their original owners have passed on.
