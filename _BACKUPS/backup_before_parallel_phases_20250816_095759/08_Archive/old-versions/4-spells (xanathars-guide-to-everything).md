--- # Spells

*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything, p. 147* Many of the character classes in the player's handbook harness magic in the form of spells. This chapter provides new spells for those classes, as well as for spellcasting monsters. The Dungeon Master decides which of these spells are available in a campaign and how they can be learned. For example, a DM might decide that some of the spells are freely available, that others are unobtainable, and that a handful can be found only after a special quest, perhaps discovered in a long-lost tome of magic. Wizard spells, in particular, can be introduced to a campaign in spellbooks found as treasure. When a DM adds spells to a campaign, clerics, druids, and paladins require special consideration. When characters of those classes prepare their spells, they have access to the entire spell list for their class. Given that fact, the DM should be cautious about making all of these new spells available to a player who is overwhelmed when presented with many options. For such a player, consider adding only story-appropriate spells to the spell list of that player's character. See the full list of spells from *Xanathar's Guide to Everything* on the Spells page. > [!quote] A quote from Xanathar > > So why can't people who use magic do it all the time?

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of 4 spells as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around 4 spells. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - The authorities needs help delivering before winter
