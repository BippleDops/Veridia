# Fire Arrows (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a handful of sand and a drop of your spittle)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You point at a fire within range and it explodes into fiery missiles, which fly up to 30 feet away. All creatures within that range must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d4 fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a failed one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, this does an additional 1d4 damage for each slot level above 2nd.
