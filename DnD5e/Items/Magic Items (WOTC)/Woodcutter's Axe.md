# Woodcutter's Axe

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Martial Weapon, Melee Weapon, Greataxe

**Rarity:** rare

**Weight**: 7 lbs.

**Damage:** 1d12 slashing

## Description

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

When you use this axe to make an attack against a plant (an ordinary plant or a creature with the Plant type) or a wooden object that isn't being worn or carried, the attack deals an extra `dice: 2d6` slashing damage on a hit.

**Heavy.** Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

**Two-Handed.** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
