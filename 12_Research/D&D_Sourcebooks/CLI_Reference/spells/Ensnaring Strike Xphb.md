# Ensnaring Strike
*1st-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

As you hit the target, grasping vines appear on it, and it makes a Strength saving throw. A Large or larger creature has [[advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on this save. On a failed save, the target has the [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition until the spell ends. On a successful save, the vines shrivel away, and the spell ends.

While [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]], the target takes `d6` Piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. The target or a creature within reach of it can take an action to make a Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the spell ends.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d6` for each spell slot level above 1.

**Classes**: [[list-spells-classes-ranger|Ranger]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-the-ancients-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Paladin (Oath of the Ancients)]]
