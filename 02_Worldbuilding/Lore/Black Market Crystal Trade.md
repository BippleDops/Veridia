# Black Market Crystal Trade

## Overview

The Crystal Plague crisis has created a thriving underground economy built on desperation, hope, and exploitation. Where legitimate medicine fails, black market traders offer alternatives - some genuine, most fraudulent, all dangerous. This shadow economy operates parallel to official treatment systems, serving those who cannot afford legal care or who have lost faith in conventional medicine.

## Market Structure

### The Three Tiers

#### Tier 1: The Cure Peddlers (Street Level)
**Operators:** Small-time criminals, desperate citizens, con artists  
**Products:** Fake cures, contaminated samples, stolen medical supplies  
**Prices:** 5-50 gold pieces  
**Risk Level:** High (poor quality, frequent law enforcement raids)

*Typical Customer:* Working-class families who cannot afford legitimate treatment

#### Tier 2: The Corruption Brokers (Mid-Level)
**Operators:** Organized criminal syndicates, corrupt officials, rogue researchers  
**Products:** Experimental treatments, stolen research data, quality medical equipment  
**Prices:** 100-1,000 gold pieces  
**Risk Level:** Moderate (better quality control, professional security)

*Typical Customer:* Wealthy merchants, minor nobles, government officials

#### Tier 3: The Shadow Consortium (Elite Level)
**Operators:** International crime organizations, foreign intelligence, corrupt nobility  
**Products:** Genuine experimental cures, advanced magical treatments, complete identity changes  
**Prices:** 5,000+ gold pieces  
**Risk Level:** Low (high-quality products, political protection)

*Typical Customer:* Major nobles, wealthy merchants, foreign dignitaries

### Primary Trade Routes

#### The Harbor Circuit
**Route:** Port Meridian docks → Warehouse District → Noble Quarter  
**Products:** Smuggled medical supplies, stolen research specimens  
**Key Players:** Dockworker syndicates, corrupt customs officials

#### The Diplomatic Channel
**Route:** Foreign embassies → Private estates → International networks  
**Products:** Advanced foreign treatments, experimental procedures, exile services  
**Key Players:** Diplomatic staff, international crime syndicates  
**Security:** Diplomatic immunity, high-level political connections

*Current Investigation:* The Royal Intelligence Service suspects the Aethermoor embassy of running treatments in exchange for state secrets, but diplomatic immunity prevents direct investigation.

## Key Players

### The Merchant Prince - Lord Aldric Goldcurrent

**Age:** 47  
**Background:** Legitimate shipping magnate turned black market kingpin  
**Motivation:** Daughter contracted Stage 3 plague; legal treatment failed  
**Resources:** Fleet of merchant vessels, network of corrupt officials  
**Territory:** Controls 60% of harbor-based smuggling operations

Lord Goldcurrent maintains a facade of legitimate business while operating the most sophisticated medical smuggling network in Port Meridian. His public persona as a grieving father seeking help for his daughter provides perfect cover for criminal operations.

*Current Operations:*
- Imports experimental treatments from foreign nations
- Maintains private medical facility for elite clients
- Bribes customs officials to ignore "medical supply" shipments
- Funds [[Medical Research Facilities|underground research]] through shell companies

*Personal Code:* Never sells completely fake cures - his products are either genuine or clearly labeled as experimental. This reputation for "honest dishonesty" has made him the most trusted name in black market medicine.

#### The Golden Harbor Warehouse

**Location:** Pier 12, heavily guarded compound  
**Cover Story:** Legitimate medical supply importation  
**Security:** 20 armed guards, magical detection wards, escape tunnels  
**Inventory:** Current stock worth approximately 50,000 gold pieces

*Ground Floor:* Legitimate medical supplies provide cover for inspections  
*Basement Level 1:* High-value contraband and experimental treatments  
*Basement Level 2:* Private medical facility with three treatment rooms  
*Hidden Sub-Level:* Emergency escape route connects to harbor tunnel system

### The Alchemist - Dr. Marcus Shadowmend

**Age:** 39  
**Background:** Former Royal Academy researcher, expelled for unethical experiments  
**Specialization:** Chemical and magical plague treatments  
**Base of Operations:** Mobile laboratory hidden in converted sewage treatment facility  
**Client Base:** Mid-tier customers seeking experimental cures

Dr. Shadowmend was expelled from the [[Medical Research Facilities|Royal Academy]] for conducting unauthorized human experimentation. Rather than abandon his research, he took it underground, developing treatments that official medicine considers too dangerous to attempt.

*Signature Products:*
- **Crystal Dissolvent:** Chemical compound that breaks down Stage 1-2 formations (30% success rate, 15% fatality rate)
- **Transformation Accelerator:** Speeds up plague progression to Stage 5 for terminally ill patients who prefer quick transcendence
- **Symbiosis Serum:** Experimental treatment that attempts to preserve consciousness during crystallization

*Client Testimonial - Anonymous Stage 3 Patient:*
"Dr. Shadowmend's treatment hurt like being torn apart and rebuilt, but the crystals stopped growing. The official doctors said I had weeks to live. That was six months ago."

#### The Underground Laboratory Complex

**Location:** Abandoned mine shaft, three levels below street  
**Security:** Magical concealment, trapped access points, loyal guards  
**Equipment:** Stolen and improvised research apparatus worth 25,000 gold pieces

#### The Information Network

**Communication System:** Coded messages through legitimate business channels  
**Security:** Dead drops, coded language, multiple identity covers  
**Sources:** 47 active informants in medical and research institutions  
**Archives:** Complete intelligence files on 500+ individuals involved in plague response

*Network Security Measures:*
- All informants know only their immediate handler
- Information compartmentalized to prevent complete network exposure

## Adventure Hooks

### The Desperate Family
The party encounters a working-class family whose child has contracted the plague. They cannot afford legitimate treatment and are considering black market alternatives. The family asks the party to investigate a "miracle cure" being sold in the warehouse district.

*Complications:*
- The cure is partially genuine but extremely dangerous
- The seller is actually an undercover law enforcement agent
- A [[Crystal Cult Temples|crystal cult]] is using the family as recruitment targets
- The child's condition is deteriorating rapidly while they investigate

### The Research Theft
Important plague research has been stolen from a [[Medical Research Facilities|major research facility]]. The party must navigate the black market to recover the data before it's sold to foreign interests or used for harmful purposes.

*Investigation Leads:*
