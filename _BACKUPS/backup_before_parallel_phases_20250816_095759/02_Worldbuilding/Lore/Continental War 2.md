# Continental War
*The Conflict That Shaped Modern Aethermoor*

## Overview

The Continental War (892-901, Third Age) stands as the most devastating military conflict in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor's recorded history, fundamentally reshaping the political, technological, and magical landscape of the entire continent. What began as a succession dispute in the ancient Kingdom of Drakmoor escalated into a nine-year struggle that drew in every major power, introduced revolutionary military technologies, and ultimately established the modern balance of power between [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven]], [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Ironhold, [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]], and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Sylvanheart.

The war is remembered not only for its unprecedented scale and brutality but also for the innovations it produced: the [02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Ancient Siege Tunnels]], crystal-powered weaponry, organized military intelligence networks, and the first systematic use of magical warfare on a continental scale.

## Causes & Origins

### The Drakmoor Succession Crisis
The immediate cause of the war was the death of King Valorian the Great of Drakmoor without a clear heir:
- **Prince Cassius the Bold**: Supported by military commanders and northern provinces
- **Princess Serenity the Wise**: Backed by merchants and southern trading cities
- **Duke Mordain the Ruthless**: Foreign-supported claimant with promises of territorial concessions
- **The Royal Council**: Attempted to establish a regency but lacked popular support

### Deeper Tensions
The succession crisis merely sparked conflicts that had been building for decades:

**Resource Competition**: Control over crystal mining rights and trade routes
**Technological Rivalries**: Different approaches to magical and military advancement
**Religious Conflicts**: Disputes between traditional faiths and emerging magical philosophies
**Colonial Expansion**: Competition for influence over distant territories and trading posts

### The Alliance System
As the crisis deepened, major powers chose sides:

**The Northern Alliance**: [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven, [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Ironhold]], early [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian
**The Southern Coalition**: Drakmoor loyalists, several city-states, mercenary companies
**The Eastern Powers**: Foreign kingdoms seeking to exploit Aethermoor's weakness
**The Neutral Bloc**: [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Sylvanheart]] and forest communities (initially)
