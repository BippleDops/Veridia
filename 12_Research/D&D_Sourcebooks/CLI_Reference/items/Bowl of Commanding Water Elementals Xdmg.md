# Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/bowl-of-commanding-water-elementals.webp#right)

While this bowl is filled with water and you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to summon a [[water-elemental-xmm|Water Elemental]]. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the bowl as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your [[initiative-xphb|Initiative]] count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]]. The bowl can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It holds about 3 gallons.
