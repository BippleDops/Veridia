# Fiery Eyes (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *cantrip*

**School**: *Evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
Your eyes glow with unnatural fire— they’re so bright, they project bright light to a range of 5 feet around you. You may choose what color they burn. These fiery eyes have several functions.

If you stare at one spot for three rounds, any combustible materials in that spot burst into flame.

If you look into the eyes of another creature within 10 feet, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or become incapacitated for 1 round due to being fascinated by the unearthly light.

If this spell is active while you cast a spell or use an ability that charms a target, and that target is within 30 feet and can see your eyes, it has disadvantage to its saving throw against the charm.
