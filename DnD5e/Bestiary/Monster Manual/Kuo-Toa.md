## Special Traits
***Amphibious.*** The kuo-toa can breathe air and water.

***Otherworldly Perception.*** The kuo-toa can sense the presence of any creature within 30 feet of it that is invisible or on the Ethereal Plane. It can pinpoint such a creature that is moving.

***Slippery.*** The kuo-toa has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the kuo-toa has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions
***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (`dice: 1d4+1`) piercing damage.

***Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (`dice: 1d6+1`) piercing damage, or 5 (`dice: 1d8+1`) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Net.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, range 5/15 ft., one Large or smaller creature. Hit: The target is restrained. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check to free itself or another creature in a net, ending the effect on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) frees the target without harming it and destroys the net.

## Reactions
***Sticky Shield.*** When a creature misses the kuo-toa with a melee weapon attack, the kuo-toa uses its sticky shield to catch the weapon. The attacker must succeed on a DC 11 Strength saving throw, or the weapon becomes stuck to the kuo-toa's shield. If the weapon's wielder can't or won't let go of the weapon, the wielder is grappled while the weapon is stuck. While stuck, the weapon can't be used. A creature can pull the weapon free by taking an action to make a DC 11 Strength check and succeeding.
