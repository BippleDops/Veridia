## Description
One of our standard, top-of-the-line boot types, these high boots come in two main styles: hard and soft. Either style comes to just above the knee, with a fold-down flaring cuff. The hard boots are constructed of toughened boiled leather, and sell for 3 gp, while the soft ones are made of leather-reinforced kid, and go for 1 gp. You can also purchase high boots made of sheepskin or other animal pelt, such as the barbarians usually wear, for 4 gp. Any one of these boot types can have a dagger sheath sewn into them for 1 gp each.
