## The Nature of the Deep Mother

### Who Is the Deep Mother?

The Deep Mother is not a creature, not a god, not even a being in any sense mortals understand. She is:

- **The Original Dreamer**: Reality exists within her sleeping mind
- **The Void Before Creation**: The darkness that was before light
- **The Womb of Horrors**: Birth-giver to all nightmares
- **The Final Truth**: That existence itself is temporary
- **The Inevitable Return**: All things dissolve back into her

### Her Many Names

Different cultures know her by different titles:
- **Aquabyssos**: "The Depth That Dreams"
- **Aethermoor**: "The Shadow Behind Stars"
- **Ancient Mer-Folk**: "Mother of the First Waters"
- **Crystal Cults**: "The Resonance Beyond"
- **Parasite Priests**: "The Host of All"
- **Mad Prophets**: "She Who Waits Below"

### Power Scale

The Deep Mother operates on a scale beyond normal game mechanics:

| Aspect | Rating | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Divine Rank | Beyond | Not a deity, but what deities fear |
| CR | N/A | Cannot be fought directly |
| Hit Points | Infinite | Is reality itself |
| Influence | 0-100 | Current awakening level |
| Manifestations | Variable | Physical forms in reality |

### The Awakening Timeline

**Current Status**: 34% Awakened (Campaign Session 10)

| Influence | State | World Effects |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| 0-10% | Deep Sleep | No direct influence |
| 11-25% | Stirring | Dreams leak into reality |
| 26-40% | **Restless** | Avatars manifest |
| 41-60% | Half-Awake | Reality becomes unstable |
| 61-80% | Rising | Apocalyptic events |
| 81-99% | Nearly Awake | Final countdown |
| 100% | AWAKE | Campaign ends (varies) |

## Manifestation Mechanics

### Manifestation Types
