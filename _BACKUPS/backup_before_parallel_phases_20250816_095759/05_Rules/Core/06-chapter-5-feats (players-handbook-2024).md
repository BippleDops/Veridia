--- # Chapter 5: Feats

*Source: Adventurer's Codex (2024), p. 199* !] This chapter offers a collection of feats, which are special features not tied to a character class. A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. The sections below explain the parts of a feat and list a variety of feat options separated into categories. Your background gives you a feat, and at certain levels, your class gives you the "Ability Score Improvement" feat or the choice of another feat for which you qualify. By whatever means you acquire a feat, you can take it only once unless its description says otherwise. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Feat Descriptions This chapter's feats are organized by category—"Origin", "General", "Fighting Style", or "Epic Boon"—and alphabetized in each category. All the feats are listed alphabetically in the "Feat List table". If a feat can be taken more than once, an asterisk appears after its name in that table. ### Parts of a Feat The description of a feat contains the following parts, which are presented after the feat's name. #### Category A feat is a member of a category, which is noted in the feat. If you're instructed to choose a feat from a specific category, such as the Origin category, that category must appear under the feat's name. If you're instructed to choose a feat and no category is specified, you can choose from any category. #### Prerequisite To take a feat, you must meet any prerequisite in its description unless a feature allows you to take the feat without the prerequisite. If a prerequisite includes a class, you must have at least 1 level in that class to take the feat. #### Benefit The benefits of a feat are detailed after any prerequisites are listed. If you have a feat, you gain its benefits. #### Repeatable A feat can be taken only once unless its description states otherwise in a "Repeatable" subsection. ## Origin Feats These feats are in the Origin category. - [[alert-xphb (feats) - [Crafter Xphb]] - [[Healer Xphb - [Lucky Xphb]] - [[List Spells Feats Magic Initiate Xphb - [musician-xphb (feats)]] - [[savage-attacker-xphb (feats) - [skilled-xphb (feats)]] - [[tavern-brawler-xphb (feats) - [Tough Xphb]] ## General Feats These feats are in the General category. - [[Ability Score Improvement Xphb - [Actor Xphb]] - [[athlete-xphb (feats) - [charger-xphb (feats)]] - [[Chef Xphb - [crossbow-expert-xphb (feats)]] - [[Crusher Xphb - [defensive-duelist-xphb (feats)]] - [[dual-wielder-xphb (feats) - [Durable Xphb]] - [[Elemental Adept Xphb - [fey]] - [[Grappler Xphb - [great-weapon-master-xphb (feats)]] - [[heavily-armored-xphb (feats) - [heavy-armor-master-xphb (feats)]] - [[inspiring-leader-xphb (feats) - [keen-mind-xphb (feats)]] - [[lightly-armored-xphb (feats) - [mage-slayer-xphb (feats)]] - [[Martial Weapon Training Xphb - [Medium Armor Master Xphb]] - [[moderately-armored-xphb (feats) - [mounted-combatant-xphb (feats)]] - [[observant-xphb (feats) - [Piercer Xphb]] - [[Poisoner Xphb - [Polearm Master Xphb]] - [[resilient-xphb (feats) - [ritual-caster-xphb (feats)]] - [[Sentinel Xphb - [list-spells-feats-shadow-touched-xphb (lists)]] - [[sharpshooter-xphb (feats) - [Shield]] - [[skill-expert-xphb (feats) - [Skulker Xphb]] - [[slasher-xphb (feats) - [Speedy Xphb]] - [[Spell Sniper Xphb - [List Spells Feats Telekinetic Xphb]] - [[List Spells Feats Telepathic Xphb - [War Caster Xphb]] - [[great-weapon-master-xphb (feats) ## Fighting Style Feats These feats are in the Fighting Style category. - [Archery Xphb]] - [[Blind Fighting Xphb - [Defense Xphb]] - [[dueling-xphb (feats) - [Great Weapon Fighting Xphb]] - [[interception-xphb (feats) - [Protection Xphb]] - [[thrown-weapon-fighting-xphb (feats) - [two-weapon-fighting-xphb (feats)]] - [[unarmed-fighting-xphb (feats) ## Epic Boon Feats These feats are in the Epic Boon category. - [boon-of-combat-prowess-xphb (feats)]] - [[boon-of-dimensional-travel-xphb (feats) - [boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats)]] - [[boon-of-fate-xphb (feats) - [Boon of Fortitude Xphb]] - [[boon-of-irresistible-offense-xphb (feats) - [Boon of Recovery Xphb]] - [[boon-of-skill-xphb (feats) - [Boon of Speed Xphb]] - [[boon-of-spell-recall-xphb (feats) - [boon-of-the-night-spirit-xphb (feats)]] - [[boon-of-truesight-xphb (feats)]] ## Player-Facing Summary 06 chapter 5 feats is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of 06 chapter 5 feats as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around 06 chapter 5 feats. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
