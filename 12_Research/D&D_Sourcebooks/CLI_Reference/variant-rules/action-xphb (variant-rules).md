*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 360. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* On your turn, you can take one action.

These actions are defined elsewhere in this glossary: - [[actions#Attack|Attack]] - [[actions#Dodge|Dodge]] - [[actions#Dash|Dash]] - [[actions#Help|Help]] - [[actions#Disengage|Disengage]] - [[actions#Hide|Hide]] - [[actions#Influence|Influence]] - [[actions#Magic|Magic]] - [[actions#Ready|Ready]] - [[actions#Search|Search]] - [[actions#Study|Study]] - [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Action xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of action xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around action xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Alliance - Manipulate succession ## Plot Hooks - A merchant needs help delivering before the festival
