# Session 1: Strange Tides Rising
*The Seven Shards Campaign - Act I*

## Session Overview

The heroes witness the first signs of the Deep Mother's awakening when tidal patterns across Aquabyssos begin behaving erratically. Memory gaps plague citizens, crystalline growths appear in the depths, and shadow-touched creatures emerge from trenches that should be empty. This session establishes the campaign's tone and introduces the first hints of the greater mystery.

**Location**: [[Port Meridian]], Aquabyssos  
**Level**: 5th  
**Duration**: 4-6 hours  
**Key Theme**: Something ancient stirs beneath

## Opening: The Festival of Depths

The heroes arrive in [[Port Meridian]] during the annual Festival of Depths, celebrating Aquabyssos's connection to the ocean's mysteries. However, this year's celebration is marred by strange occurrences:

### The Interrupted Ceremony

**Scene Setup**: The festival's main ceremony involves the [[Tidal Crown]] - a ceremonial artifact that typically glows with gentle blue light during the blessing. This year, it flickers erratically and emits an unsettling harmonic resonance.

**Key NPCs**:
- **[[High Priestess Coral Depthsinger]]**: Officiating the ceremony, visibly disturbed by the crown's behavior
- **[[Harbor Master Nautilus Tideguard]]**: Reporting unusual tidal patterns to city officials
- **[[Merchant Princess Seren Goldwave]]**: [[Lord Aurelius Goldwave]]'s daughter, displaying early signs of crystal corruption

**Read Aloud**:
> The great plaza of Port Meridian thrums with celebration as thousands gather for the Festival of Depths. Bioluminescent decorations cast dancing patterns of blue and green light across the coral architecture. At the ceremony's heart, High Priestess Coral Depthsinger raises the ancient Tidal Crown - but instead of its customary serene glow, the artifact pulses with an almost frantic rhythm. The crowd murmurs uneasily as an otherworldly harmonic resonance fills the water, causing sensitive sea life to flee the area.

### Investigation Opportunities

**Priestess's Concerns (DC 15 Insight)**:
- The Tidal Crown has never behaved this way
- Ancient texts speak of "the Deep Mother's call"
- Similar artifacts worldwide have shown unusual activity

**Harbor Master's Reports (DC 12 Investigation)**:
- Tidal patterns don't match any known astronomical influences
- Deep-sea creatures are migrating to unusual depths
- Three fishing boats reported "shadows in the abyss"

**Merchant Activity (DC 18 Perception)**:
- [[Merchant Princess Seren Goldwave]] has small crystalline growths on her left temple
- She seems unaware of them, deflecting questions about her health
- Her trading company has recently acquired exclusive rights to certain deep-sea mining operations

## Main Event: The Memory Thieves

As the festival continues, several citizens begin experiencing memory gaps mid-conversation. The heroes witness a [[Memory Merchant]] - one of [[Vex Shadowthorn]]'s shadow-touched agents - extracting memories from festival-goers.

### The Theft in Progress

**Scene Setup**: A hooded figure moves through the crowd, touching people briefly. Each touch leaves the victim momentarily confused, having lost specific memories related to recent unusual events.

**Combat Encounter**: Memory Merchant and 3 Shadow Wisps
- **Memory Merchant**: Use **Enchanter** stats (VGtM) with added memory manipulation
- **Shadow Wisps**: Incorporeal creatures that feed on forgotten memories
- **Terrain**: Crowded festival with innocent bystanders requiring careful combat

**Special Mechanics**:
- **Memory Drain**: Touched creatures lose one significant memory from the past week
- **Shadow Corruption**: Extended exposure causes temporary shadow-touch (disadvantage on Charisma saves)
- **Bystander Chaos**: Combat in crowd requires Dexterity saves to avoid collateral damage

### Investigation Results

**Memory Merchant's Equipment**:
- **[[Memory Crystal]]**: Contains dozens of stolen memories about strange tides, unusual dreams, and deep-sea anomalies
- **[[Shadow-Touched Surgical Tools]]**: Evidence of [[The Shadow Conspiracy]]'s involvement
- **[[Encrypted Orders]]**: Written in [[Shadow Script]], mentioning "convergence preparations"

**Recovered Memories** (if crystal is used):
- Visions of massive crystalline structures growing in ocean trenches
- Dreams of a vast consciousness calling from the depths
- Reports of reality distortions near dimensional barriers

## Rising Action: The Depth Expedition

Following the memory theft investigation, the heroes learn of an expedition to the [[Mariana Depths]] that departed three days ago and hasn't reported back. The expedition was investigating "geological anomalies" but may have discovered something far more dangerous.

### The Missing Expedition

**Key Information**:
- Led by [[Dr. Marina Voidseeker]], specialist in deep-ocean phenomena
- Funded by the [[Silverscale Consortium]] through shell companies
- Last transmission mentioned "crystalline formations of impossible size"
- Expedition team includes [[The Nameless Warden]]'s scout probes

### Journey to the Depths

**Travel Challenges**:
- **Pressure Adaptation**: Constitution saves or suffer depth-related exhaustion
- **Navigation Hazards**: Strange currents attempt to lead the party astray (DC 16 Survival)
- **Creature Encounters**: Shadow-touched deep-sea life, more aggressive than normal

**Environmental Features**:
- **Tidal Anomalies**: Unpredictable currents that can separate the party
- **Bioluminescent Displays**: Beautiful but potentially hypnotic patterns
- **Pressure Whispers**: Subtle psychic influence from the awakening [[Consciousness Shard]]

### The Discovery Site

**Read Aloud**:
> The expedition's final coordinates lead you to a sight that defies comprehension. Rising from the abyssal plain, massive crystalline spires pierce the ocean floor like the ribs of some titanic beast. Each crystal pulse with internal light that seems almost... aware. The water here feels thick, charged with an energy that makes your skin tingle and your mind itch with half-formed thoughts that aren't your own.

**The Expedition's Fate**:
- **[[Dr. Marina Voidseeker]]**: Found alive but partially consciousness-corrupted
- **Scout Team**: Two members completely taken over by shadow-touch
- **Equipment**: Damaged but containing crucial recordings of the shard's influence

## Climax: The Consciousness Echo

The crystalline formations are growing around a fragment of the [[Consciousness Shard]], and its influence is spreading. The heroes must decide how to handle their first direct encounter with shard power.

### The Shard Chamber

**Location Features**:
- **Memory Echoes**: Psychic imprints of the Deep Mother's thoughts
- **Crystalline Growth**: Rapidly expanding formations that could trap the party
- **Consciousness Pressure**: Mental saves required to maintain individual identity

**Boss Encounter**: Consciousness Echo
- **Stats**: Use **Mind Flayer** baseline with crystal-based attacks
- **Special Abilities**:
  - **Memory Steal**: Target loses a skill proficiency for 24 hours
  - **Consciousness Split**: Create shadowy duplicate of party member
  - **Shard Resonance**: All psychic damage increased in the area

### Resolution Options

**Destroy the Growth**: 
- Requires significant force, risks underground collapse
- Eliminates immediate threat but may alert other shards
- **Dr. Marina Voidseeker** provides technical assistance

**Contain the Growth**:
- Requires magical expertise and rare materials
- Maintains status quo but growth continues slowly
- Provides ongoing research opportunity

**Study and Monitor**:
- Allows heroes to learn about shard mechanics
- Risks further corruption spread
- Establishes long-term story hooks

## Conclusion: The First Revelation

Based on their choices and discoveries, the heroes realize they've encountered something far beyond a local threat. [[Dr. Marina Voidseeker]] shares what she's learned about ancient texts mentioning seven fragments of a primordial entity.

**For Higher Levels (6th-7th)**:
- Add additional Memory Merchants
- Include more complex trap mechanics in the shard chamber
- Introduce competing expedition teams

### Connection Points

**Links to Previous Adventures**:
- References to [[Winds of Rebellion]] NPC connections
