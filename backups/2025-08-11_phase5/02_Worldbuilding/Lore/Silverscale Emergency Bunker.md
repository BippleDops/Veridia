# Silverscale Emergency Bunker

*"When the surface world burns, the scales provide sanctuary below."*

## Overview
The Silverscale Emergency Bunker is a heavily fortified underground facility designed to protect key personnel and resources during catastrophic events affecting Aethermoor. Built by the Silverscale organization using both surface and underwater engineering techniques, it represents one of the most secure locations in the surface realm. The bunker features advanced life support systems, magical shielding, and secure communication networks linking it to both realms.

## Historical Background
Constructed during a period of increasing inter-realm tensions, the bunker was designed to serve as a command center and refuge for Silverscale leadership during crises. Its creation required unprecedented cooperation between surface architects and underwater pressure-engineering specialists.

## Current State
The bunker remains on standby alert, fully stocked and ready for immediate occupation. Recent dimensional instabilities have triggered several false alarms, leading to reviews of activation protocols.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
- Silverscale authorization codes
- Emergency condition declaration
- Biometric verification
- Crisis-level threat assessment

### Effects
- **Complete Protection**: Immunity to most surface-world catastrophes
- **Command Capabilities**: Maintain leadership during crises
- **Resource Security**: Preserve essential supplies and personnel
- **Communication Hub**: Coordinate response across both realms

### Duration
Designed for sustained operation up to one year without external support.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Bunker Infiltration**: Characters must gain access during an emergency
2. **False Alarm**: Investigate what triggered unauthorized activation
3. **Siege Scenario**: Protect or attack the bunker during a crisis

## Campaign Use
Provides secure meeting location, refuge during disasters, or target for infiltration missions.
