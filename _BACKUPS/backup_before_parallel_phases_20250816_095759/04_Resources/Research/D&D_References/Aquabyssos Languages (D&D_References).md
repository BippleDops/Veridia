Comprehensive linguistic system covering the rich variety of speech patterns, dialects, and communication methods across both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor, including practical table-ready rules for language-based encounters and social interactions. ### Language Proficiency System

**Basic Proficiency** (Understands simple concepts)

- Can adapt speech patterns to different social contexts
- **DC 12** for specialized terminology **Master Proficiency** (Native-level mastery)
- Recognizes specific regional variations and social markers
- Can employ professional jargon and code words
- **DC 10** for even highly technical discussions ### Environmental Modifiers

**Pressure/Altitude Effects**
- Surface level: No modifiers
- Mid-depth/altitude: +2 DC for non-adapted speakers
- Deep/high altitude: +5 DC for non-adapted speakers
- Extreme depths/heights: Disadvantage on all language checks **Atmospheric Conditions**
- Calm conditions: No modifiers
- Moderate weather/currents: +2 DC
- Severe conditions: +5 DC or disadvantage
- Crisis conditions: May require alternative communication ### Social Context Modifiers

**Formal Settings**: +3 DC for improper register or dialect
**Criminal/Underground**: +5 DC without appropriate cant knowledge
**Professional Guilds**: +5 DC without specialized terminology
**Cross-Realm Communication**: +3 DC due to cultural differences
**Mixed Heritage Communities**: -2 DC due to linguistic flexibility ### Example A: Depth Negotiation

**Situation**: Party needs information from deep-adapted merchant
**Language Challenge**: Merchant speaks only Deep Abyssal with heavy pressure cant
**Success (**DC 13**)**: Understands pricing terms and location details; gains merchant's respect
**Failure**: Misunderstands cultural context; offends merchant, prices increase 50%
**Fail-Forward**: Merchant's child translates but now knows party's business ### Example B: Cross-Realm Diplomacy

**Situation**: Negotiating trade agreement between realms
**Language Challenge**: Must navigate both wind song protocols and depth courtesy
**Success (**DC 15**)**: Properly honors both cultural forms; agreement proceeds smoothly
**Failure**: Cultural insult delays negotiations; reputation damaged with one faction
**Fail-Forward**: Interpreter steps in but now has leverage over party ### Example C: Criminal Cant Investigation

**Situation**: Infiltrating shadow conspiracy meeting
**Language Challenge**: Must use proper shadow cant and criminal terminology
**Success (**DC 18**)**: Gains access to sensitive information; maintains cover
**Failure**: Recognized as outsider; must flee or fight, mission potentially compromised
**Fail-Forward**: Accepted as new recruit but assigned dangerous initiation task ## Player-Facing Summary The linguistic diversity of Aquabyssos and Aethermoor reflects the environmental and cultural pressures that shape each realm. Characters who invest in language skills gain significant advantages in social encounters, professional advancement, and cross-realm diplomacy. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - An heirloom has gone missing and chaos spreads
