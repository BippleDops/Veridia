## Description
The tabaxi (called cat-people or tigerfolk by some) are a reclusive race of feline humanoids that dwell far from settled areas, making their homes deep in remote forests and jungles. They rarely engage in trade or dealings with other races, preferring to keep to themselves most of the time.

Tabaxis are catlike and very graceful in their movements. They resemble humanoids with feline characteristics akin to tigers. Their hands and feet sport vicious claws that can inflict significant damage.

Although tabaxis have little use for clothing or most other material possessions, they have a great fascination for and aptitude with weapons. A tabaxi can pick up almost any weapon and immediately use it with great skill.

Tabaxis are also skilled at fighting with their claws. They specialize in a one-two attack that involves striking with both claws and then raking the target with the claws of one foot.

Tabaxis live in small groups called prides. A typical pride consists of one to three each of adult males, adult females, and young. Females tend to be slightly larger than males and usually are the dominant members of a pride. Tabaxis live a nomadic lifestyle, prowling through their chosen range and hunting in groups of three to five. They carry little in the way of possessions, other than the small armory of weapons they’ve captured from enemies and intruders. Unless they are desperately hungry, most tabaxi prides leave other intelligent creatures alone. They might attack, however, if intruders are carrying especially interesting-looking weaponry.
