## Overview
Nereon Swiftcurrent, known throughout Aquabyssos simply as "The Current Merchants" due to his mastery over oceanic trade routes, is the most successful merchant in the underwater realm's history. His Deep Current Trading Company has revolutionized commerce by utilizing magical manipulation of ocean currents to create impossibly fast and efficient shipping networks that connect the farthest reaches of the aquatic world.

More than just a businessman, Nereon has become a fundamental force in Aquabyssos's economy and politics. His ability to predict and control current patterns has made him indispensable to everyone from small fishing villages to the imperial government. He represents the new generation of aquatic entrepreneurs who view the ocean not as a barrier but as an infinite highway of opportunity.

Nereon's influence extends far beyond mere trade. His current-riding ships serve as communication networks, his traders double as intelligence agents, and his ability to redirect the flow of goods gives him the power to make or break entire regions. He has transformed from a simple merchant into a maritime emperor whose decisions shape the economic destiny of the underwater realm.

## Appearance
Nereon is a tall, elegant sea elf standing 6'2" with the lean, streamlined build typical of his people. His skin has taken on a subtle blue-green tint from decades of current-magic exposure, and it occasionally shows faint patterns reminiscent of flowing water. His hair is silver-white and moves constantly as if underwater even when in air-filled environments, a side effect of his deep connection to oceanic currents.

His most striking feature is his eyes, which shift between deep blue and bright silver depending on his emotional state and the strength of nearby currents. When he's actively using his current-sight abilities, his pupils become swirling vortexes that mirror the flow patterns he's observing. His ears are elongated and mobile, helping him sense changes in water pressure and current direction.

Nereon dresses in flowing robes made from specially treated kelp-silk that responds to his magical presence, creating the illusion that he's constantly surrounded by gentle currents. His jewelry consists of living coral pieces that serve as both status symbols and magical focuses, connected to different current networks throughout the realm. He carries a staff made from crystallized water that serves as both a walking aid and a powerful tool for current manipulation.

## Personality
Nereon embodies the restless, ever-changing nature of the currents themselves. He is charismatic and charming when conducting business, but can shift to cold calculation when necessary. His mind works in patterns and flows, always seeking the most efficient route to his goals while maintaining multiple backup plans.

He possesses an entrepreneur's optimism combined with a navigator's caution, always willing to take calculated risks but never betting everything on a single venture. Nereon genuinely believes that trade and commerce are forces for good, bringing different communities together and raising the standard of living for everyone involved.

His greatest flaw is his tendency to see everything in terms of profit and loss, sometimes missing the human cost of his business decisions. However, he has begun to mature beyond pure mercantilism, recognizing that long-term success requires consideration of environmental and social impacts.

### The Current Apprentice (78-50 years ago)
Born to a family of traditional kelp farmers in the outer reaches of Aquabyssos, Nereon showed early signs of current-sensitivityâ€”the ability to sense and predict changes in water flow patterns. Rather than following his family into agriculture, he apprenticed himself to an elderly sea elf navigator named Master Torrent who taught him the ancient arts of current-reading and water-path navigation.

During his apprenticeship, Nereon revolutionized traditional navigation by combining magical current-sight with mathematical modeling and detailed record-keeping. He created the first comprehensive maps of the deep ocean current systems and developed prediction methods that allowed for journey times to be calculated with unprecedented accuracy.

### The Trading Innovator (50-30 years ago)
Nereon's breakthrough came when he realized that currents could be magically influenced as well as predicted. Working with a team of sorcerers and druids, he developed techniques for temporarily redirecting current flows to create more efficient shipping routes. His first major success was reducing the travel time between the capital and the outer settlements from two weeks to five days.

He founded the Deep Current Trading Company with a small fleet of specially designed ships that could surf the magical currents he created. His revolutionary approach to maritime commerce allowed him to undercut traditional shipping methods while providing faster and more reliable service. Within a decade, he had captured 40% of all trade moving through Aquabyssos waters.

### The Maritime Emperor (30-10 years ago)
As his company grew, Nereon expanded beyond simple shipping to become a comprehensive trading empire. He established permanent trading posts at crucial current intersections, created standardized currency exchange systems, and developed insurance programs that protected merchants from the risks of deep-sea commerce.

His most ambitious project during this period was the Grand Current Circuitâ€”a magically enhanced shipping route that connected all major population centers in Aquabyssos in a continuous loop. This innovation effectively unified the realm's economy and made him the most powerful non-government figure in underwater society.

### The Current Crisis (10 years ago to present)
Recent years have brought new challenges as Nereon's success has attracted both competitors and critics. Environmental groups argue that his current manipulation is disrupting natural ecosystems, political rivals claim his economic power threatens governmental authority, and criminal organizations target his shipping networks for piracy and smuggling operations.

Nereon has responded by diversifying his interests beyond pure commerce, investing in research, education, and infrastructure projects that benefit the entire realm. He has also begun training successors who can maintain his trading empire while he transitions to a more advisory role focused on long-term economic planning and oceanic environmental protection.

### Current Mastery
Nereon's deep connection to oceanic currents grants him extraordinary abilities:
- **Current Sight**: Can perceive the flow of all water within a 50-mile radius, including speed, direction, and magical influences
- **Flow Manipulation**: Can redirect currents to create efficient travel routes or defensive barriers
- **Pressure Sense**: Detects changes in water pressure that indicate weather patterns, seismic activity, or large creature movement
- **Current Riding**: Can travel at incredible speeds by surfing natural or artificial current flows
- **Temporal Flow**: Limited ability to accelerate or slow the passage of time in small areas by manipulating temporal currents

### The Deep Current Trading Company
Nereon's commercial empire includes:
- **Main Fleet**: 200 current-riding vessels of various sizes and specializations
- **Trading Posts**: 47 permanent installations at key current intersections and population centers
- **Warehouse Networks**: Secure storage facilities in every major city and many smaller settlements
- **Employee Base**: Over 3,000 sailors, traders, administrators, and support staff
- **Subsidiary Companies**: Smaller specialized firms handling insurance, banking, and specialized cargo

4. **Personal**: Prove that individual initiative and innovation can accomplish more than traditional institutions
5. **Ultimate**: Unite all oceanic civilizations through a comprehensive network of trade, communication, and mutual prosperity

## Combat Tactics
Nereon prefers to avoid direct confrontation, but when forced to fight:
- Uses current manipulation to control battlefield conditions and limit enemy movement
- Employs storm magic to create environmental hazards that favor his aquatic allies
- Relies on superior mobility to stay out of range while supporting allies with enhancement magic
- Calls upon his extensive network of employees and partners for reinforcement
- Uses teleportation through current networks to retreat when outmatched
- If cornered, can create devastating whirlpools and electrical storms

## Adventure Hooks

## Speaking Style
*"The currents never lie, friend. They'll tell you everything you need to know about where you've been, where you're going, and what you'll find when you get there."*

*"Business is like navigationâ€”you need to know where the deep waters are, how to read the signs, and when to adjust your course. Rush toward profit too quickly and you'll founder on the reefs of poor planning."*

*"Every current connects to every other current eventually. That's the secret of successful tradeâ€”understanding that no market exists in isolation."*

*"I've made my fortune by going with the flow, but that doesn't mean being passive. Sometimes you have to create the current that carries everyone forward."*

*(When negotiating)* "Now, I could charge you the standard rate, but I see an opportunity here for both of us. What if we structured this as a partnership instead of a simple transaction?"*
