## Overview
A haunted legislative chamber beneath the current Parliament building where the spirits of Aquabyssos's first democratic representatives continue their debates. This forgotten room was sealed after a catastrophic political scandal, but the supernatural echoes of ancient political arguments still resonate.

The chamber exists in a state of temporal suspension, where ghostly parliamentarians endlessly re-enact their final, fateful session.

## History
Two centuries ago, before the current monarchy, Aquabyssos was governed by a democratically elected Parliament. A massive corruption scandal involving foreign influence and criminal cartels led to the government's collapse and the chamber's abandonment.

The traumatic end to democracy left such a psychic impression that the spirits of the parliamentarians remain trapped, forever debating the crisis that destroyed their system.

## The Spectral Session
**Ongoing Debate**: The spirits endlessly argue about their final legislation
**Key Figures**: Ghostly Speaker, opposition leaders, and reform advocates
**Supernatural Effects**: Temporal echoes replay historical moments
**Communication**: Spirits can interact with living visitors under certain conditions
**Resolution**: The debate cannot end until historical justice is achieved

## Notable Spirits
**Speaker Cornelius Deepwater**: Still trying to maintain order
**Representative Sarah Justice**: Reform advocate who exposed the corruption
**Lord Marcus Goldcurrent**: Corrupt official whose crimes destroyed democracy
**The Foreign Agent**: Mysterious figure who orchestrated the scandal
**Common Citizens**: Gallery ghosts who died defending democracy

## Accessing the Chamber
**Official Routes**: Require highest security clearance
**Secret Passages**: Hidden entrances through palace basements
**Supernatural Methods**: Some spirits can guide living visitors
**Emergency Access**: Maintece tunnels during certain conditions
**Restricted Times**: Chamber is most active during significant political events

## The Unresolved Crisis
The spirits cannot rest until their final legislation is properly addressed:
- Anti-corruption measures that were never implemented
- Foreign influence investigations left incomplete
- Democratic reforms that died with the government
- Justice for those who died defending the parliament
- Acknowledgment of the truth about the government's fall

## Adventure Hooks
1. Characters discover chamber during palace infiltration
2. Spirits request help completing their unfinished business
3. Political crisis echoes historical patterns, drawing parallels
4. Ancient corruption evidence needed for current investigation

## Potential Resolutions
**Historical Justice**: Expose and address the original corruption
**Democratic Reform**: Restore some form of representative government
**Spiritual Peace**: Help spirits find closure and move on
**Political Upheaval**: Use evidence to challenge current authority
**Supernatural Containment**: Seal chamber permanently to prevent problems

### Key Locations
1. Main entrance/approach
2. Central gathering area
3. Important buildings/features
4. Defensive positions (if applicable)
5. Hidden or secret areas
