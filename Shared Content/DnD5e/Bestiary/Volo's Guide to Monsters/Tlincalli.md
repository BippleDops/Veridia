## Actions
Multiattack. The tlincalli makes two attacks: one with its longsword or spiked chain, and one with its sting.

Longsword. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d8+3`) slashing damage, or 8 (`dice: 1d10+3`) slashing damage if used with two hands.

Spiked Chain. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d6+3`) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 11) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tlincalli can't use the spiked chain against another target.

Sting. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d6+3`) piercing damage plus 14 (`dice: 4d6`) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. If it fails the saving throw by 5 or more, the target is also paralyzed while poisoned. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
