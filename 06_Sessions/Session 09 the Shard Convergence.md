Reality distortions plague both worlds as the shards resonate with increasing power. The heroes must race to find the final [[[[Unity Shard|[Unity Shard]]]] while preventing the others from merging and reforming the [[[[Deep Mother|[Deep Mother]]]]. **[[location|Location**: [[[Convergence Point]]|[[Convergence Point]], [[Order of the [[Azure Flame Sanctuary|[Order Of]] [[The Azure [Flame Sanctuary]]]], [[[[The Liminal Space|[The Liminal]] Space]] **Level**: 8th **Duration**: 5-7 hours **[[Key Theme**: The price of knowledge and the weight of choice```dataview TABLE location, guardian, threat-level, status FROM "02_Worldbuilding" WHERE contains(tags, "shard") AND contains(tags, "seven-shards") SORT threat-level DESC```## Opening: [Reality Fractures]] The session begins with reality itself showing strain. The barrier between [[Aquabyssos|Aquabyssos and [Aethermoor|Aethermoor]] develops visible cracks, allowing glimpses of the other world to bleed through. ### [[The Convergence Crisis **[Scene Setup]]**: The heroes witness a reality fracture event where sections of both worlds temporarily overlap, causing chaos and revealing the true scope of the crisis. > [!danger] [[Reality Fracture Event > The morning sky splits like broken glass, revealing the depths of Aquabyssos beyond. Sea water pours from the sky while air bubbles rise from the ocean floor. Citizens from both worlds can see each other across the dimensional divide, and some are pulled through the cracks. The very fabric of existence groans under the pressure of seven awakening cosmic artifacts. **Meta-[Bind Interactive]] Element**:```meta-bind-button

Here, the [[Unity Shard hovers in the center, its light neither the blue of Aquabyssos nor the white of Aethermoor, but something entirely new. Around it, echoes of past guardians stand vigil, including images of yourselves from possible futures where you succeeded or failed in your quest. **[The Guardian]] Trials**: Each hero faces a personal challenge representing their greatest fear about unity and cooperation: **[[Possible Challenges**:
- Losing individual identity in a group consciousness
- Being responsible for others' choices and failures
- Trusting others with ultimate power
- Accepting that some conflicts have no perfect resolution ### Encounter: [The Convergence]] [[Avatars As the heroes attempt to claim the [[[Unity Shard]]|[[Unity Shard]], manifestations of the other six shards appear to test their worthiness. **[[Initiative Tracker Setup**:```initiative-tracker - name: [Consciousness Avatar]] hp: 120 ac: 17 initiative: 15

[[Complete Separation **Requirements**: Destroy the [[[Unity Shard]]|[[Unity Shard]], scatter others permanently **Outcome**: Worlds permanently separated, no more reality bleed **Cost**: Loss of all cross-world connections, some NPCs die #### 2. [[Controlled Unity **Requirements**: Maintain all seven shards in perfect balance **Outcome**: Worlds remain separate but with stable connections **Cost**: Constant vigilance, gradual corruption risk #### 3. [True Merger]] **Requirements**: Use [[[[Unity Shard|[Unity Shard]]]] to permanently combine worlds **Outcome**: Single realm with merged cultures and magic **Cost**: Initial chaos, loss of unique cultural identities #### 4. [[Deep Mother's Return **Requirements**: Allow the shards to reform the original entity **Outcome**: Ancient consciousness guides both worlds **Cost**: Free will partially surrendered to benevolent oversight ### [The Ritual]] Mechanics **[[Skill Challenge**: The ritual requires multiple successful skill checks from all heroes: - ****DC 18** Arcana**: Manipulate shard energies safely
- ****DC 16** Insight**: Understand the true desires of both worlds
- ****DC 20** Religion**: Invoke proper spiritual protections
- ****DC 15** Persuasion**: Convince NPCs to support the chosen path **[Failure Consequences]]**:
- 0 successes: Catastrophic reality collapse
- 1-2 successes: Partial merger with ongoing instability
- 3-4 successes: Chosen outcome with minor complications
- 5+ successes: Perfect implementation of chosen path label: [[Perform Convergence]] Ritual id: convergence-ritual
args: ["`dice: `dice: 6d20``"] ## Resolution: [[New Horizons Based on the heroes' choices and the ritual's success, the session concludes with the immediate aftermath of their decision and setup for the final session. ### [Immediate Consequences]] **[[For Each Path**: - **Separation**: Tearful goodbyes, establishment of new borders
