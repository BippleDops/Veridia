## Overview
The Crimson Sage appears as a mysterious scholar researching crystal corruption and ancient history. In truth, they are Aetheron, the shattered God-King whose crown became the Aether Crystals. Stripped of most divine power and trapped in mortal form, they seek to understand what they have become and perhaps find redemptionâ€”or revenge.

## The Truth
> [!warning] Ultimate Secret - DM Only
> The Crimson Sage is Aetheron, the God-King whose crown shattered 500 years ago. When the Seven Advisors betrayed him, the shattering scattered his essence across the crystals. He reformed as this diminished mortal form, retaining knowledge but not omnipotence. He both created and is victim of the crystal corruption.

## Secrets Within Secrets

> 2. **Level 2**: Immortal being with knowledge of the Shattering
> 3. **Level 3**: Is actually Aetheron, the shattered god
> 4. **Level 4**: Orchestrating events to reclaim godhood
> 5. **Level 5**: Genuinely uncertain if godhood should be reclaimed
> 6. **Level 6**: The corruption might be his subconsious attempt at reunion with creation

*"The crown was not broken. It was... distributed. The question is whether it should be gathered again."*

*"I have walked this world for five centuries, and still mortality surprises me."*

*(When revealing partial truth) "I was there when the crown shattered. I saw the sky weep crystals."*

## Boons He Might Grant

### From God-King to Mortal
The transformation from Aetheron the God-King to the Crimson Sage was neither instant nor complete. It occurred over decades as his shattered essence slowly coalesced into this diminished form.

### The Original Conspiracy
The seven advisors who shattered Aetheron's crown were not acting from pure malice, but from genuine belief that his godhood had become corrupted and dangerous.

### The Betrayers' Names and Fates
1. **Marcus the Just** - Ancestor of [[High Inquisitor Maltheos]]
2. **Seraphina the Wise** - Founded the first crystal healing academy
3. **Gareth Ironheart** - Military commander who died in the Shattering
4. **Lysander the Scholar** - Created the first crystal research protocols
5. **Nerissa Tidecaller** - Ancestor of several current noble families
6. **Valdris the Merchant** - Ancestor of [[Lord Aurelius Goldwave]]
7. **Thrace the Builder** - Architect of the original crystal containment systems

### Multiple Concurrent Agendas
The Sage operates several overlapping schemes simultaneously, some contradicting others as he remains genuinely uncertain about his ultimate goals.

### The Weight of Omniscience
Having once known everything within his domain, the Sage now struggles with uncertainty and the need to learn through observation and deduction.

## Adventure Seed Generator
Roll d12 for type of interaction:

1-3: **Information Broker** - Provides crucial historical or prophetic knowledge
4-6: **Test Giver** - Presents moral dilemma or challenge to judge party
7-9: **Manipulator** - Subtly guides party toward his current agenda
10-11: **Benefactor** - Offers magical aid or divine blessing
12: **Opponent** - Party goals conflict with his plans, leading to confrontation

### His Role as Cosmic Weaver
The Crimson Sage doesn't merely observe events - he actively weaves them into patterns that serve his mysterious agenda. Every encounter, every quest hook, every revelation is part of a vast tapestry he's been constructing for five centuries.

### The Threads of Destiny
**Individual Threads:** Each person's life forms a thread in his grand design
**Event Nodes:** Critical moments where multiple threads intersect and futures diverge
**Pattern Recognition:** His divine nature allows him to see how current actions will ripple through time
**Course Correction:** Subtle interventions to guide events toward his desired outcomes
**The Great Convergence:** All threads are moving toward a single, climactic moment

### The Ultimate Truth About the Shattering
The Seven Advisors didn't betray Aetheron - they saved the world from him. His divine consciousness had been corrupted by an entity from beyond the material plane, and the crown's shattering was the only way to break that influence. The Crimson Sage is slowly remembering this truth and must decide whether to reclaim godhood or accept that his advisors were heroes.

### The Real Purpose of Crystal Corruption
The corruption isn't a side effect of the Shattering - it's Aetheron's divine essence trying to reunite with living beings. Every corrupted individual carries a fragment of his consciousness, and curing them means destroying part of his own soul. This is why no permanent cure has been found - it would require the Sage to sacrifice his immortality and memories.

### The Coming Choice
The campaign will eventually force the Sage to choose between four ultimate fates:
1. **Restoration:** Reclaim godhood but risk corruption returning
2. **Sacrifice:** Destroy himself to end corruption forever
3. **Evolution:** Transform into something new and unprecedented
4. **Acceptance:** Remain as guide and protector in diminished form

This choice will determine not just his fate, but the future of magic, monarchy, and mortality itself.
