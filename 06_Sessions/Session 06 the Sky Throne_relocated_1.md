- -- # Session 6: [The Sky]] Throne * Level 6-7 Characters | 4-5 Hours | [[Court Intrigue/Investigation/[Political Maneuvering]]* ## 🔧 [[Deep Evaluation Improvements * 20 targeted improvements identified* ### [Connection Improvements]] - Add cross-references to related notes ### [[Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## [Session Overview]] The party travels to Aethermoor for the first time, entering the floating crystal city of [[[Luminspire|Luminspire|Luminspire]] to investigate the [[Fifth Shard's location and [The Collector]]'s influence at [[Queen Seraphina's court. They must navigate Aethermoor's wind-based culture, crystal-enhanced politics, and the growing madness that seems to be affecting the realm's leadership. This session focuses heavily on social encounters, court intrigue, and the discovery that the corruption affecting both realms might be connected. ### [The Wind]] [[Gate Crossing The party experiences their first journey between realms through the **[Wind Gate]]**, a massive portal maintained by wind-riders and current-shapers working in harmony. ### [[Read Aloud * The sensation of crossing between realms is indescribable - one moment you're surrounded by the pressure and flow of deep water, and the next you're breathing thin, crystal-clear air as wind currents lift you impossibly high above an ocean of clouds.* * Before you stretches [Luminspire|Luminspire]], the crown jewel of Aethermoor. Crystalline spires twist upward like frozen tornadoes, connected by bridges of hardened wind and gossamer-thin platforms that shouldn't be able to support their own weight. The entire city pulses with a soft, prismatic light that seems to respond to the movements of its inhabitants.* ### [[Cultural Adjustment Characters must adapt to Aethermoor's unique environment: **[Environmental Challenges]]**:
- **Altitude**: Constitution saves (**DC 12**) for the first hour or gain exhaustion
- **[[Wind Currents**: Movement requires understanding flow patterns (Athletics or Acrobatics checks for complex navigation)
- **[Crystal Resoce]]**: The city's crystals respond to emotions and magical energy, creating privacy challenges **[[Cultural Differences**:
- **[Vertical Social]] Structure**: Status is literally determined by how high in the city you're allowed to live
- **Wind-Speech**: Important conversations happen while gliding on air currents
- **[[Crystal Memory**: The city itself remembers conversations and events, making secrets difficult to keep ### [The Ascending]] [[Court The party must present themselves to **[[[Queen Seraphina]] Lumengarde|[[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]** in the **[[Crystal Throne Room**, located at the city's highest point. **[[[Chamberlain Aurelius]] Windspeak|[[Chamberlain Aurelius Windspeak]]** - The court official who manages access to the Queen, clearly nervous about something. **[[Master of [[Crystals Prism Multifacet|[Master Of]] [[Crystals Prism Multifacet]]** - Chief advisor on crystal technology, showing signs of the same corruption affecting the Queen. Additionally, **[[[[Wind Marshal [Gale Stormwright]]|[[Wind Marshal [Gale Stormwright]]]]** - Military commander, one of the few court members still unaffected by crystal corruption. ### [[The Corruption [Revealed When]] the party meets [[Queen Seraphina, they see the effects of long-term crystal exposure: ### [Read Aloud]] * [[Queen Seraphina sits upon a throne carved from a single massive crystal that seems to pulse with its own heartbeat. Once, she must have been beautiful, but now crystal formations sprout from her skin like living jewelry. Her eyes have become faceted gems that reflect not just light, but fragments of time and possibility.* * When she speaks, her voice has a crystalline chime that's both beautiful and unsettling. "Welcome, travelers from the depths. We have... Seen your arrival. The crystals show us many things. Too many things."* ### [Court Politics]] [[Skill Challenge **Goal**: Gain the Queen's trust and access to court resources **Complexity**: 6 successes before 3 failures **[Skill Options]]**:
- **Persuasion **DC 16****: Appeal to the Queen's remaining rational mind
- **Insight **DC 14****: Understand which personality fragment is speaking
- **History **DC 18****: Reference shared heritage between realms
- **Medicine **DC 20****: Recognize the crystal corruption symptoms
- **[[Arcana|Arcana **DC 15****: Understand the magical nature of her condition **[Success Results]]**:
- Access to the [[Royal Library and [Crystal Archives]]
- [[Introduction|Introduction to potential allies in court
- Warning about [The Collector]]'s influence
- Permission to investigate freely in the city **[[Failure Results**:
- Restricted access to court resources
- Surveillance by crystal-enhanced guards
- Some court members turn hostile
- Must find alternative information sources ### [The Crystal]] [[Archives If the party gains access, they discover crucial information in the **[Crystal Memory]] Vaults**: **[[[[Archivist Spectrum Memorykeeper|[Archivist Spectrum]] Memorykeeper]]** - An elderly crystal-touched scholar who has been documenting the Queen's decline. **[[Key Discoveries**: - **[The Fifth]] Shard's History**: Once used to stabilize Aethermoor's floating cities, now hidden for safety
- **[[The Collector's Identity**: [[[Lord Aurelius]] Voidcrown|[[Lord Aurelius Voidcrown]] is revealed to be the Queen's own cousin, presumed dead in an expedition years ago
- **[[Crystal Corruption Pattern**: The corruption affects those with the strongest magical connections first
- **[The Connection]]**: The crystal corruption and [[Aquabyssos|Aquabyssos's memory thefts follow similar patterns ### Reading the [Crystal Memories]] The party can directly interface with the crystal memory storage: **[[Experience Crystal Memory** (Wisdom save **DC 15**): - **Success**: Gain vivid memories of key events, including [The Collector]]'s last known location
- **Failure**: Overwhelmed by sensory input, gain disadvantage on Intelligence and Wisdom checks for 24 hours **[[Memory Revelations**:
- Aurelius's "death" was faked after he discovered something in the deep archives
- He took several crystal shards and ancient texts when he fled
- His last message mentioned "joining the depths to the heights"
- References to preparing for "the great convergence" ### [Court Intrigue]]: [[The Wind Riders' [Conspiracy The]] party discovers that some of the Queen's closest advisors are working with [[The Collector: **[[[Captain Zephyr]] Voidwing|[[Captain Zephyr Voidwing]]** - Leader of the Queen's personal guard, secretly reporting to [[The Collector. **[[[Trade Minister]] [[Gale Goldwind|[Trade Minister]] [[Gale Goldwind]]** - Managing resources being smuggled to support [[The Collector's operations. **[[[Court Mage]] [[Tempest Shadowcryst|[Court Mage]] [[Tempest Shadowcryst]]** - Using court position to research shard locations and vulnerabilities. ### [[Infiltration Challenges **Option 1: [Direct Confrontation]]** - Confront the conspirators openly
- Risk civil conflict in Aethermoor
- Gain clear evidence but lose element of surprise **Option 2: [[Covert Investigation**
- Gather evidence secretly
- Risk exposure and retaliation
- Preserve political stability while building case **Option 3: [Double Agent]] Approach**
- Pretend to join the conspiracy
- Gain access to [[The Collector's network
- High risk but potentially high reward ### [The Conspirators]]' [[Meeting Regardless of approach, the party can infiltrate or observe a secret meeting: ### [Read Aloud]] * The meeting takes place on a wind platform suspended between two crystal spires, accessible only by flight. The conspirators speak in hushed tones while the wind carries their words away from the city's memory crystals.* * [[Captain Zephyr's voice is tight with urgency: "[Lord Aurelius]] grows impatient. [[The Queen's condition deteriorates faster than expected. We may need to accelerate the timeline."* * [Trade Minister]] Gale responds: "The resources are in place, but moving against Aquabyssos before the Convergence could unite both realms against us."* * [[Court Mage Tempest adds ominously: "[The Fifth]] Shard's location confirmeded. But retrieving it will require... Sacrifices."* **[[Intelligence Gathered**:
- [The Fifth]] Shard is hidden in [[[[Nimbus Sanctum|[Nimbus Sanctum]]]], the floating monastery
- [[The Collector plans to use the Queen's crystal corruption to create a permanent merge point between realms
- [Time|Time]]line moveded up due to the Queen's deteriorating condition
- They know about the party's activities and consider them a threat ### [[The Floating Monastery [[[Nimbus Sanctum]]|[[Nimbus Sanctum]] is a sacred site that floats high above Luminspire, accessible only to those deemed worthy by the **[[[[Wind Monks|[Wind Monks]]]]**. **[[[[Abbot Serenity Cloudheart|[Abbot Serenity]] Cloudheart]]** - Leader of the [[Wind Monks, keeper of ancient knowledge about the shards. **[[[Brother Gale]] Windwalker|[[Brother Gale Windwalker]]** - Younger monk who has been having prophetic visions about the coming convergence. ### [[The Monks' [Test Before]] accessing the sanctum, the party must prove their worthiness through the **Trials of [[Four Winds**: #### Trial 1: [The Honest]] Wind (Truth) Characters must speak only truth while navigating a maze of wind currents. Any lie causes them to be blown backward.
- **[[Skill Challenge**: 3 successes, any Deception automatically fails #### Trial 2: [The Gentle]] Wind (Compassion) Characters must help others complete the trial, even if it slows their own progress. - **Requires**: Each character must assist at least one other person or creature #### Trial 3: [[The Strong Wind (Courage) Characters face illusions of their greatest fears while crossing increasingly dangerous wind bridges.
- **Wisdom saves **DC 16****: Overcome fear and continue forward #### Trial 4: [The Wise]] Wind (Understanding) Characters must solve riddles that relate to the balance between realms and the nature of power.
- **Intelligence/Wisdom checks **DC 18****: Understand deeper meanings ### [[The Fifth Shard: Shard of [Ascension Located]] in the monastery's highest chamber, the **[[[[Fifth Shard of Ascension|[Fifth Shard]] [[Of Ascension]]** is embedded in a crystal formation that regulates the monastery's flight. **Guardian**: **[[[[The Ascending Spirit|[The Ascending]] Spirit]]** - An ancient monk who achieved wind-body transformation centuries ago. **Stats**: Use **[[Air Elemental** with these modifications: - **Intelligence**: 18
- **Wisdom**: 20
- **Can cast**: *wind walk*, *control weather*, *plane shift* (air elemental plane only)
- **[Monk Abilities]]**: [[Stunning Strike, patient defense, etc.
- **Challenge**: 8 (3,900 XP) ### [The Guardian]]'s [[Challenge Rather than combat, this is a philosophical test: **[The Guardian]]'s Questions**: 1. "Why accomplish you seek power over the winds themselves?"
2. "What will you sacrifice to prevent catastrophe?"
3. "Can you accept responsibility for consequences you cannot foresee?" **excellent answers** demonstrate wisdom and selflessness **Poor answers** result in having to prove worthiness through combat
**Excellent answers** gain the Guardian as a future ally ### [[The Collector's [Ambush As]] the party attempts to claim or secure the [[Fifth Shard, **[The Collector]]'s** agents attack: **Encounter**: - **[[[[Elite Wind [Rider Captain]]|[[Elite Wind [Rider Captain]]]]** (use **[[Knight|Knight** stats with fly speed)
- 4 **[[[Corrupted Crystal]] Guards|[[Corrupted Crystal Guards]]** (use **Guards** with crystal-based attacks)
- 2 **[[[[Court Mage Apprentices|[Court Mage]] Apprentices]]** (use **Mage** stats, reduced spell slots)
- **Environmental**: The monastery's crystals create unstable magic zones **[[Tactical Considerations**:
- Combat occurs on wind platforms at extreme altitude
- Falling is a serious risk (500+ foot drops)
- Crystal formations can be used for cover but may explode if damaged
- Wind currents affect ranged attacks and movement ### [Resolution Options]] **Claim the [[Fifth Shard**: - Gain powerful artifact (control weather, fly at will, resist wind/lightning)
- Destabilize the monastery's flight systems
- create enemies of some [Wind Monks]]
- [[Accelerate The Collector's timeline **Secure the Shard**:
- Work with [Wind Monks]] to hide it better
- Slower power progression but better allies
- [[Deny The Collector access
- Maintain sanctuary status **Destroy the Shard**:
- Prevent anyone from using it
- Potentially catastrophic consequences for Aethermoor
- Gain respect from some factions, enmity from others
- Unknown effects on realm stability ### [Future Session]] Setup - The party should have clear next steps
- Multiple faction relationships should be active
- Time pressure should be increasing
- Set up the transition back to cross-realm activities - -- * "In the heights, perspective changes everything.
