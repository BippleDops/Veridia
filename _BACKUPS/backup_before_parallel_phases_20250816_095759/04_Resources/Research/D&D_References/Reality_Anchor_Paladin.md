The Reality Anchor Paladin represents a sacred order dedicated to maintaining stability between [[Aquabyssos and [Aethermoor]], preventing reality breaches, and protecting both worlds from dimensional threats. These paladins have sworn divine oaths to preserve the integrity of existence itself, serving as living anchors that stabilize reality through divine will and unwavering determination. ## Core Concept

Reality Anchors are paladins who have devoted themselves to the cosmic duty of maintaining dimensional stability. They can sense reality distortions, seal dimensional breaches, and resist corruption from entities that exist outside normal space and time. Many serve in specialized military units, work with reality research institutions, or operate as independent agents protecting communities from dimensional threats. ### Sacred Oath: Oath of Reality Stability

At 3rd level, Reality Anchor Paladins take the Oath of Reality Stability: #### Oath Spells

| Paladin Level | Spells |
|---------------|--------|
| 3rd | *Detect Magic*, *Protection from Evil and Good* |
| 5th | *Dispel Magic*, *Zone of Truth* |
| 9th | *Counterspell*, *Magic Circle* |
| 13th | *Banishment*, *Freedom of Movement* |
| 17th | *Dispel Evil and Good*, *Greater Restoration* | #### Channel Divinity: Reality Anchor (3rd Level)

As an action, become immovable object for 1 minute. During this time:
- Automatically succeed on saves against forced movement
- Immune to dimensional travel effects (willing or unwilling)
- Creatures within 30 feet have advantage on saves against reality distortion
- Can end effect early as bonus action #### Channel Divinity: Dimensional Seal (3rd Level)

As an action, seal minor reality breach within 60 feet. Breach stops expanding for 24 hours and becomes harder to reopen. Major breaches require extended ritual (1 hour) and multiple uses of this ability. #### Master Anchor (20th Level)

As action, become perfect stability anchor for 1 minute:
- Immune to all conditions and forced movement
- Aura extends to 60 feet and grants allies immunity to reality distortion
- Can cast *Banishment* as bonus action without spell slots
- Reality within aura cannot be altered by any means
- Once per long rest ### Feature: Dimensional Authority

Your service in reality protection forces grants you authority in dimensional emergencies and access to government resources for reality stabilization. Military and civilian authorities recognize your expertise in dimensional threats and defer to your judgment during reality crises. ### Paladin/Divination Wizard

Enhanced magical knowledge and reality prediction abilities. ### Paladin/Great Old One Warlock

Understand cosmic threats through limited contact with alien entities. ### Paladin/Tempest Cleric

Divine magic emphasizes order and stability over chaos and change. ### Paladin/Abjuration Wizard

Magical theory enhances protective and reality-stabilizing abilities. ## Cosmic Significance

Reality Anchors serve as the ultimate guardians of dimensional stability, protecting not just individual communities but the very fabric of existence itself. Their divine oaths bind them to duties that transcend normal heroic concerns, making them essential figures in campaigns involving dimensional threats, reality manipulation, and cosmic horror. This build emphasizes the intersection of divine magic and cosmic responsibility, offering both powerful defensive abilities and meaningful roleplay opportunities around duty, sacrifice, and the nature of reality itself. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*
