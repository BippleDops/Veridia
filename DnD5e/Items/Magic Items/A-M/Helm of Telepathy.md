## Description
While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the **[[Detect Thoughts|detect thoughts]]** spell (save [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 13) from it. As long as you maintain [[2 - Casting a Spell|concentration]] on the spell, you can use a [[12 - The Order of Combat|bonus action]] to send a telepathic [[Message|message]] to a creature you are focused on. It can reply—using a [[12 - The Order of Combat|bonus action]] to do so—while your focus on it continues.

While focusing on a creature with [[Detect Thoughts|detect thoughts]], you can use an action to cast the **[[Suggestion|suggestion]]** spell (save [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the **[[Suggestion|suggestion]]** property can’t be used again until the next dawn.
