## Description

A shy, anxious 15-year-old human with innate spellcasting ability. Fearing for the safety of those around her as she learns to control her powers, Shira has taken to using the shrine to the Wild Mother in the Sigil District as a nighttime hiding place. She mimics the behavior of a spirit to frighten away others. Shira uses her spells to drive away intruders.
