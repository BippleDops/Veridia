## Special Traits
**Amorphous:** A glacial ooze can move through gaps as small as 1 square foot as if it's difficult terrain.

**Freezing Embrace:** As it moves, a glacial ooze can enter spaces occupied by Large or smaller creatures. If the creature whose space is being entered makes a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, the creature can move safely out of the glacial ooze's path. If the saving throw fails, the creature is engulfed: it takes 7 (`dice: 2d6`) cold damage immediately, is restrained, can't breathe, and takes 14 (`dice: 4d6`) cold damage at the start of each of the glacial ooze's turns. An engulfed creature can use an action on its turn to try to escape from the glacial ooze; the creature escapes if it makes a successful DC 14 Strength check. A creature adjacent to the glacial ooze can use an action to try to pull one engulfed creature free. The rescue succeeds if the creature makes a successful DC 14 Strength check, and the creature making the check takes 7 (`dice: 2d6`) cold damage whether it succeeds or fails. A glacial ooze can contain up to four creatures that are Medium or smaller, or one Large creature.

**Superchilled:** A glacial ooze's form is extremely cold. Creatures that hit a glacial ooze with natural weapons or with an unarmed attack take 3 (`dice: 1d6`) cold damage per hit.

**Transparent:** A glacial ooze is hard to spot, even under ideal conditions. A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check is needed to notice one, and if the ooze is drifting in water or is surrounded by blowing snow (as it usually is), this check is made with tactical disadvantage. Creatures who blunder into the glacial ooze's space are treated exactly as if the ooze had attacked them with its freezing embrace, but they make the Dex saving throw with tactical disadvantage.

## Description
A glacial ooze is an arctic relative of the gelatinous ooze. Like its cousin, the glacial ooze is nearly invisible. When it can be seen, it appears as no more than a block or wall of clear ice. The desiccated, shriveled remains of creatures can sometimes be seen frozen inside.

Glacial oozes of Huge or even Gargantuan size have been conjectured, but their existence is so far only a rumor.

The glacial ooze is equally at home in an ice cave, prowling the blizzard-riven tundra, or drifting in frigid arctic seas and rivers like a small iceberg. Like most oozes, the glacial ooze is a scavenger that feeds primarily on whatever frozen carcasses it finds—but it doesn’t see much difference between a frozen carcass and a living creature. A glacial ooze doesn’t digest its food, but rather absorbs all fluids and liquids from the body, leaving behind a frozen, shrunken husk.

A glacial ooze prefers to acquire food by just moving onto it and engulfing it. If the food resists, the ooze forms a pseudopod and batters the meal into submission.
