# Quest - Hearts and Minds

**Level:** 5th-8th level characters  
**Sessions:** 5-7 sessions  
**Type:** Political Intrigue/Social/Investigation  

---

## Quest Summary

The floating city of [[New Skyholm]] teeters on the brink of civil war. What began as peaceful protests by the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Groundling Liberation Movement]] has escalated into violent confrontations with the city's [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Skyborn Elite]]. As tensions reach a breaking point, mysterious incidents have begun occurring—bombings blamed on groundling terrorists, but evidence suggests darker forces are manipulating both sides toward inevitable conflict.

The party must navigate the complex web of political intrigue, uncover the true puppet masters behind the escalating violence, and find a way to prevent a war that could tear [[New Skyholm]] apart and destabilize all of [[Aethermoor]]. Success requires more than sword and sorcery—it demands understanding the hearts and minds of a divided people.

---

## Act I: A City Divided

### Opening Hook

The party arrives in [[New Skyholm]] just as the latest protests turn violent. They are approached by one of several potential quest givers:

- **[[Councilor Elena Brightwind]]** (Skyborn moderate) seeks neutral investigators to uncover the truth behind recent bombings
- **[[Marcus Ironwright]]** (Groundling leader) believes his movement is being framed and needs proof of a conspiracy  
- **[[Captain Thalia Stormguard]]** (City Watch) requires outside help to maintain order while investigating threats to both communities
- **[[Ambassador Kael Windweaver]]** (representing the [[Aethermoor Council]]) fears civil war will spread to other floating cities

### The Current Crisis (Sessions 1-2)

**Setting:** [[New Skyholm]], a stratified floating city where the wealthy [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Skyborn Elite]] literally live above the working-class [[Groundling]] districts

#### Key Tensions:
- **Economic:** Groundlings work dangerous jobs maintaining the city's floating mechanisms while Skyborn profit from trade and magic
- **Political:** Skyborn control the [[High Council]] while Groundlings have minimal representation
- **Social:** Centuries of segregation have created deep cultural divides and mutual mistrust
- **Magical:** Skyborn monopolize flight magic and advanced spellcasting education

#### Recent Escalations:
1. **The Dock Incident:** Groundling protesters blockaded sky-docks, costing merchants thousands in lost trade
2. **The Academy Bombing:** An explosion at the [[Skyborn Academy of Aerial Arts]] injured several noble children  
3. **The Sabotage Campaign:** Critical city infrastructure has been damaged, threatening New Skyholm's ability to remain airborne

### Key Investigation Locations

#### The Groundling Quarter
- **Industrial District:** Where city maintenance workers live and work
- **The Anchor Tavern:** Meeting place for [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Groundling Liberation Movement]]
- **Underground Networks:** Literal and figurative—maintenance tunnels and resistance cells

#### The Skyborn Districts  
- **Council Chambers:** Where political decisions are made
- **Noble Estates:** Floating mansions tethered above the main city
- **The Academy:** Elite magical institution and recent bombing target

#### Neutral Zones
- **The Middle Market:** Where both communities reluctantly interact
- **City Watch Headquarters:** Struggling to maintain order
- **The Embassy Quarter:** Foreign representatives observing the crisis

## Act II: Uncovering the Conspiracy

### The Hidden Hand (Sessions 2-4)

As the party investigates, they discover evidence suggesting a third party is manipulating both sides:

#### Key Evidence:
- Bombing components are too sophisticated for typical Groundling access
- Skyborn businesses are secretly funding both moderate Groundlings and Skyborn hardliners
- Foreign agents have been spotted meeting with extremists from both factions
