## Special Traits
**Fungus Bat Poison:** A creature that fails a DC 11 Consti saving throw against fungus bat poison suffers the usual effects of being poisoned. In addition, if the creature typically moves around on legs, it loses the use of its legs for `dice: 1d4` rounds. It falls prone immediately, and it can't stand up again until after the `dice: 1d4` rounds have elapsed. A successful saving throw against fungus bat poison does not impart any immunity against future poisonings.

## Actions
**Bite:*** Melee Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d8+1`) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effect of fungus bat poison (see above).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Underground

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, patch (3–6), or field (6–15)

## Description
Fungus bats are found only in deep caves and more extensive regions of the subterranean world, for they are a very deep-dwelling species. They are uncommon everywhere, however; their colonies are small and few. It is believed they were more numerous in the distant past, but other creatures hunted them near to extinction.

A fungus bat resembles a mass of lumpy mushroom caps with leathery wings. A pair of long tails flap behind it when it flies, giving it a deceptively ungraceful appearance. Their bite carries a venom that affects the lower spine, paralyzing the legs. It’s a short-lived effect, but dangerous—fungus bats tend to swarm creatures that are on the ground to the exclusion of other targets.
