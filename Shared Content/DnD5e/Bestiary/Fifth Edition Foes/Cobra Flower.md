## Description
Cobra flowers draw nutrients from sunlight, soil, and water, but they also enjoy a diet of insects, rodents, animals, and even humanoids when they can catch one. These plantcreatures can be found nesting in forests, and they sometimes take up residence near small population areas to feed on humanoids who wander into their reach. Many a child’s or adult’s disappearance can be attributed to a cobra flower.

When a cobra flower detects a living creature, it remains motionless until its prey is within 5 feet. It then spreads its leafy hood, opens its flowery bulb, and bites its prey, injecting acidic enzymes to break down and digest the victim.
