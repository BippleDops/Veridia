# Ogrémoch

## Lair actions
_Source: Princes of the Apocalypse_

Ogrémoch can assert his dominion over the rock and stone around him to take lair actions on the Elemental Plane of Earth, or in any elemental earth node (including the Black Geode, described in chapter 5). On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Ogrémoch uses his lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- A 10-foot-radius area of rocky or earthy ground within 60 feet of Ogrémoch turns to sticky mud. Any creature on the ground in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or sink 5 feet into the mud and be [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Restrained|restrained]]. A creature can take an action to make a DC 15 Strength check, ending the effect on itself or another creature within its reach on a success.  
- Crystalline spikes grow from the ground in a 20-foot-radius area within 60 feet of Ogrémoch. The area becomes difficult terrain. A creature that moves through the affected area takes `d8` piercing damage for every 5 feet it moves there. Creatures that are knocked [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Prone|prone]] in the area also take this damage.  
- A violent tremor shakes the lair in a 120-foot-radius around Ogrémoch. Each creature other than Ogrémoch on the ground in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity saving throw (target's choice) or be knocked [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Prone|prone]].  

## Regional effects
_Source: Princes of the Apocalypse_

The region containing an elemental node in which Ogrémoch is present is seriously affected, becoming geologically unstable. This creates the following effects:

- Earth tremors strike the region within 10 miles of Ogrémoch's location every `2d12` hours, each lasting `d10` rounds. At first, damage is minor—broken windows, cracked plaster, items toppled off shelves. The longer Ogrémoch remains, the stronger the tremors become. After 5 days, the tremors are strong enough to destroy flimsy structures. After 10 days, they are strong enough to destroy ordinary wooden buildings. After 20 days, they can seriously damage or destroy reinforced or fortified structures.  
- Magnetic disturbances within 10 miles of Ogrémoch prevent compasses from functioning there.  
- Hidden sinkholes and fissures form within 1 mile of Ogrémoch's location. A hidden sinkhole can be spotted from a safe distance by any creature with a passive Wisdom ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Perception|Perception]]) score of 15 or higher or spotted with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Survival|Survival]]) check. Otherwise, the first creature to step on the thin crust covering the sinkhole must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall `1d6 × 10` feet into the sinkhole or fissure.  
- Natural caves and tunnels within 1 mile of Ogrémoch's lair form intermittent portals to the Elemental Plane of Earth, allowing elemental creatures into the mortal world to dwell near those points.  

If Ogrémoch is destroyed or banished back to his home plane, the regional effects fade over the next `d10` days.
