# Lighthouse Peak - Resonance Chamber

*"At the pinnacle where sea meets sky, ancient harmonies still echo."*

## Overview
The Resonance Chamber at Lighthouse Peak is a specialized magical facility built into the highest point of a prominent coastal lighthouse. This chamber contains crystalline formations and magical apparatus designed to amplify and focus magical energies, creating powerful resonance effects that can influence weather patterns, communication networks, and dimensional stability across vast distances.

## Historical Background
Originally built as a navigation aid for ships, the lighthouse was later converted to house the Resonance Chamber when magical researchers discovered the peak's unique acoustic and magical properties.

## Current State
The chamber now serves multiple purposes: weather control, long-distance magical communication, and emergency beacon for inter-realm distress signals. Recent dimensional instabilities have made its operation increasingly unpredictable.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
- Specialized training in resonance magic
- Crystalline focusing components
- Weather-resistant magical apparatus
- Coordination with maritime safety authorities

### Effects
- **Weather Influence**: Limited control over local weather patterns
- **Communication Boost**: Enhances long-distance magical messages
- **Emergency Beacon**: Can send distress signals across realms
- **Dimensional Monitoring**: Detects stability fluctuations

### Duration
Operational continuously with periodic maintenance requirements.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Signal Lost**: The chamber goes silent during a critical emergency
2. **Weather Control**: Someone uses the chamber to create dangerous storms
3. **Dimensional Breach**: Chamber malfunction opens unexpected portals

## Campaign Use
Provides strategic communication hub and potential source of magical complications or solutions.
