--- # Pressure Damage *"The deep demands respect - ignore pressure at your mortal peril."* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Pressure Damage represents the various physical and magical injuries that result from exposure to the crushing depths of Aquabyssos or rapid pressure changes during inter-realm travel. This environmental hazard affects not just surface dwellers venturing underwater, but can also impact underwater inhabitants when magical protection fails or when they travel to areas of extreme depth variation. ## Historical Background

Pressure damage was one of the first hazards documented during early surface-to-depth expeditions. Initial diving attempts resulted in catastrophic casualties until magical protection methods were developed. ## Current State

Modern understanding includes both physical pressure effects and magical pressure damage caused by dimensional stress. Protection methods have improved but remain imperfect. ### Requirements

Occurs during:
- Unprotected deep-water diving
- Rapid pressure changes
- Magical protection failure
- Exposure to pressure-based attacks ### Duration

Immediate damage with potential long-term complications requiring magical healing. ## Adventure Hooks

1. Additionally, **Deep Rescue**: Characters must save someone suffering severe pressure damage
2. **Equipment Failure**: Pressure protection fails during critical mission
3. **Pressure Warfare**: Combat involving pressure-based attacks ## Campaign Use

Provides realistic environmental challenges and consequences for deep-water exploration. ## Player-Facing Summary Pressure Damage is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Pressure Damage as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Pressure Damage. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Alliance - Manipulate succession
