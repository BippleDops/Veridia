# Deep Mother Mutation - Transformation Rules

## Overview
Deep Mother Mutation represents the most dangerous form of transformation in both [[Aquabyssos]] and [[Aethermoor]]. Exposure to the [[Deep Mother]]'s influence causes rapid and profound changes to both mind and body, transforming victims into servants of an incomprehensible cosmic entity. Unlike other transformations, Deep Mother mutations actively seek to spread and corrupt others.

## Exposure Sources

**Reality Breach**: Direct manifestation threatens to transform entire region

### Moral Dilemmas
- Can someone with Stage 3 transformation be considered the same person?
- Is killing Deep Mother touched an act of mercy or murder?
- Should transformed individuals be quarantined or treated as refugees?
- How much cosmic knowledge is safe for mortals to possess?

### Environmental Effects
**Reality Distortion Zones**: Areas around advanced transformations warp physics
**Corruption Spread**: Deep Mother influence spreads through direct contact
**Dimensional Tears**: Severe cases can create permanent breaches in reality
**Psychic Resonance**: Multiple transformed individuals amplify each other's power

## DM Guidelines

### Pacing Transformation
- Allow saves at story-appropriate moments to slow or halt progression
- Provide clear warning signs before point of no return
- Offer multiple treatment options with different costs and risks
- Consider temporary stabilization to extend roleplay opportunities

### Roleplay Considerations
- Gradual personality changes are more effective than sudden shifts
- Preserve core character elements until final stages
- Allow player agency in describing transformation experience
- Provide hope for recovery until Stage 4 transformation

### Balance Considerations
- Transformation grants power but at cost of player agency
- Abilities scale with transformation stage but come with severe drawbacks
- Treatment should be possible but require significant effort and resources
- NPCs should react appropriately to obviously transformed characters

## Research Notes
*Deep Mother mutations appear to be part of a larger pattern of cosmic infection spreading across multiple realities. The entity's ultimate goals remain unclear, but evidence suggests it seeks to transform entire planes of existence into extensions of its own consciousness.*

*Latest studies indicate that strong emotional connections and divine protection provide the best defense against initial infection. However, no known cure exists for Stage 4 transformation.*

*All research materials require special containment to prevent accidental exposure. Researchers must undergo daily screening and work in teams with reality anchors and divine protection.*

**Warning**: This transformation represents an existential threat to player agency and campaign stability. Use sparingly and always provide hope for recovery or prevention until the final stage.
