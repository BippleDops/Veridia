***Rising Anger.*** If another creature deals damage to the Angry, the Angry's attack rolls have advantage until the end of its next turn, and the first time it hits with a hook attack on its next turn, the attack's target takes an extra 19 ( `dice: 3d12`) psychic damage.
On its turn, the Angry has disadvantage on attack rolls if no other creature has dealt damage to it since the end of its last turn.

***Hook.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 ( `dice: 2d12+3`) piercing damage.

## Description
Relying on violence to sustain their existence, the Angry grow more powerful when their foes fight back. If a creature opts not to attack, though, the Angry becomes confused, and its attacks weaken. Each of the Angry has two heads, which bicker with each other until they find something else on which they can vent their wrath.
