# Missing Persons of Port Meridian

*"They vanish without trace, leaving only questions behind."*

## Overview
A complex investigation quest involving a series of mysterious disappearances in Port Meridian. Over the past six months, seventeen residents have vanished without leaving any conventional traces, creating panic among the population and baffling local authorities.

The missing persons come from all social classes and backgrounds, with no apparent connection except their residence in Port Meridian.

## The Pattern
**Victim Profile**: No clear demographic pattern - ages 16-60, various professions
**Disappearance Method**: Vanish from secure locations with no signs of struggle
**Timing**: Irregular intervals, sometimes weeks apart, sometimes multiple in one night
**Evidence**: No physical traces, witnesses report strange lights or sounds
**Aftermath**: Belongings left undisturbed, no ransom demands or explanations

## Key Missing Persons

**Lady Catherine Brightwater**: Noble, vanished from guarded manor
**Tom Youngfish**: Street performer, last seen in busy market square
**Dr. Eliza Stormcaller**: Scholar, disappeared from university library
**The Hartwell Children**: Twin siblings, vanished from their bedroom

## Investigation Methods
**Witness Interviews**: Question families, friends, and last contacts
**Scene Examination**: Search disappearance sites for magical or physical clues
**Pattern Analysis**: Look for connections between victims and locations
**Surveillance**: Watch potential targets or suspicious locations
**Magical Investigation**: Detect supernatural involvement

## Potential Theories
**Human Trafficking**: Organized criminal kidnapping operation
**Cult Activity**: Religious group taking victims for unknown purposes
**Magical Experiment**: Wizard or organization testing teleportation/summoning
**Extra-Planar**: Creatures from another dimension abducting humans
**Government Conspiracy**: Official cover-up of relocated witnesses or experiments

## Key NPCs

**Worried Mother Sarah**: Lost her teenage son, desperate for answers
**Informant "Whisper"**: Criminal contact with underground information
**Sage Cornelius**: Expert on magical phenomena and planar activity
**Harbor Master Erik**: Has noticed unusual ship traffic patterns

## Investigation Locations
**The Missing Houses**: Homes where people disappeared, may contain clues
**Port Authority**: Records of ships and cargo that might be relevant
**Underground Taverns**: Where criminals and informants gather
**The University**: Research into magical theories behind disappearances
**Abandoned Warehouses**: Potential holding or ritual locations

## Clues and Evidence
**Magical Residue**: Faint traces of conjuration magic at some sites
**Witness Accounts**: Descriptions of strange lights or sounds
**Financial Records**: Some victims had recent unusual transactions
**Travel Documents**: Suspicious ship manifests or passenger lists
**Personal Items**: Belongings that might reveal victim connections

## The Truth (DM Options)
**Option A**: Planar cult summoning victims to another dimension
**Option B**: Government agency relocating people for protection program
**Option C**: Criminal organization with magical backing
**Option D**: Extra-dimensional creature collecting humans
**Option E**: Time travel experiment gone wrong

## Challenges
- Limited physical evidence makes investigation difficult
- Public panic and pressure for quick results
- Official authorities may be hiding information
- Perpetrators actively working to avoid detection
- False leads and red herrings confuse the investigation

## Quest Resolution
**Investigation Success**: Discover the truth and location of missing persons
**Rescue Mission**: Attempt to recover victims from wherever they're held
**Prevention**: Stop future disappearances by eliminating the threat
**Justice**: Bring perpetrators to face consequences for their actions

## Rewards
