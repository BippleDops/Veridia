While holding Wave, you gain the following benefits:

## Aquatic Command

Wave has 3 charges and regains `d3` expended charges daily at dawn. While you carry it, you can expend 1 charge to cast [[beast]] (save DC 20) from it on a Beast that has a [[swim-speed-xphb (variant-rules)]].

## Globe of Invulnerability

While holding Wave, you can cast the level 9 version of [[Vulnerability Xphb]] from it. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.

## Sentience

Wave is a sentient weapon of Neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and [[senses#Darkvision|Darkvision]] out to 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and speaks Aquan.

## Personality

Wave zealously encourages mortals to worship sea gods and has a habit of humming sea chanteys. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to further the weapon's objectives in the world.

## Destroying Wave

Wave can be destroyed only on the island of Thunderforge, where it was forged. The weapon must be melted down by a [[giant]] or someone imbued with a storm giant's strength. Destroying Wave angers a god of the sea, who sends powerful agents to attack the island and punish the destroyers.
