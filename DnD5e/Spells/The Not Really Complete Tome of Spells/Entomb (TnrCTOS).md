# Entomb (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, M (a small cube of stone scored with lines on each side)

**Duration**: 10 minutes


## Effects
You point to one Large or smaller creature within range that is standing on natural, unworked earth, sand, rock, or a similar material (or on vegetation that is on top of such a material). A block of solid stone rises out of the ground and engulfs the target within. The target may make a Dexterity saving throw to resist. For the duration of the spell, the target is subjected to the petrified condition. If the creature has the ability to pass through solid stone and does not need to activate that ability (such as if the creature is naturally immaterial), then it cannot be affected by this spell. When the spell expires, the stone crumbles away, leaving the engulfed target unharmed.
