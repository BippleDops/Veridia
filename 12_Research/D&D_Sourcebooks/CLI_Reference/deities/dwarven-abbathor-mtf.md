# Abbathor
*Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 73* 

- **Alignment**: Neutral Evil
- **Category**: The Mordinsamman
- **Domains**: Trickery
- **Pantheon**: Dwarven
- **Province**: Greed
- **Symbol**: Jeweled dagger, point down

The Great Master of Greed exerts an influence, no matter how subtle, over every dwarven heart. Abbathor teaches that greed isn't only desirable, but necessary to keep the dwarves in a strong and safe position.

Abbathor has no skill in crafting. Instead, he relies on his ability as a thief to take ownership of what he wants. Why work so hard to manufacture something when a much easier path to riches lies open?

Abbathor is the only advocate for change within the dwarven pantheon. He can inspire dwarves to seek shortcuts, normally frowned upon, but sometimes those methods turn out to be efficient techniques that improve a clan's capabilities.
