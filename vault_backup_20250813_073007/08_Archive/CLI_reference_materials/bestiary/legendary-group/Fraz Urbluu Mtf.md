# Fraz-Urb'luu

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_

On Initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Fraz-Urb'luu can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Fraz-Urb'luu causes up to 5 doors within the lair to become walls, and an equal number of doors to appear on walls where there previously were none.  
- Fraz-Urb'luu chooses one humanoid within the lair and instantly creates a simulacrum of that creature (as if created with the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/simulacrum-xphb|simulacrum]] spell). This simulacrum obeys Fraz-Urb'luu's commands and is destroyed on the next initiative count 20.  
- Fraz-Urb'luu creates a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/wave-xdmg|wave]] of anguish. Each creature he can see within the lair must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or take 33 (`6d10`) psychic damage.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_

The region containing Fraz-Urb'luu's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- Intelligent creatures within 1 mile of the lair frequently see hallucinations of long-dead friends and comrades that vanish after only a brief glimpse.  
- Roads and paths within 6 miles of the lair twist and turn back on themselves, making navigation in the area exceedingly difficult.  
- If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Fraz-Urb'luu table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.  

If Fraz-Urb'luu dies, these effects fade over the course of `d10` days.

### Madness of Fraz-Urb'luu

If a creature goes mad in Fraz-Urb'luu's lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Fraz-Urb'luu table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for more on madness.

| dice: d100 | Flaw (lasts until cured) |
|------------|--------------------------|
| 01–20 | "I never let anyone know the truth about my actions or intentions, even if doing so would be beneficial to me." |
| 21–40 | "I have intermittent hallucinations and fits of catatonia." |
| 41–60 | "My mind wanders as I have elaborate fantasies that have no bearing on reality. When I return my focus to the world, I have a hard time remembering that it was just a daydream." |
| 61–80 | "I convince myself that things are true, even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary." |
| 81–00 | "My perception of reality doesn't match anyone else's. It makes me prone to violent delusions that make no sense to anyone else." |
