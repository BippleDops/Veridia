# Nerve Dance (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a six-inch strand of red spider silk and a torch)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
You hold your hand out and three glowing red streamers shoot out. Each of these streamers wraps around a target of your choice within range, using your spell attack modifier to hit.

On a hit, they wrap around a target, grappling it (escape DC equal to your spell save DC), and must make a Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes 7d6 psychic dam-age and is incapacitated due to incredible pain for 1 minute on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage and is incapacitated for the next round on a successful one.
