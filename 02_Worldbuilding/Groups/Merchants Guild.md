# Merchants Guild

## General Info
**Location**: Shadowhaven

## Description
The Merchants Guild is a powerful and influential guild that controls all of the legitimate trade in and out of Shadowhaven. They are a force to be reckoned with, and they are not afraid to use their wealth and influence to protect their interests.

## GM Notes
- The guild is led by a council of wealthy merchants, including Lady Seraphina Goldleaf.
- The guild is a rival of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Thieves Guild.md]] and the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Crimson Fleet.md]].
- The guild is a potential patron for the party, but they will expect a hefty price for their services.


## Connections

- [[Shadow Surgeons Collective]]

## Player-Facing Summary

Merchants Guild is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Merchants Guild as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Merchants Guild.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Merchants Guild to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at Merchants Guild to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to Merchants Guild active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
