*This creature is a long, slender (relative to its length), reddish-brown monster with yellow mottling across its back. Its body tapers toward its head, which is mostly mouth —a circular maw lined with multiple rows of steel-hard teeth that allow it to chew through rocks and earth as it burrows underground.*

## Description
The death worm is a reclusive, desertdwelling creature content to spend its life burrowing beneath the ground and sustaining itself on a diet of sand and earth. On occasion, it surfaces to devour more substantial prey (animals such as camels, desert dogs, and humanoids). The combination of its ferocious teeth, acidic saliva that it spits with great accuracy, and lightning generated by a mysterious organ in its head makes the death worm a seldom-seen but much feared legend in the desert.

Death worms lay their eggs far beneath the surface of the earth. Newborn death worms live on a diet of sand and earth; only when they reach maturity (two to five years after hatching) do they surface in search of their first living prey.
