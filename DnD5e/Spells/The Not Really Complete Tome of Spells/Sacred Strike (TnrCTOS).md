# Sacred Strike (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (two drops of unholy water and one of your hairs)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You create a whip of magical force that is always silent. It has a range of 10 feet and you use your spell attack modifier to strike. On a hit, it inflicts 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier in force damage and 1d8 necromantic damage. If the target is a living creature, it must also make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, you heal a number of hit points equal to the necromantic damage inflicted and the target is wracked by terrible pains. The target is at disadvantage to all rolls on the following round.
