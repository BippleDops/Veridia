# Philter of Love
*Potion, uncommon*  

- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you are [[conditions#Charmed|charmed]] by that creature and have the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] condition for 1 hour.

This rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.
