Memory Merchant Valeria describes a turning current in history where choices about memory, depth, and sovereignty reshaped travel, trade, and ritual. ## Player-Facing Summary Memory Merchant Valeria is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.

Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Memory Merchant Valeria. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology.
