# Campaign Epilogues
*Concluding the Adventures of Both Worlds*

> *"Every tale must find its ending, but in the depths where time flows differently and on surfaces where hope rebuilds what despair has broken, endings become new beginnings. The choices made in darkness echo into light, and what heroes achieve reverberates through generations yet unborn."*
> â€” [[Chronicle Keeper Sage Deepmemory]], Historian of the [[United Councils of Both Worlds]]

## Overview

Campaign Epilogues provide comprehensive frameworks for concluding adventures set in the interconnected worlds of [[Aquabyssos]] and [[Aethermoor]], offering structured approaches to resolving character arcs, addressing the consequences of player actions, and establishing the future state of both realms based on campaign outcomes. These epilogue structures recognize that campaigns in this setting often involve complex, interconnected challenges that require thoughtful resolution and long-term consequence consideration.

The epilogue frameworks account for the unique characteristics of campaigns spanning both underwater and surface environments, addressing how player actions in one realm affect the other and providing guidance for resolving the cosmic-scale threats and alliance relationships that define the setting. These structures help game masters create satisfying conclusions while establishing foundations for potential future adventures.

Different epilogue approaches address various campaign types, from focused adventures dealing with specific threats to epic campaigns spanning both worlds and addressing fundamental challenges facing the civilizations. Each approach provides specific guidance for character resolution, world state determination, and consequence integration that maintains consistency with the setting's established themes and relationships.

The epilogue frameworks also address the unique challenges of concluding campaigns in a setting where individual actions can have world-spanning consequences, providing guidance for determining appropriate scales of impact while maintaining believable outcomes that honor player agency and character development.
