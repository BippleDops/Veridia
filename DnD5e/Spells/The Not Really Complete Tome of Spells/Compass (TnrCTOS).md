# Compass (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *1st-level*

**School**: *divination*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a brass bowl filled with water, an iron needle, and a cork)

**Duration**: 1 week


## Effects
You use the pin, cork, and brass bowl to make a simple compass. However, instead of pointing to magnetic north, the needle points to a direction of choice, such as your home port or your destination (if you previously knew what it was).

The spell ends if the water is drained from the bowl or the cork or needle is removed.
