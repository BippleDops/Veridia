There you performed rites in honor of a god or pantheon. You served under a priest and studied religion.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of acolyte xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around acolyte xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
