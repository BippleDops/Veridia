# Mangonel
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 97*  

A Mangonel is a catapult that hurls heavy projectiles in a high arc, so it can hit targets behind walls. Loading a Mangonel requires two [Utilize](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Utilize) actions, and aiming it requires two more [Utilize](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Utilize) actions. Then a crew member can take the Mangonel Stone action.
