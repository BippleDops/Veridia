## Special Traits
***Death Throes.*** When the balor dies, it explodes, and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (`dice: 20d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried, and it destroys the balor's weapons.

***Fire Aura.*** At the start of each of the balor's turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes 10 (`dice: 3d6`) fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches the balor or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (`dice: 3d6`) fire damage.

***Magic Resistance.*** The balor has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The balor's weapon attacks are magical.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The balor makes two attacks: one with its longsword and one with its whip.

***Longsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (`dice: 3d8+8`) slashing damage plus 13 (`dice: 3d8`) lightning damage. If the balor scores a critical hit, it rolls damage dice three times, instead of twice.

***Whip.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (`dice: 2d6+8`) slashing damage plus 10 (`dice: 3d6`) fire damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 25 feet toward the balor.

***Teleport.*** The balor magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

***Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day).*** The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.

A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other [[Demons|demons]]. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

## Description
Figures of ancient and terrible evil, balors rule as generals over demonic armies, yearning to seize power while destroying any creatures that oppose them.

Wielding a flaming whip and a longsword that channels the power of the storm, a balor's battle prowess is fueled by hatred and rage. It channels this demonic fury in its death throes, falling within a blast of fire that can destroy even the hardiest foes.
