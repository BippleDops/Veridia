## Description

 Great Kroom is a purple worm that comes to the Dankwood every twenty years to feed on all kinds of stuff that grows under the forest.

The Great Kroom is a terrifying and dangerous monster that could easily destroy Gob-Town but there are ways to stop it:

- You need to find a tickling stick. This magical stick can be used on a purple worm to tickle it into a docile state. Then it can be led away from the Dankwood.
- You need to have it eat a rare mushroom called a Pun derpuff. This mushroom grows deep in the Dankwood and has a powerful chemical that can put a purple worm to sleep.

## Environment

desert, underdark
