# Downtime Activity: Carousing
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 128* 

Characters can spend their downtime engaged in a variety of hedonistic activities such as attending parties, binge drinking, gambling, or anything else that helps them cope with the perils they face on their adventures.

A carousing character spends money as though maintaining a wealthy lifestyle (see chapter 5, ""Equipment"," of the "Player's Handbook"). At the end of the period spent carousing, the player rolls percentile dice and adds the character's level, then compares the total to the Carousing table to determine what happens to the character, or you choose.

**Carousing**

| d100 + Level | Result |
|--------------|--------|
| 01-10 | You are jailed for `d4` days at the end of the downtime period on charges of disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace. You can pay a fine of 10 gp to avoid jail time, or you can try to resist arrest. |
| 11-20 | You regain consciousness in a strange place with no memory of how you got there, and you have been robbed of `3d6 Ã— 5` gp. |
| 21-30 | You make an enemy. This person, business, or organization is now hostile to you. The DM determines the offended party. You decide how you offended them. |
| 31-40 | You are caught up in a whirlwind romance. Roll a `d20`. On a 1â€“5, the romance ends badly. On a 6â€“10, the romance ends amicably. On an 11â€“20, the romance is ongoing. You determine the identity of the love interest, subject to your DM's approval. If the romance ends badly, you might gain a new flaw. If it ends well or is ongoing, your new love interest might represent a new bond. |
| 41-80 | You earn modest winnings from gambling and recuperate your lifestyle expenses for the time spent carousing. |
| 81-90 | You earn modest winnings from gambling. You recuperate your lifestyle expenses for the time spent carousing and gain ` Ã— 4` gp. |
| 91-100 | You make a small fortune gambling. You recuperate your lifestyle expenses for the time spent carousing and gain `4d6 Ã— 10` gp. Your carousing becomes the stuff of local legend. |
