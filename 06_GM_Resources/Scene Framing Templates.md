## 📝 Scene Framing Checklist

Before starting any scene:
- [ ] Know the scene's purpose
- [ ] Identify spotlight character(s)
- [ ] Have sensory details ready
- [ ] Prepare NPC voices/mannerisms
- [ ] Know potential outcomes
- [ ] Set stakes clearly
- [ ] Start in media res
- [ ] End with question/choice

---

## 🎬 Cliffhanger Endings

### End scenes with:
- A question that demands answer
- A choice that requires decision
- A revelation that changes everything
- A threat that demands action
- A mystery that demands investigation

### Never end with:
- "So what do you do now?"
- Complete resolution
- Everyone agreeing
- No tension
- Unclear stakes

---

*Remember: Every scene should advance story, develop character, or raise stakes. If it doesn't do at least one, cut it and frame something that does.*

**The perfect scene starts with a bang, middles with meaning, and ends with a gasp.**
