# Temple of Divine Order

## General Info
**Location**: [[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/Locations/Shadowhaven]]

## Description
The Temple of Divine Order is a powerful and influential religious organization that is dedicated to upholding the law and punishing the wicked. They are led by the charismatic and zealous [[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/NPCs/High Priestess Seraphina Lightbringer]], and they are a force to be reckoned with.

## GM Notes
- The temple is a potential ally for the party, but they are also very rigid and uncompromising in their beliefs.
- The temple is a rival of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Factions/Thieves Guild.md]] and the [[02_Worldbuilding/Factions/The Shadowhaven Smugglers Ring.md]].
- The temple has a secret army of holy warriors who are ready to be called upon at a moment's notice.
