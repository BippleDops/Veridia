# Mistaken Missive (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (three drops of ink)

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
You cast this spell on up to ten pages of text. Over the course of a week, the text will slowly change.

On the first day, it will become faint, as if the writer was running out of ink. On the second through fourth days, the words be-come gibberishâ€”the text is aligned in groups of letters and punctuation, but nearly all the words are meaningless. On the fifth day, the letters have become real words, but the sentences make no sense. On the sixth day, and thereafter, the message is coherent but con-veys the exact opposite of the original meaning.
