# The Sundered Vaults
*Where Gods' Treasures Sleep and Ancient Powers Wake*

## Overview
Hidden deep within [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Sundered Peaks]], the Sundered Vaults are a vast underground complex built by the ancient civilization that predated both surface kingdoms and the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Ancient Mer-Folk Empire]]. These vaults contain the most dangerous artifacts and forbidden knowledge of a bygone age, protected by mechanical guardians, magical traps, and the lingering will of their creators. Many believe one of the Seven Shards lies hidden in the deepest chamber.
