## Overview

Shadow corruption describes the slow encroachment of null-pressure and memory voids into living systems and built places. It presents first as chill, desaturation of color, and the auditory sense of distance.

## Manifestations

- Memory pitting: recent events feel grainy or missing around affected sites.
- Light bleed: edges of light seem to pull inward; shadows detach from sources.
- Voice drift: speech echoes with a half-beat delay even in small rooms.

## Causes

- Prolonged exposure to void tears or star-silt.
- Use of imperfect reality anchors or cracked prism cores.
- Rituals that trade certainty for power.

## Progression

1. Ambient anomalies: cosmetic effects, DC 12 detection with Arcana or Religion.
2. Behavioral slip: NPCs repeat words, misname friends; DC 15 to notice patterns.
3. Ontic shear: objects lose weight or sound; DC 17 to stabilize with anchors.
4. Null blossom: patch of space resists interaction; only true names or bonded symbols function.

## Mitigation

- Lay a triad of tuned pressure-stones around the site and chant the counter-hum in unison.
- Flood the area with biolum spores; light re-seeding stabilizes edges.
- Replace cracked prisms and recalibrate anchors to local tide harmonics.

## Adventure Hooks

- A noble district’s shadows arrive before their owners; the council hires discrete fixers.
- A ship’s wake carries a null-sheen that erases charts; only an old lighthouse remembers the route.
- A pilgrimage site whispers wrong names; pilgrims vanish into a quiet corridor that wasn’t there yesterday.

## DM Notes

Use visual cues (desaturated props, muffled audio) and escalating mechanical effects. Offer players tradeoffs: quick fixes invite lingering side effects; thorough rituals require rare components.
