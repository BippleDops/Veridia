Cantrips (at will): *light, mending, prestidigitation, ray of frost*

\*Transmutation spell of 1st level or higher

***Transmuter's Stone.*** The transmuter carries a magic stone it crafted that grants its bearer one of the following effects:

- Darkvision out to a range of 60 feet
- An extra 10 feet of speed while the bearer is unencumbered
- Proficiency with Constitution saving throws
- Resistance to acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage (transmuter's choice whenever the transmuter chooses this benefit)

If the transmuter has the stone and casts a transmutation spell of 1st level or higher, it can change the effect of the stone.

## Description
Transmuters are specialist wizards who embrace change, rail against the status quo, and view magical transmutation as a path to riches, enlightenment, or apotheosis.
