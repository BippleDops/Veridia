## Description
I sit and watch warhorses run into battle and I feel sorry. Their eyes and brains are in front, their throats are showing, their hearts are wide open. Even if they have barding they still have no weapons to use. The horse, too, is ten times as strong as the man who rides and swings his little tiny sword. So I think to myself how to help warhorses fight for themselves in battle and how to use their great strength.

Then I saw the men out working to harvest wheat and I thought of this [[Scythe|scythe]] wagon. I have two types: one with blades in front and one with blades in back. The blades are ten foot and very sharp. They spin from the wheels of the wagon. when they hit somebody, he says REEEEP what just happened to him. Front: 75 gp Back 60 gp.
