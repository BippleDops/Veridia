# Scroll of Titan Summoning
*Scroll, legendary*  



When you take a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to read this scroll, a particular titan named in the scroll appears in an unoccupied space on the ground or in water that you can see within 1 mile of yourself. The DM picks a suitable titan or determines it randomly by rolling on the table below.

The titan is [Hostile](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hostile-attitude-xphb.md) toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). If the titan is summoned into a space that isn't large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted.
