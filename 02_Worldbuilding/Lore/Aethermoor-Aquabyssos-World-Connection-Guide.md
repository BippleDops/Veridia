5. Keep consistent internal logic

### Tonal Balance

- Wonder vs Horror
- Hope vs Despair
- Unity vs Division
- Progress vs Tradition
- Known vs Unknown

> *"In [[The Space Between Worlds]], all possibilities exist simultaneously. The question isn't which world survives, but what new world emerges from their collision."*
