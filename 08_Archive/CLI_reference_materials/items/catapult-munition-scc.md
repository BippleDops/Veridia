# Catapult Munition
*Adventuring gear*  



A catapult munition roughly the size and weight of a cannonball.

The munition can be thrown up to 30 feet and explodes on impact. Any creature within a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the point of impact must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (`10d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, each object in that area that isn't being worn or carried takes 35 (`10d6`) fire damage.
