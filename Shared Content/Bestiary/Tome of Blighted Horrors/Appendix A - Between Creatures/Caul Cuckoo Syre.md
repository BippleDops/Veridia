## Special Traits
**Salt Vulnerability:** A handful of salt burns a [[Caul Cuckoo|caul cuckoo]] syre as though it was alchemist’s fire, doing `dice: 1d4` fire damage at the start of the [[Caul Cuckoo|caul cuckoo]]’s turn until it’s extinguished by spending an action to make a successful DC 10 Dex check.

## Actions
**Ranged Attack—Lullaby:** When a [[Caul Cuckoo|caul cuckoo]] syre wails its lullaby, it targets one creature within 30 feet which must succeed on a DC 13 Wis saving throw or fall unconscious. Creatures with 5 or more HD are immune. A creature that saves successfully is immune to all [[Caul Cuckoo|caul cuckoo]] syre lullabies for 24 hours. An unconscious creature wakes up after 1 minute, when it takes damage, or when another creature uses an action to awaken it.

## Description
**Environment**: Any land (Between)

**Organization**: Solitary

[[Caul Cuckoo|Caul cuckoo]] syres are the progenitors of [[Caul Cuckoo|caul cuckoos]]. They spend the majority of their lives stealthily searching out pregnant humanoid females to infest, so they can corrupt their unborn children into [[Caul Cuckoo|caul cuckoos]]. A [[Caul Cuckoo|caul cuckoo]] syre can detect pregnant humanoids within 60 feet by smell. Strangely, [[Caul Cuckoo|caul cuckoo]] syres are also attracted by the odor of some ghouls, which consider [[Caul Cuckoo|caul cuckoo]] syres to be quite the delicacy.

When a [[Caul Cuckoo|caul cuckoo]] syre locates a pregnant potential host, it crawls into the woman’s womb while she’s asleep. Over the course of the next five days, it slowly dissolves into the developing embryo, bathing it in unnatural hormones. The woman experiences severe morning sickness during those five days; a successful DC 13 Wis (Medicine) check made by a character with proficiency in Medicine spots the difference between this sickness and typical morning sickness. By the end of the five days, the syre is completely gone and the fetus is transformed into a [[Caul Cuckoo|caul cuckoo]].

If the syre’s presence is detected or even suspected, it can be removed with a successful DC 15 Wis (Medicine) check. The check can be repeated as many times as necessary, but if it fails by 5 or more, the host takes `dice: 1d6` slashing damage (which can easily kill a commoner with 4 or fewer hit points). Lesser restoration or comparable magic destroys a [[Caul Cuckoo|caul cuckoo]] syre automatically and restores the fetus to normal health.
