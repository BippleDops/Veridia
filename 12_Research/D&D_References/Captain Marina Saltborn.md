Captain Marina Saltborn commands the deepest patrol vessels in the [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] naval fleet, specializing in exploring and defending the [[The Hadal Depths]] where few dare to venture. Born with a rare condition that allows her to survive at crushing depths without magical aid, she's become both invaluable to the navy and increasingly isolated from surface-dwelling humanity.

## Player-Facing Summary

Captain Marina Saltborn is a depth-adapted naval officer and explorer of the deepest ocean trenches surrounding Aquabyssos. Her unique physiology allows her to survive at crushing depths, making her invaluable for protecting the city from deep-sea threats. However, her ongoing transformation from human to something else creates complex personal and professional challenges.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Captain Marina Saltborn as a bridge between the surface world and the mysterious depths. Sailors describe seeing her bioluminescent markers in the deepest waters, always appearing where the need is greatest. Some whisper that she's becoming more sea creature than human, while others claim she's chosen by [[The Deep Mother]] herself.

## DM Notes

Marina works best as a complex ally who provides access to impossible locations and unique perspectives. Her ongoing transformation creates natural tension - she's invaluable but increasingly alien. Use her deep-sea knowledge to drive exploration-based adventures while exploring themes of belonging, transformation, and the cost of being special. Her connection to [[The Deep Mother]] can serve as a hook for cosmic horror or divine favor depending on campaign tone.
