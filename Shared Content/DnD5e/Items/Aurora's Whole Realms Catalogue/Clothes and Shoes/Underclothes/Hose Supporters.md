## Description
Does the slippage in your old pair of hose distress you? Your girth has shrunk, but your hose remain serviceable? We have just the thing for you! Our hose supporters will bolster the sagging spirits of your [[Hosiery|hosiery]]. Made of the finest Cormyrian horse leather, our hose supporters (2 gp) use buckles and [[Straps|straps]] that allow them to adjust to any size. 

The advantage of using a hose supporter rather than the typical, over-used belt is that none need see that oneâ€™s hose fit less than perfectly; hose supports can be worn beneath clothing. The leather can be dyed to specifications for only an additional 1 sp per order.
