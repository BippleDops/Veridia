## Creation Myth & Cosmology

### The Three Truths of Creation

Every culture has creation myths, but three truths appear in all:

1. **The Dreaming Dark**: Before anything, there was the Deep Mother, dreaming alone in the void
2. **The First Awakening**: Her loneliness created the first reality - a single world of perfect unity
3. **The Sundering**: 300 years ago, that world split into Aquabyssos and Aethermoor

### The Nature of Reality

**The Dream Theory** (Most Accepted)
- Reality exists within the Deep Mother's sleeping mind
- Physical laws are her unconscious rules
- Magic is lucid dreaming within her dream
- Death is waking from one dream level to another

**The Bubble Theory** (Scientific)
- Multiple realities exist as bubbles in an infinite sea
- The Sundering created two bubbles from one
- Bubbles can merge, split, or pop
- The Deep Mother is the sea itself

**The Prison Theory** (Heretical)
- Reality is a prison keeping the Deep Mother asleep
- The gods are her jailers
- Mortals are antibodies preventing her wake
- The Sundering weakened the prison

### The Dimensional Structure
