# Medical Ethics in Plague Crisis

*"When plague strikes, every medical decision becomes a moral battleground where saving one life may doom another."*

## Overview

The intersection of medical practice and ethical decision-making becomes particularly complex during plague outbreaks, especially when supernatural corruption complicates traditional disease models. This guide explores the moral dilemmas faced by healers, administrators, families, and communities when medical resources are scarce and the nature of illness itself is in question.

## The Unique Challenge of Shadow Plague

### Traditional Plague vs. Shadow Plague
**Traditional Plague Ethics**:
- Clear disease progression
- Established treatment protocols
- Death as the primary negative outcome
- Recovery as the clear positive goal

**Shadow Plague Ethics**:
- Unclear relationship between disease and consciousness alteration
- Unknown long-term effects of treatment
- Questions about whether "recovery" is always desirable
- Transformation as neither death nor traditional healing

### The Consciousness Question
The core ethical dilemma: Are shadow-touched individuals still the same person, and what constitutes "harm" when consciousness itself changes?

## Major Medical Ethics Dilemmas

### 1. Triage During Outbreak

#### **The Resource Allocation Crisis**
**Situation**: Healing supplies can treat only 40% of the infected. Multiple triage systems are proposed:

**Proposed Systems**:
- **First Come, First Served**: Fair but inefficient
- **Greatest Need**: Treat the sickest first
- **Best Chance**: Treat those most likely to recover
- **Social Value**: Prioritize essential workers and leaders
- **Random Selection**: Lottery system for fairness

**The Harbor District Decision**
*Case Study*: When plague hits Bexley's harbor district, the following patients arrive simultaneously:
- **Marina Tidecaller** (dock worker, 3 children, 60% survival chance)
- **Scholar Deepmind** (plague researcher, no family, 40% survival chance but research critical)
- **Elder Coralwise** (district leader, aged, 20% survival chance but community depends on him)
- **Child Brightcurrent** (orphaned, 90% survival chance, whole life ahead)

**Stakeholder Perspectives**:
- **Healers**: Professional duty to treat all equally
- **Families**: Desperate advocacy for their loved ones
- **Community Leaders**: Utilitarian calculations for society
- **Religious Orders**: Divine will vs. human intervention
- **Working Class**: Suspicion of class-based discrimination

**Escalating Complications**:
- False information about survival chances
- Political pressure to treat connected individuals
- Religious objections to "playing god"
- Community violence when triage becomes public
- Healers' psychological trauma from choosing

### 2. Shadow Surgery Consent

#### **The Consciousness Consent Problem**
**Situation**: Shadow-touched individuals often lose capacity for rational decision-making. Experimental "shadow surgery" might restore them, but requires informed consent they cannot meaningfully provide.

**Patient Categories**:
- **Complete Transformation**: No apparent human consciousness remaining
- **Partial Awareness**: Intermittent lucidity and communication
- **Altered Perspective**: Fully conscious but with fundamentally different values
- **Pre-emptive Cases**: Healthy individuals at high risk of infection

**Case Study: The Tidewalker Family Crisis**
**Patient**: Marcus Tidewalker, transformed three weeks ago
**Family Position**: Wife demands surgery, claiming pre-illness Marcus would want it
**Current Marcus**: Expresses contentment and fear of surgery
**Medical Team**: Divided on whether current Marcus is competent to refuse

**Ethical Frameworks in Conflict**:
- **Substituted Judgment**: What would pre-transformation Marcus want?
- **Best Interest**: What outcome provides the most benefit?
- **Present Autonomy**: Should current Marcus's wishes be respected?
- **Family Authority**: Do families have rights to make decisions?

**Complicating Factors**:
- Surgery success rates vary from 20-80% depending on transformation depth
- Failed surgeries often leave patients in worse condition
- Some patients report being happier after transformation
- Religious debates about whether shadows are parasites or evolution

### 3. Quarantine Ethics

#### **The Isolation Dilemma**
**Situation**: Containing plague spread requires isolating potentially infected individuals, but quarantine conditions are harsh and some detainees are healthy.

**The Pressure Ward Crisis**
- **Capacity**: 100 beds for 300 potential cases
- **Conditions**: Overcrowded, minimal medical care, high mortality
- **Duration**: Indefinite isolation until symptoms clear or appear
- **Population**: Mix of confirmed cases and suspected exposures

**Moral Questions**:
- Can society imprison healthy individuals to prevent disease?
- What level of care do quarantined individuals deserve?
- Who bears responsibility for deaths in quarantine?
- How certain must infection risk be to justify detention?

**Stakeholder Conflicts**:
- **Public Health Officials**: Prioritizing population protection
- **Civil Rights Advocates**: Defending individual freedoms
- **Families**: Split between safety and being together
- **Medical Staff**: Torn between treatment and containment
- **Economic Interests**: Businesses devastated by quarantine

### 4. Experimental Treatment Ethics

#### **The Desperation Research Protocol**
**Situation**: Traditional treatments prove ineffective. Experimental approaches show promise but carry unknown risks and limited supply.

**The Deep Current Trials**
**Treatment**: Extract from Deep Mother cultists appears to grant immunity
**Risks**: Unknown long-term effects, possible consciousness alteration
**Supply**: Extremely limited, requires cooperation with cult members
**Volunteers**: Desperate families offering to test on loved ones

**Research Ethics Violations**:
- **Inadequate Informed Consent**: Unknown risks cannot be properly disclosed
- **Coercion**: Desperation undermines voluntary participation
- **Selection Bias**: Wealthier families gain access through connections
- **Premature Distribution**: Political pressure to release before safety testing

**The Child Test Subject Dilemma**
- Children show highest recovery rates in trials
- Parents volunteer their sick children
- Ethics boards normally prohibit pediatric testing
- Time pressure prevents proper safety protocols

### 5. Healthcare Worker Protection

#### **The Duty to Treat vs. Self-Preservation**
**Situation**: Medical staff face extremely high infection rates. Some demand protective equipment that doesn't exist or refuse to treat the most contagious cases.

**Professional Obligations vs. Personal Safety**:
- Medical oaths require treating all patients
- Staff have families and personal survival instincts
- Dead healers cannot help future patients
- Community depends on their continued service

**The Healer's Strike**
- 60% of medical staff refuse to work without better protection
- Remaining 40% face impossible caseloads
- Community leaders demand they fulfill professional duties
- Some healers flee the city entirely

**Moral Complexity**:
- Does professional duty require martyrdom?
- Can society compel medical service?
- Who decides acceptable risk levels?
- What obligations do healers have to their own families?

### 6. End-of-Life Decisions

#### **Euthanasia in Crisis**
**Situation**: Pain management supplies are exhausted. Many terminal patients request death rather than suffering through transformation or painful disease progression.

**The Mercy Question**:
- Traditional healing oaths forbid ending life
- Patients clearly suffering with no hope of recovery
- Families torn between prolonging life and ending pain
- Religious authorities provide conflicting guidance

**Case Study: The Deepcurrent Ward**
**Patient**: Elder Coralwise, respected community leader
**Condition**: Terminal plague infection with extreme pain
**Request**: Assisted death to preserve dignity
**Impact**: Community looking to him as example
**Dilemma**: Medical staff divided on honoring request

**Cultural Perspectives**:
- **Deep Faith Tradition**: Life is sacred, suffering has meaning
- **Tide Wisdom**: Natural cycles include death at proper time
- **Scholar's Approach**: Rational calculation of suffering vs. benefit
- **Family Honor**: Dignity in death versus preservation of life

## Implementation Framework for DMs

## DM Notes

Medical ethics scenarios work best when players have established relationships with potential patients. Build toward major medical crises by first presenting smaller ethical choices. Allow players to debate and discuss options thoroughly - the decision-making process is often more important than the final choice. Remember that even trained medical professionals struggle with these dilemmas, so don't expect players to have perfect answers.
