## Overview

Port Meridian Harbor serves as [[Aquabyssos]]'s primary connection to the surface world and other underwater realms, functioning as both a massive commercial hub and a critical strategic chokepoint. The harbor works closely with [[Port Meridian   Market Square]] on the surface and coordinates with [[The Royal Palace]] for diplomatic trade relations. Built into a natural underwater valley where multiple deep-sea currents converge, the harbor takes advantage of these natural forces to create one of the most efficient maritime facilities in any realm.

The harbor operates on multiple levels, with surface vessels anchoring above while specialized underwater craft navigate the deeper channels. Massive crystal formations provide illumination and magical infrastructure, while pressure-controlled docking bays allow for seamless transitions between different aquatic environments.

As political tensions rise in [[Aquabyssos]], Port Meridian has become increasingly important as a source of information, supplies, and potential escape routes, making it a focal point for espionage and smuggling operations connected to [[The Shadow Markets]] and other criminal enterprises.

## Geography

The harbor is carved into the side of a massive underwater cliff face, with docking facilities extending across seven distinct levels. The uppermost level connects to surface anchorages through a series of magical air pockets and pressure locks, while the deepest level provides access to the abyssal currents that connect to distant underwater realms.

Natural coral formations have been carefully cultivated to create breakwaters and navigation aids, while artificially grown crystal gardens provide both lighting and magical energy for the harbor's operations. The main channel is wide enough for three large vessels to pass simultaneously, with smaller tributary channels serving specialized craft.

### Surface Exchange

The topmost level where surface traders conduct business through specialized pressure chambers and magical air bubbles. Features offices for foreign merchants and diplomatic representatives from [[Aethermoor]] and other surface realms.

### Main Commercial Docks

The largest docking facilities handling the majority of trade vessels. Contains warehouses, loading facilities, and the harbor master's headquarters, coordinating with [[Port Meridian   Market Square]] for goods distribution.

### Deep Current Terminal

Specialized facilities for vessels traveling the deep ocean currents to distant realms. Requires special pressure adaptation and magical navigation systems, often used for diplomatic missions to other underwater kingdoms.

### Fishing Quarter

Dedicated to [[Aquabyssos]]'s substantial fishing fleets, with processing facilities and markets for fresh catches, supplying both local consumption and export to [[The Shadow Markets]].

### Restricted Military Zone

Secure docking for naval vessels and sensitive cargo, heavily guarded by [[Depth Wardens]] and requiring special authorization for access.

## Population

Port Meridian hosts a permanent population of approximately 8,000 residents, including dockworkers, customs officials, traders, and their families. However, the transient population can swell to over 15,000 during peak trading seasons, with merchants, sailors, and travelers from dozens of different realms and species.

The population is notably diverse, including tritons, sea elves, merfolk, water genasi, and adapted surface dwellers, as well as exotic traders from distant aquatic realms.

## Economy

The harbor is Aquabyssos's economic heart, handling over 70% of the city's trade volume. Major exports include processed sea minerals, crafted coral goods, magical pearls, and specialized underwater equipment. Imports range from surface-world metals and textiles to exotic goods from distant underwater civilizations.

The harbor generates substantial revenue through docking fees, customs duties, and services provided to visiting vessels. Several major trading houses maintain permanent facilities here, while smaller merchants compete for temporary berth space.

## Government

The harbor operates under the authority of **[[12_Research/D&D_Statblocks/Harbormaster Erik Saltbeard]]**, who reports directly to the city council and coordinates with [[Parliament of Echoes]] on trade policy. Day-to-day operations are managed by a complex bureaucracy including customs officials, dock supervisors, and security forces from [[Depth Wardens]].

Political tensions have resulted in increased security measures and more stringent inspection procedures, though different factions compete to influence harbor policies to their advantage, often involving corruption networks connected to [[The Shadow Markets]].

## History

Port Meridian was established fifty years ago when Aquabyssos evolved from a small settlement to a major city. The natural advantages of the location were recognized early, but developing the complex infrastructure required to handle multi-environment shipping took decades of innovation.

The harbor has survived several major crises, including attacks by deep-sea monsters, diplomatic incidents with surface nations, and natural disasters. Each crisis led to improvements in defenses and procedures, making it one of the most secure and efficient ports in any realm.

## Adventure Hooks

1. A valuable shipment goes missing under suspicious circumstances, requiring investigation into the harbor's complex web of rivalries and corruption involving [[The Shadow Markets]].
2. Strange creatures from the deep currents begin attacking vessels, possibly connected to [[12_Research/D&D_Statblocks/The Void Touched Depths]] or other supernatural threats.
3. The party needs to intercept a secret meeting between faction representatives that's supposedly taking place in the harbor's neutral territory, with implications for [[Parliament of Echoes]] politics.
4. Diplomatic tensions arise when a surface vessel from [[Aethermoor]] is denied docking rights, requiring delicate negotiation.
5. Evidence emerges of smuggling operations moving contraband between the harbor and [[Port Meridian   Market Square]].

## Connections

Port Meridian connects directly to [[Aquabyssos]]'s main transportation network via the pressure tube system, linking to [[Parliament of Echoes]], [[Coral Courts]], and [[The Shadow Markets]]. It also serves as the terminus for several major deep-sea current routes, including connections to other underwater cities, [[Aethermoor]] surface ports via [[Port Meridian   Market Square]], and exotic realms in the deepest oceans. The harbor's communication network links it to diplomatic outposts and trading partners across multiple planes of existence.
