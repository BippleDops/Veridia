# Desperate Plague Victim
*The Human Cost of Cosmic Conflict*

## Overview

[[Mira Shadowtouched]] represents thousands of ordinary citizens throughout both [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] who have been caught in the crossfire of cosmic forces beyond their understanding. A former seamstress from [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven]], Mira contracted a severe case of [[Shadow Corruption]] while caring for infected family members. Now slowly dying from reality sickness, she has become a desperate wanderer seeking any cure, no matter how dangerous or morally compromising.

Her story exemplifies the human tragedy underlying the grand cosmic drama of [[The Convergence Point]]â€”ordinary people suffering extraordinary consequences while powerful forces pursue their own agendas. Mira's desperate search for healing has led her into contact with every major faction and phenomenon in both worlds, making her both a victim and an unwitting catalyst for larger events.

## Background and Personal History

### Before the Corruption
**Life as a Seamstress (Ages 16-34)**
Mira lived a simple but fulfilling life in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven]]'s artisan district:
- **Family Business**: Inherited her mother's tailoring shop specializing in crystal-enhanced fabrics
- **Community Standing**: Respected member of the Seamstress Guild with steady clientele
- **Personal Life**: Married to [[Gareth Brightweave]], a fellow textile worker, with two young children
- **Daily Routine**: Predictable schedule of work, family care, and community participation
- **Simple Dreams**: Hoped to expand the shop, send children to good schools, and enjoy peaceful retirement

**The Happy Family:**
- **Husband Gareth**: Dye specialist creating color-changing fabrics using crystal resonance
- **Daughter Luna** (Age 12): Showing early talent for fabric design and color theory
- **Son Marcus** (Age 9): Energetic boy interested in crystal singing and music
- **Extended Family**: Close relationships with aunts, uncles, and cousins throughout the city
- **Community Connections**: Active in neighborhood watch, children's education, and guild activities

### The Infection Event
**The Shadow Outbreak (18 months ago)**
Mira's life changed forever during a localized [[Shadow Corruption]] outbreak in her district:

**Initial Exposure:**
The corruption spread through the underground crystal networks beneath her shop, manifesting first in the basement storage areas. Mira was exposed while attempting to save infected family members who had taken shelter in her shop during the crisis.

**The Heroic Choice:**
When [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Crystal Guard Elite|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Crystal Guard Elite]] units arrived to quarantine the area, Mira refused evacuation, choosing to stay and care for her infected family members rather than abandon them to certain death. This decision, while noble, led to prolonged exposure that resulted in her own infection.

**Tragic Losses:**
- **Gareth**: Died from rapid corruption progression after three days
- **Luna**: Corruption consumed her artistic abilities before claiming her life
- **Marcus**: Lasted longest due to his crystal affinity, but ultimately succumbed
- **Extended Family**: Lost 12 relatives to the outbreak
- **Community**: Entire district abandoned as too corrupted to save
