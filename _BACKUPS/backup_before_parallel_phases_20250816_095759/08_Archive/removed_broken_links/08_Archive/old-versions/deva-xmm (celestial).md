These immortal messengers adopt the shapes of mystical beasts or idealized, winged mortals. As with all angels, their true forms are known only to the gods they serve. Rather than literal correspondence from a god, a deva conveys an allegory or quest to mortals, tasking them with delivering something to its rightful place. While the angel might be called on in times of need, it encourages mortal heroism. Should a deva's chosen champions carry out their charge, they experience a revelation or the world is changed in line with divine purpose. Roll on or choose a result from the Deva Messages table to inspire a deva's charge. **Deva Messages**`dice: [](deva-xmm.md#^deva-messages)`| dice: `dice: 1d6` | The Deva Tasks a Mortal with Delivering... |

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of deva xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around deva xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Hidden Prophecy of Shadows ## Plot Hooks - Strange disappearances suggest a conspiracy
