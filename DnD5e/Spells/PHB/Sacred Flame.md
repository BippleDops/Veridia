# Sacred Flame
Flame-like radiance descends on a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `dice: 1d8|avg` (1d8) radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this saving throw.

The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (`dice: 2d8|avg` (2d8)), 11th level (`dice: 3d8|avg` (3d8)), and 17th level (`dice: 4d8|avg` (4d8)).
