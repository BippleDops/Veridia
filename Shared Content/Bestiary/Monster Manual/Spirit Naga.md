## Special Traits
***Spellcasting.*** The naga is a 10th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks), and it needs only verbal components to cast its spells. It has the following wizard spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): *mage hand, minor illusion, ray of frost*
1st level (4 slots): *charm person, detect magic, sleep*
2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts, hold person*
3rd level (3 slots): *lightning bolt, water breathing*
4th level (3 slots): *blight, dimension door*
5th level (2 slots): *dominate person*

***Rejuvenation.*** If it dies, the naga returns to life in `dice: 1d6` days and regains all its hit points. Only a wish spell can prevent this trait from functioning.

## Actions
***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d6+4`) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 31 (`dice: 7d8`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Description
Spirit nagas live in gloom and spitefulness, constantly plotting vengeance against creatures that have wronged them-or that they believe have wronged them. Lairing in dismal caverns and ruins, they devote their time to developing new spells and enslaving the mortals with which they surround themselves. A spirit naga likes to charm its foes, drawing them close so that it can sink its poisonous fangs into their flesh.
