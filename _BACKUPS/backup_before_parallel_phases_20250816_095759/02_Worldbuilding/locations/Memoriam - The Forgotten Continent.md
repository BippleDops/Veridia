## Overview

Memoriam is a continental paradox—a landmass the size of [Abyssos Prime]] that everyone forgets exists the moment they stop directly observing it. Civilizations have risen and fallen here, leaving behind ruins no one remembers building. [[maps show empty ocean where Memoriam sits, yet ships that sail through it arrive at their destinations with missing time and confused crews.

### The Forgetting Field

A reality-warping field that prevents memory formation about anything within or related to Memoriam:
- **Immediate**: Forget details within seconds of looking away
- **Short-term**: Forget you were here within minutes of leaving
- **Long-term**: Evidence of visits erases itself from reality
- **Permanent**: [People]] who die here are forgotten by everyone

**Mechanical Effects**:
- Cannot use INT-based skills effectively (always [[Disadvantage)
- Must make **DC 18** WIS save to remember anything after 1 minute
- Written notes about Memoriam fade unless continuously observed
- Photographs and drawings become blank
- Maps refuse to show its location

### Persistence Techniques

Methods discovered (and rediscovered) to maintain some awareness:
- **Pain Anchoring**: Self-inflicted wounds help maintain memories briefly
- **Emotional Binding**: Traumatic or ecstatic experiences last longer
- **Paradox Loops**: Creating logical impossibilities that can't be forgotten
- **The Forgetting of Forgetting**: Forgetting that you forget sometimes works

### The Uncertain City

A massive metropolis that may or may not exist. Buildings phase in and out of reality based on observation. Streets lead to different destinations each time they're walked.

**Notable Uncertain Locations**:
- **The Library of Unwritten Books**: Contains every book that was never written
- **The Museum of Neverwas**: Exhibits artifacts from histories that didn't happen
- **The Parliament of Nobody**: Elected officials who don't exist govern people who forget they live here

### The Recursive Shores

Beaches where the same wave breaks eternally because the ocean forgets it already crashed. Footprints appear before they're made and disappear while being observed.

### The Interior Void

The continent's center is a perfect nothing—not empty space, but the absence of space itself. Travelers who enter emerge from random edges with no time having passed, but aged years.

### The Unremembered Citizens

People live here, evidenced by warm meals in empty houses and maintained infrastructure. But they can't remember themselves, existing in a constant state of meeting everyone for the first time, including themselves in mirrors.

**Daily Life Cycles**:
- Wake up with no memory of who they are
- Find evidence of their life (photos, journals, clothes that fit)
- Spend the day rediscovering their existence
- Go to sleep and reset completely

### The Memory Thieves

Entities that exist by stealing memories from visitors, the only way they can maintain coherent existence. They appear as hollow-eyed humans who speak in borrowed experiences.

**[Memory Thief]]** (CR 8)
- AC: 16 (uncertainty field)
- HP: 95 (`dice: `dice: 11d8``+44)
- **Memory Drain**: Touch steals `dice: `dice: 1d6`` memories (specific events chosen by DM)
- **Identity Theft**: Can perfectly mimic anyone whose memories they've stolen
- **Antimemetic Cloak**: Automatically forgotten if not actively observed

### The Persistent Ones

Rare individuals who somehow remember Memoriam exists. They're cursed with being the only ones who know about an entire continent, dismissed as delusional by everyone else.

**The Curse of Knowing**:
- Can never convince others Memoriam exists
- Evidence they gather disappears
- Journals self-censor mentions of the continent
- Eventually doubt their own memories

### The Impossible Trade

Ships arrive at ports with cargo they don't remember loading, payment for goods they don't recall selling. Memoriam's economy functions through unconscious transactions.

**Trade Goods That Don't Exist**:
- **Forgotten Pearls**: Valuable but no one remembers why
- **Void Glass**: Windows to nowhere
- **Uncertainty Ore**: Metal that might be there
- **Never-fruit**: Nourishing food that was never grown

### The Bank of Unrecorded Wealth

A ficial institution that manages accounts no one remembers opening, paying interest on deposits that were never made, funding ventures that won't be remembered.

### Memory Storms

Violent tempests of concentrated forgetting that can erase people from history:
- **Stage 1**: Forget why you came here
- **Stage 2**: Forget who you came with
- **Stage 3**: Forget your own name
- **Stage 4**: Forget you exist
- **Stage 5**: Never existed at all

### Paradox Zones

Areas where the antimemetic field conflicts with reality:
- [[Places that are remembered but don't exist
- Events that happened but never occurred
- People who are present but were never born
- Conversations happening in reverse causality

### "The Persistent Map"

A map that shows Memoriam has appeared, resisting the antimemetic field. Following it leads to the source of the forgetting—and possibly a way to end it.

### "The Remembered Child"

A child from Memoriam somehow exists in regular memory. Everyone remembers them, but they remember nothing. They might be the key to understanding the continent.

### "The Accumulating Evidence"

[The Party]] keeps finding evidence of previous visits to Memoriam they don't remember. Journal entries in their handwriting, contracts they signed, even scars from battles they never fought.

### The Origin of Forgetting

Memoriam was deliberately forgotten to contain something. Theories include:
- A god that should not be worshipped
- The true history of [[The Drowning
- A plague of pure information
- The location of the Depth Mother's heart

### The Memory Sink Theory

Memoriam might be where all forgotten things go—every lost memory, abandoned thought, and discarded identity accumulates here, creating a massive psychic landfill.

### The Protection Protocol

Perhaps Memoriam forgets visitors to protect them. Those who fully remember the continent go catastrophically insane from knowledge they weren't meant to have.

### The Parliament of Shadows

Several Shadow [Senator]]s come from Memoriam, explaining why no one remembers electing them. They're trying to make the rest of [[Aquabyssos forgettable too.

### [The Memory Wars]]

Memoriam is the ultimate weapon—an entire continent that can be strategically forgotten and remembered to reshape history.

### Connection to [[Aethermoor

The eighth shard, the one no one remembers, is hidden in Memoriam. It's the Shard of Forgetting, and it's been actively erasing itself from the prophecy.

### [Key Locations]]
1. Main entrance/approach
2. Central gathering area
3. Important buildings/features
4. Defensive positions (if applicable)
5. Hidden or secret areas

### The Ultimate Mystery

The truth about Memoriam should remain uncertain. Even the DM shouldn't be entirely sure what's real there. Is it:
- A collective hallucination?
- A reality-wide glitch?
- A divine punishment?
- A protective measure?
- All simultaneously true?

*"This journal entry is the only proof I have that Memoriam exists. By the time you read this, you'll have forgotten where you found it. By the time I reread it, I'll have forgotten I wrote it. But somewhere, nowhere, and everywhere, an entire continent of people lives, dies, and forgets, and forgetting, forgets to forget."*
