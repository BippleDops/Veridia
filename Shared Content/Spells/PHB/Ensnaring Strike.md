# Ensnaring Strike
The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, a writhing mass of thorny vines appears at the point of impact, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be [[restrained]] by the magical vines until the spell ends. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw. If the target succeeds on the save, the vines shrivel away.

While [[restrained]] by this spell, the target takes `dice: 1d6|avg` (1d6) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature [[restrained]] by the vines or one that can touch the creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is freed.


If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
