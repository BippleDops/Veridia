Benthia is one of the [[The Deep Mother|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother's Pressure Angels—divine beings born from the intersection of the goddess's will and the crushing depths of the ocean. She serves as guardian of critical pressure points where the Deep Mother's influence is strongest, manifesting as both protector and test for those who would approach the deepest mysteries. Unlike mortal servants, she is pure divine force given form, embodying the Deep Mother's power over pressure, depth, and the weight of existence itself. ## Adventure Hooks

3. **The Sacred Guardian**: Negotiate passage to protected divine sites

When she takes damage, she can use her reaction to shift focus to another manifestation, negating the damage. **Pressure Mastery.** Benthia can manipulate pressure within 1 mile. She can create zones of crushing depth or perfect buoyancy at will, and all creatures in water within this range are subject to her pressure effects. **Deep Mother's Authority.** Creatures that serve [[The Deep Mother automatically succeed on saving throws against Benthia's abilities and gain advantage on all rolls when acting in accordance with divine will. **Depth Immunity.** Benthia is immune to all pressure-related damage and effects. She can exist comfortably at any depth, including the deepest ocean trenches. **Spellcasting.** Benthia is a 20th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save **DC 23**, +15 to hit with spell attacks). She knows the following spells: - **Cantrips (at will):** guidance, mending, prestidigitation, sacred flame, thaumaturgy

- **1st level (4 slots):** command, detect magic, sanctuary
- **2nd level (3 slots):** calm emotions, detect thoughts, silence, zone of truth
- **3rd level (3 slots):** dispel magic, mass healing word, water breathing
- **4th level (3 slots):** control water, divination, freedom of movement
- **5th level (3 slots):** commune, dispel evil and good, mass cure wounds, scrying
- **6th level (2 slots):** heal, planar ally, word of recall
- **7th level (1 slot):** divine word, plane shift
- **8th level (1 slot):** antimagic field, earthquake (pressure-based)
- **9th level (1 slot):** gate, mass heal ### Actions **Multiattack.** Benthia can cast a spell and use one of her pressure abilities, or use three pressure abilities. **Crushing Depth.** Benthia targets up to 3 creatures within 120 feet. Each target must make a **DC 23** Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 45 (`dice: 10d8`) force damage and are restrained by immense pressure for 1 minute. On a success, they take half damage and are not restrained. Restrained creatures can repeat the saving throw at the end of their turn. **Divine Pressure Touch.** *Melee Spell Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 22 (`dice: 4d6` + 8) force damage plus 18 (`dice: 4d8`) radiant damage. The target must succeed on a **DC 23** Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to speak only truth for 24 hours. **Pressure Healing (3/Day).** Benthia applies precisely controlled pressure to heal wounds. She touches a creature and they regain 70 (`dice: 12d10` + 4) hit points. This healing also removes one disease, curse, or other harmful condition. **Weight of Truth (Recharge 5-6).** All creatures within 60 feet must make a **DC 23** Wisdom saving throw. Those who fail are compelled to confess their deepest secret or most significant lie. They take 36 (`dice: 8d8`) psychic damage and are stunned for 1 round. Those who succeed take half damage and are not stunned. **Divine Judgment (1/Day).** Benthia pronounces judgment on up to 6 creatures within 120 feet. Each target must make a **DC 23** Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they are marked by divine pressure. For the next 24 hours, if they act against [The Deep Mother]]'s will or lie about their intentions, they automatically take 27 (`dice: 6d8`) radiant damage and are knocked prone. ### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)

Benthia can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. **Move.** Benthia moves up to her swim speed without provoking opportunity attacks. **Pressure Manipulation.** Benthia uses her Pressure Mastery to create a zone of difficult terrain or to lift willing creatures to safety. **Divine Insight.** Benthia casts a divination spell of 3rd level or lower, or uses her Divine Manifestation ability. **Pressure Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** Benthia uses Crushing Depth or makes a Divine Pressure Touch attack. ### Mythic Actions

If Benthia is encountered at a major pressure nexus point during a moment of cosmic significance, she gains mythic actions that can be used when she's first reduced to half her hit points. **Deep Mother's Awakening.** The water within 1 mile becomes an extension of Benthia's will. She regains half her hit points and can manifest simultaneously at all pressure points within this area. **Cosmic Trial (Mythic Action).** Benthia subjects all creatures within 240 feet to a trial by pressure. Each creature must make a **DC 25** Constitution, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw (their choice). The trial reveals their true nature and worthiness, granting divine boons to the worthy and divine punishment to the unworthy. --- ### Pressure Angel Origins
