# Memory Read (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *divination*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 10 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a small piece of linen cloth woven with a few threads of gold, worth at least 10 gp)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
You may read the memory of a single target that you can see within range. You experience the memory in far less time—one hour of memory takes you only one round to experience—but with full intensity. The target experiences the speeded-up memory at the same time as you do.

An unwilling target may make a Wisdom saving throw. If the target is deliberately trying to keep that memory a secret or suppress it, it gets advantage on the saving throw.

Casting this spell causes you mental drain. You must make an Intelligence saving throw (DC equals 10 + the target’s Wisdom modifier) or take 2d6 psychic damage.
