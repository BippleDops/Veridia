## Lore Details

Legends speak of Location 1 2 as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Location 1 2.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Location 1 2 to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
