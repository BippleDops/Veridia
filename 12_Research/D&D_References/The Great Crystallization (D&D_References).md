## The Event

On the 17th day of Highsummer, exactly 500 years ago, the world of [[Aethermoor|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] changed forever. At the moment of solar eclipse, seven massive crystal spires erupted from the earth simultaneously across the continent. The sky itself seemed to shatter, raining down crystal fragments that embedded themselves in the ground, growing into the Aether Crystal formations we know today.

### Eyewitness Accounts
*"The sun went dark, and for a moment, there was perfect silence. Then came the soundâ€”like all the glass in the world breaking at once. The earth split open, and towers of light burst forth, reaching toward the heavens."* - Chronicle of Brother Benedict

*"I saw the Crown break. Seven lights fleeing in seven directions, piercing the earth where they fell. And the god-king screaming as he fell from the heavens."* - The Mad Prophet's Testament

### Primary Eruption Sites
1. **The Northern Spire** - Now center of [[The Crystalline Wastes|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Crystalline Wastes]]
2. **The Eastern Spire** - Heart of [[The Sundered Peaks|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Sundered Peaks]]
3. **The Southern Spire** - Deep in [[The Verdant Reach|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Verdant Reach]]
4. **The Western Spire** - Beneath the waves of [[The Azure Coast]]
5. **The Central Spire** - Where [[Crystalhaven|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven]] was built
6. **The Desert Spire** - Center of [[The Whispering Expanse]]
7. **The Shadow Spire** - Lost in [[The Shadowmere|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Shadowmere]]

### The Crystal Types
Each spire produced different crystal variants:
- **Clear**: Pure energy (Central)
- **Red**: Physical enhancement (Northern)
- **Blue**: Mental amplification (Eastern)
- **Green**: Natural harmony (Southern)
- **Azure**: Emotional manipulation (Western)
- **Gold**: Divine connection (Desert)
- **Black**: Death and shadow (Shadow)

### The Orthodox View
The [[Purist Coalition|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/Purist Coalition]] teaches that mortal hubris brought divine punishment. The God-King Aetheron's pride grew too great, and the heavens struck him down, shattering his crown and cursing the land with crystalline corruption.

### The Progressive Theory
[[The Crystal Throne|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/The Crystal Throne]] scholars believe it was a natural magical phenomenon, possibly triggered by an alignment of ley lines or a surge from another plane. The crystals are a resource to be understood and harnessed.

### The Heretical Truth
> [!warning] DM Only - The Real Story
> God-King Aetheron was betrayed by his seven most trusted advisors, each representing a different aspect of mortal ambition. They attempted to steal his Crown of Stars to claim divinity for themselves. In the struggle, the crown shattered, its seven shards piercing the earth. Aetheron fell but did not die, becoming [[The Crimson Sage|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]].

## The Seven Betrayers
> [!warning] DM Only - Secret History
> 1. **Marcus the Just** - Wanted perfect order (ancestor of [[High Inquisitor Maltheos|02 Worldbuilding/People/High Inquisitor Maltheos]])
> 2. **Seraphina the Beautiful** - Craved eternal youth (ancestor of the Lumengarde line)
> 3. **Goldwin the Merchant** - Desired infinite wealth (ancestor of [[Lord Aurelius Goldwave]])
> 4. **Shadowthorn the Assassin** - Sought ultimate power over death
> 5. **Thornweaver the Druid** - Wished to become one with nature
> 6. **Stormwind the Navigator** - Yearned to control the elements
> 7. **The Nameless Scholar** - Pursued forbidden knowledge

### The Crystal Wars (Years 2-50)
Various factions fought for control of crystal sites. Entire kingdoms rose and fell based on crystal access. The period ended with the Treaty of Lumengarde, establishing current borders.

### The Adaptation (Years 51-200)
Society rebuilt around crystal technology. The first Crystal Wardens were established. Trade routes developed for crystal commerce. The corruption problem was partially understood.

### The Modern Era (Years 201-500)
Current political structures solidified. The balance between progress and corruption became the central tension. Recent acceleration of corruption suggests something is changing.

### Uswered Questions
1. Why did it happen on that specific day?
2. Are the crystals spreading or stabilizing?
3. Can the process be reversed?
4. What happened to Aetheron's body?
5. Where is the Seventh Shard?

## The Prophecy of Restoration
*"Seven shards scattered, seven sins paid,*
*When the crown is whole, the debt is made,*
*The god shall rise or fall complete,*
*And mortals' fate lie at his feet."*

### Can It Happen Again?
Some scholars fear a Second Crystallization. Evidence includes:
- Increasing crystal resoce
- Planar boundaries weakening
- Corruption acceleration
- Strange behavior of existing spires

### The Purpose Question
Was the Crystallization:
- Punishment for sin?
- Natural evolution?
- Invasion from another plane?
- Failed ascension to godhood?
- Deliberate transformation?

## DM Guidance
The Great Crystallization is the defining event of the campaign world. Its true nature should be revealed gradually. Different factions have different interpretations, all partially correct. The event's full truth ties directly to the campaign's ultimate resolution.

## Player-Facing Summary

The Great Crystallization is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of The Great Crystallization as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around The Great Crystallization.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.

## Plot Hooks

- Strange sightings suggest a curse
- Someone is protecting a artifact for revenge
- A map reveals a conspiracy about the government
