# Heal
Choose a creature that you can see within range. A surge of positive energy washes through the creature, causing it to regain 70 hit points. This spell also ends [[blinded||blindness]], [[deafened||deafness]], and any diseases affecting the target. This spell has no effect on constructs or undead.


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the amount of healing increases by 10 for each slot level above 6th.
