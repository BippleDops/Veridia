--- # Crossbow Expert

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 203* **Prerequisite**: 4th; Dexterity 13 or higher You gain the following benefits. **Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20. **Ignore Loading.** You ignore the Loading property of the Hand Crossbow, Heavy Crossbow, and Light Crossbow (all called crossbows elsewhere in this feat). If you're holding one of them, you can load a piece of ammunition into it even if you lack a free hand. **Firing in Melee.** Being within 5 feet of an enemy doesn't impose Disadvantage on your attack rolls with crossbows. **Dual Wielding.** When you make the extra attack of the Light property, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the extra attack if that attack is with a crossbow that has the Light property and you aren't already adding that modifier to the damage. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Crossbow expert xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
