--- # Find Familiar

*1st-level, Conjuration (ritual)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/find-familiar.webp#right) - **Casting time:** 1 hour unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (burning incense worth 10+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose: [[Giant Bat Xmm]], [[cat-xmm (beast)]], [[frog-xmm (beast)]], [[Blood Hawk Xmm]], [[lizard-xmm (beast)]], [[Giant Octopus Xmm]], [[Giant Owl Xmm]], [[Wererat Xmm]], [[Raven Xmm]], [[phase-spider-xmm (monstrosity)]], [[giant-weasel-xmm (beast)]], or another Beast that has a Challenge Rating of 0. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though it is a Celestial, Fey, or Fiend (your choice) instead of a Beast. Your familiar acts independently of you, but it obeys your commands. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Telepathic Connection While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. Additionally, as a [[Action Xphb]], you can see through the familiar's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, gaining the benefits of any special senses it has. Finally, when you cast a spell with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the touch. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must take a [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules)]] to deliver the touch when you cast the spell. ## Combat The familiar is an ally to you and your allies. It rolls its own [[Initiative Xphb]] and acts on its own turn. A familiar can't attack, but it can take other actions as normal. ## Disappearance of the Familiar When the familiar drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]], it disappears. It reappears after you cast this spell again. As a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you can temporarily dismiss the familiar to a pocket dimension. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. Whenever the familiar drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] or disappears into the pocket dimension, it leaves behind in its space anything it was wearing or carrying. ## One Familiar Only You can't have more than one familiar at a time. If you cast this spell while you have a familiar, you instead cause it to adopt a new eligible form. ## Summary **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 272. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* ## Player-Facing Summary Find familiar xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of find familiar xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around find familiar xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[Master_Spell_Compendium]]
