# Illithilich

## Lair actions
_Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the illithilich can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the illithilich can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- The illithilich rolls a `d8` and regains a spell slot of that level or lower. If it has no spent spell slots of that level or lower, nothing happens.  
- The illithilich targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. A crackling cord of negative energy tethers the illithilich to the target. Whenever the illithilich takes damage, the target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the illithilich takes half the damage (rounded down), and the target takes the remaining damage. This tether lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round or until the illithilich or the target is no longer in the illithilich's lair.  
- The illithilich calls forth the spirits of creatures that died in its lair. These apparitions materialize and attack one creature that the illithilich can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (`15d6`) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. The apparitions then disappear.
