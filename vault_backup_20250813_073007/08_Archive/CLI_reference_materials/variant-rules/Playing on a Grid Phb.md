# Playing on a Grid
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 192* 

If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules.

## Squares

Each square on the grid represents 5 feet.

## Speed

Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your speed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For example, a speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.

If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in squares on your character sheet.

## Entering a Square

To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square of movement left, even if the square is diagonally adjacent to the square you're in. (The rule for diagonal movement sacrifices realism for the sake of smooth play. The Dungeon Master's Guide provides guidance on using a more realistic approach.)

If a square costs extra movement, as a square of difficult terrain does, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must have at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of difficult terrain.

## Corners

Diagonal movement can't cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other terrain feature that fills its space.

## Ranges

To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or objects—start counting squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.

## Player-Facing Summary

Playing on a grid phb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of playing on a grid phb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around playing on a grid phb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties playing on a grid phb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at playing on a grid phb to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to playing on a grid phb active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
