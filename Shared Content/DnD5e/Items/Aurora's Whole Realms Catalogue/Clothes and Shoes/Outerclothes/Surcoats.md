## Description
When nothing short or a heavy duty [[Cote|cote]] will do, Aurora’s selection of surcoats is the place to shop. A regular linen surcoat can be had for 6 sp, or quilted for extra warmth for 2 gp. If you plan to travel to arctic lands, our specially crafted peltcote is a must. Made of not one, but two layers of quilted wool, this surcoat is durable and warm. It is fur-lined, hooded, and reaches to below the knees. We’re the only ones to offer ours with a special belt for tools and lined pockets with hasps. All of this for only 20 gp.

## Additional Details
peltcote actually offers a + 1 to AC, but effectively reduces Dexterity by 4.
