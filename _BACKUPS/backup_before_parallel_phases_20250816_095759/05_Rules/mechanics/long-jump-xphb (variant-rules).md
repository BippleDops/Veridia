--- # Long Jump

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 370. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* When you make a Long Jump, you leap horizontally a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet immediately before the jump. When you make a standing Long Jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you jump costs a foot of movement. If you land in [[Difficult Terrain Xphb, you must succeed on a **DC 10** Dexterity ([skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]) check or have the [[conditions#prone|Prone condition. This Long Jump rule assumes that the height of the jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your DM's option, you must succeed on a **DC 10** Strength ([skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit the obstacle. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Long jump xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
