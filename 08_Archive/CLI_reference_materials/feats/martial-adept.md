# Martial Adept
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 168*  

You have martial training that allows you to perform special combat maneuvers. You gain the following benefits:

- You learn two [maneuvers](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-optfeaturetype-mv-b.md) of your choice from among those available to the [Battle Master](/03_Mechanics/CLI/classes/fighter-xphb-battle-master-xphb.md) archetype in the fighter class. If a maneuver you use requires your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects, the saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice).  
- You gain one superiority die, which is a `d6` (this die is added to any superiority dice you have from another source). This die is used to fuel your maneuvers. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

## Player-Facing Summary

Martial adept is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of martial adept as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around martial adept.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties martial adept to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at martial adept to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to martial adept active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
