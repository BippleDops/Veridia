```encounter
name: Encounter

*The semi-transparent brume has the appearance of a humanoid wrapped in a soggy funeral shroud. Long claws extend from the arms of the shroud. When its hood is thrown back, a noseless, earless face filled with needlelike fangs and sunken black eye-sockets that glow with two wicked golden points of light is revealed. The creature has no apparent legs, but instead hovers inches above the ground on its “feet” that are nothing more than foul, swirling vapors.*

## Special Traits
**Incorporeal:** A brume can move through solid objects and living creatures at half-speed. If it ends its turn inside another object or creature, it takes 5 (`dice: 1d10`) force damage. This damage is not reduced by the brume's resistance to nonmagical damage.

**Lifesense:** A brume can automatically pinpoint the location of any living creature within 120 feet, and it knows how close to death the creature is.

**Memory Loss:** A living creature struck by a brume's claw attack must make a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw. Failure indicates the creature is affected as if by a confusion spell for `dice: 1d4` hours and it forgets everything that happened in the preceding `dice: 1d6` hours. If the target is a spellcaster, he or she also loses spell slots equal in value to the sum of those two die rolls (`dice: d4+d6`). The spell slots are treated exactly as if they'd been used to cast spells already. The largest spell slots possible must be lost; e.g., a 6th-level wizard who forgets five spell slots must lose a 3rd-level slot (the largest possible) and a 2nd-level slot (to reach five slots lost). The confusion effect can be removed with a dispel magic spell, but the memories of the last few hours are gone forever. Lost spell slots are recovered normally through rest.

**Natural Invisibility:** A brume is always invisible in fog, smoke, or mist. It can't become visible in such an environment.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The brume attacks twice with claws.

**Claws:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d8+3`) slashing damage and the target must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or lose one point of Charisma. The target is also subject to memory loss (see above).

**Misty Surroundings (Recharge 6):** The brume can create an area of fog around itself as if it cast the fog cloud spell. It does not need to concentrate to maintain the fog. The fog cloud has a radius of 40 feet.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
These strange creatures of extraplanar origin dwell within the mists of the Styx, where they are known to strangle the life from any living creatures that find themselves lost there. Brumes track and observe enemies that enter their territory before attacking them, seeking to steal personal effects from the intruders to gain information about their strengths and weaknesses.

Brumes are effectively invisible in fog and they can generate their own fog banks, making them almost impossible to spot.

They feed off the energy of lost souls, devouring the dead of Styx as readily as they do the living, absorbing whatever energy remains in their victims and leaving a dried husk in their wake.

Occasionally brumes find their way into the material plane, where they lurk near planar conduits and crossing points that lead into the Styx. Brumes have been bribed to act as guides into Styx, but they usually demand some form of living sacrifice in return for this service. Brumes are believed to understand several languages, but they are not known to speak.

A brume always attacks at the time and place of its choosing; between their fog and their ability to move through solid obstructions, brumes are essentially impossible to force into combat. They strike from the mist, attempting to throw their enemies into confusion and set them to fighting each other before picking them off in isolation. They have been known to track a large group of intruders over great distance, until such time as they could strike at just a few separated from the main group. They’ve also been known to strike at isolated individuals, stripping their memories and then letting them wander back amongst their friends, who they attack in their confusion.

A brume’s claws are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunities.
