## Overview

The Shadow Market Canals represent one of Aquabyssos's most sophisticated criminal enterprises - a vast network of hidden waterways that serve as both transportation system and trading floor for the city's underground economy. These forgotten channels, originally built as emergency drainage and waste management systems, have been transformed into a thriving black market complex that operates entirely beneath the notice of official authorities.

Spanning over thirty miles of interconnected tunnels, the canal system provides discrete transportation between key criminal facilities while hosting [[Floating Markets, mobile meeting rooms, and secure storage facilities. The constant flow of water masks conversations and movements, while the maze-like layout confuses outsiders and provides numerous escape routes for those who know the secret passages.

### The Five Districts

**The Intake Terminus**
The primary entry point where the canal system connects to legitimate waterways. Heavily guarded and monitored, this area serves as both customs checkpoint and first line of defense.

**The Trading Current**
The busiest section, featuring floating platforms and mobile stalls where most commerce takes place. Water depth varies from 8-15 feet, allowing both swimming and boat-based navigation.

**The Deep Storage**
Lower level channels with reinforced walls and secure docking points for storing valuable or dangerous contraband. Water here is nearly motionless, creating perfect conditions for long-term storage.

**The Crossroads**
Central hub where five major channels converge, featuring the largest permanent structures and serving as the de facto government center for canal operations.

**The Escape Routes**
Narrow, winding channels designed for emergency evacuation, connecting to natural cave systems and abandoned city infrastructure.
