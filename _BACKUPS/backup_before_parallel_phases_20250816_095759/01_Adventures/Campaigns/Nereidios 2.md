# Nereidios - The Scholar's Grave

> *"Knowledge itself became sentient and predatory. Books swim through the streets like schools of fish, and reading the wrong text can rewrite your memories."*

## Overview

A vast library-city where the boundary between knowledge and reality has dissolved. The continent exists as much in thought as in physical space. Buildings are constructed from crystallized ideas, streets flow like streams of consciousness, and the very air carries whispers of forbidden knowledge.

## Key Locations

### The Infinite Archive
- **Description**: Library existing in parallel dimensions simultaneously
- **Danger**: Books that read their readers
- **Notable Features**:
  - The Fiction Sanctum (stories that write reality)
  - The Paradox Collection (texts that shouldn't exist)
  - The Censored Stacks (knowledge made physically dangerous)
- **Inhabitants**: Librarians who exist across multiple timelines

### Thought Pools Complex
- **The Wisdom Wells**: Concentrated liquid knowledge
- **The Confusion Cascades**: Waterfalls of bewilderment
- **The Clarity Chambers**: Where thoughts become crystal
- **Effect**: Drinking grants knowledge but drowns ignorance

### The Syntax Spires
- **Description**: Towers built from crystallized languages
- **Purpose**: Translate between reality and concept
- **Danger**: Speaking the wrong word reshapes surroundings
- **Inhabitants**: The Grammar Guards (enforce linguistic law)

### Memory Moth Gardens
- **Description**: Creatures that feed on and trade memories
- **Economy**: Memories as currency
- **Danger**: Can accidentally sell crucial memories
- **Opportunity**: Can purchase others' experiences

## Government: The Cognition Collective

A hive mind of preserved brains in jars, connected by neural fluid flowing through the city's aqueducts. Each brain retains its personality but shares processing power with the collective.

### Leadership Structure
- **The Prime Cognition**: Oldest brain, coordinates thoughts
- **Memory Council**: Manages information flow
- **Logic Lords**: Enforce rational thought laws
- **Dream Weavers**: Handle creative/irrational aspects

## Inhabitants

### Native Population
- **Scholar-Wraiths**: Academics who studied themselves out of physical existence
- **Living Books**: Texts that achieved consciousness
- **Thought-Forms**: Ideas given physical shape
- **Memory Merchants**: Trade in experiences and knowledge

### Notable NPCs

#### The Mothkeeper Sylantha
- **Nature**: Living story aware of her fictional nature
- **Location**: The Meta-Library
- **Knowledge**: Can see "plot threads" of reality
- **Services**: Narrative consultation, story editing

#### Sage Lysander Deepthought
- **Role**: Last physical librarian
- **Curse**: Remembers everything ever written
- **Location**: The Index Tower
- **Quest Hook**: Seeks the Book of Forgetting

## The Dark Secret

The scholars discovered their reality is itself being written. The Infinite Archive contains books that describe everything happening in Aquabyssos in real-time, and editing these books changes reality. A secret war rages between those trying to write better endings and those trying to preserve the narrative.

## Environmental Hazards

### Knowledge Overflow
- **Effect**: INT save **DC 15** or gain random useless knowledge
- **Frequency**: Every hour in populated areas
- **Cure**: Meditation or memory purge

### Paradox Zones
- **Effect**: Logic breaks down, impossible things happen
- **Navigation**: Requires embracing contradiction
- **Danger**: Can unmake things that shouldn't exist

### Thought Storms
- **Description**: Violent conflicts between incompatible ideas
- **Effect**: Psychic damage and confusion
- **Protection**: Mental shields or ignorance

## Resources & Trade

### Exports
- Liquid knowledge (bottled learning)
- Crystallized languages (instant translation)
- Memory recordings
- Paradox fragments (reality manipulation)

### Imports
- New experiences (raw material for knowledge)
- Blank books (desperately needed)
- Ignorance (surprisingly valuable)
- Physical food (often forgotten necessity)

## Adventure Hooks

1. **The Unwritten Book**: A blank book appears that erases anything written in it from existence
2. **Memory Plague**: Citizens losing memories that never existed
3. **The Author Search**: Faction seeking the one writing their reality
4. **Paradox Prison**: Rescue someone trapped between existing and not
5. **The Final Chapter**: Someone's trying to write "The End" for Aquabyssos

## Connections to Other Continents

- **[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Crystallium**: Share the Resonance Network for data transfer
- **[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Abyssos Prime]]**: Provide intelligence services to the Parliament
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Memoriam**: Secret tunnel through forgotten knowledge
- **[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Vorthak]]**: Exchange temporal paradoxes for probability studies

## Notable Quotes

> *"In Nereidios, forgetting is a luxury we can't afford, and remembering is a curse we can't escape."* - The Mothkeeper

> *"We discovered the truth: every book is true somewhere, every story is real to someone, and every ending is just another beginning we haven't read yet."* - Unknown Scholar

## DM Notes

- Emphasize the horror of too much knowledge
- Play with meta-narrative elements
- NPCs might know they're in a game
- Information itself can be an enemy
- The city literally runs on thoughts

### Random Encounters (d6)
1. Aggressive autobiography trying to rewrite passersby
2. Swarm of punctuation marks escaped from grammar prison
3. Memory merchant offering suspicious deals
4. Thought-form of someone's nightmare
5. Paradox zone where effect precedes cause
6. Living equation seeking solution
