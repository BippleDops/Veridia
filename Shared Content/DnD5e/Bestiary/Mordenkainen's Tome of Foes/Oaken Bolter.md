## Special Traits
***Magic Resistance.*** The oaken bolter has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The oaken bolter makes two lancing bolt attacks or one lancing bolt attack and one harpoon attack.

***Lancing Bolt.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 15 ( `dice: 2d10+4`) piercing damage.

***Harpoon.** Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 50/200 ft., one target. Hit: 9 ( `dice: 1d10+4`) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 12). While grappled in this way, a creature's speed isn't reduced, but it can move only in directions that bring it closer to the oaken bolter. A creature takes 5 ( `dice: 1d10`) slashing damage if it escapes from the grapple or if it tries and fails. As a bonus action, the oaken bolter can pull a creature grappled by it 20 feet closer. The oaken bolter can grapple only one creature at a time.

***Explosive Bolt (Recharge 5-6).*** The oaken bolter launches an explosive charge at a point within 120 feet. Each creature within 20 feet of that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 ( `dice: 5d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Description
No ordinary ballista, an oaken bolter is a construct capable of striking at long distances. The bolts it launches can rend flesh, destroy armor, or drag enemies toward traps or melee-oriented clockworksâ€”and at shorter ranges, burst with explosive force.
