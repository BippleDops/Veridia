## Description
This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can use an action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:

-  The first command word causes the gem to shed [[9 - The Environment|bright light]] in a 30-foot radius and [[9 - The Environment|dim light]] for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn’t expend a charge. It lasts until you use a [[12 - The Order of Combat|bonus action]] to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.

-  The second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of [[9 - The Environment|light]] at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15 [[Constitution|Constitution]] saving throw or become [[Blinded|blinded]] for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

- The third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding [[9 - The Environment|light]] in a 30-foot [[2 - Casting a Spell|cone]] originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.

When all of the gem’s charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.
