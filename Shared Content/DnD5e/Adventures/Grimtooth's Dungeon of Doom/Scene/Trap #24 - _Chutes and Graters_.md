# Trap #24 - "Chutes and Graters"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> As hard as it may be to believe there are those who will find a way past the Drain Trap, but that's 0. K: because good old Evinrood believes in overkill. (That's one of the things I like about the old fossil.)
> 
> Across from the passage that led the party into the last trap there is a low-roofed tunnel that exits the drain room. Once the large room under the upper chamber has filled the current will carry the delvers on into this tunnel.
> 
> The delvers will quickly discover that the walls are worn very smooth, and that the tunnel is fairly shallow. One of the ways a delver may discover the smoothness is by trying to stand up. Given the smooth rock and the swift current, standing up is out of the question. (No, Gargantua the Mighty, 15th. level warrior, strength has nothing to do with it.) The walls and ceiling are worn smooth as well.
> 
> The tunnel starts out as a 12 foot round tube. As it goes on the hapless crew will notice that it is sloped downward in an ever-increasing angle. The pace picks up as the volume of water is accelerated by gravity. Further along the tube begins to narrow, first to 10 feet round, 8 feet, finally to 6 feet. The water level rises almost to the top of the tube, and is accelerated still more. (Nope, Gargantua, sorry, strength fails again. Now even though the walls are close enough to press against they are still slick, and the water will back up against you increasing the weight with every passing second!)
> 
> This is all well and good you say but what 's the punch line? The chute, like all fun things must come to an end. By now the party's torches should be out, or at best casting a flickering light only inches from the roof of the tunnel. The party will be carried along at a pace that will be hard to determine, but everyone involved will know it is fast. All this sets the stage for the end of the tunnel.
> 
> Remember the dwarvish metal spears, and scythe blades? Remember Evinrood's fastidious preoccupation with keeping organic matter from backing up in the system? Remember that the end of most tunnels had a screen on them as a recurring design feature? At the end of the tunnel, with the party flying along at very good speed and little chance to stop, they will find a grating. Floor to ceiling spaced less than 8 inches apart are as nice a set of corrosion resistant dwarvish metal blades as you could imagine. As razor sharp as you could hope for! This should give any party encountering it cause to review their itinerary.
> 
> (Now you may think the party will end right here. Hasn 't thejact that they have gotten this far proven anything to you? Delvers are the most devious and conniving scum on the planet, and there are a few ways to escape even this trap. (If Gargantua has a magic sword that will destroy all other blades it encounters, for example,) So make it hard for the party to see this one coming, and force some high level luck usage.)
> 
> Without armor the gratings are 100% lethal. With armor there is still a 30% chance (L3) of death or dismembennentkeeping in mind that other delvers will stack up on the stopped one increasing the force!
> 
> This babe is three skulls if the party is unarmored dropping to two skulls if the party is armored. Either way, it's a really sharp little trap.
