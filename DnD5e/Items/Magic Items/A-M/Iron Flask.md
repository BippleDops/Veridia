## Description

This iron [[Glass Bottle|bottle]] has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the [[Flask or Tankard|flask]]’s command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you’re on, the target must succeed on a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 17 [[Wisdom|Wisdom]] saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has [[2 - Advantage and Disadvantage|advantage]] on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn’t age.

You can use an action to remove the [[Flask or Tankard|flask]]’s stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 [[7 - Time|hour]] and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its [[17 - Damage and Healing|death]], it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and [[2 - Alignment|alignment]].

An **[[Identify|identify]]** spell reveals that a creature is inside the [[Flask or Tankard|flask]], but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered [[Glass Bottle|bottle]] might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or determined randomly.
