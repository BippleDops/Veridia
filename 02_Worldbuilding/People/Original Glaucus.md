# Original Glaucus Tidecaller
*The True Senator, The Forgotten Voice, Prisoner of Kelp*

## Overview
The real Senator Glaucus Tidecaller has been imprisoned in the [[The Memory Meadows]] for three weeks, trapped within living kelp that slowly drains his memories while his shadow replacement [[Senator Glaucus]] takes his place in the [[Parliament of Echoes]]. Once a respected advocate for surface-depth reconciliation, he now struggles to maintain his identity as the kelp forest feeds on his past.

## Current Condition

### Physical State
- **Appearance**: Emaciated, pale, kelp strands growing through skin
- **Health**: Deteriorating, sustained only by kelp symbiosis
- **Mobility**: Bound by living kelp, limited movement
- **Voice**: Hoarse from calling for help no one hears
- **Eyes**: Still sharp with intelligence, desperate

### Mental State
- **Memory**: Losing 2-3 memories per day
- **Identity**: Clinging to core self, writing name repeatedly
- **Sanity**: Mostly intact but showing strain
- **Will**: Alternates between defiance and despair
- **Awareness**: Knows his shadow is free, feels its actions

## Background

### Before Replacement
**The People's Senator**
- Champion of surface trade relations
- Opposed isolation policies
- Investigated early shadow anomalies
- Respected across party lines
- Published treatise on diplomatic solutions

### Key Accomplishments

2. **Shadow Investigation Committee**: Founded it
3. **Depth-Surface Embassy**: His vision, never realized

5. **The Glaucus Doctrine**: Peaceful coexistence philosophy

### The Capture
**Three Weeks Ago**
- Investigating [[Reflection Pools]] at night
- Ambushed by [[Shadow Conspiracy]] agents

- Dragged to Memory Meadows while unconscious

## Imprisonment Details

**Living Bondage**
- Kelp strands pierce skin, create symbiosis
- Feeds him nutrients while stealing memories
- Grows tighter when he struggles
- Whispers his stolen memories back mockingly
- Slowly replacing his tissue with plant matter

### Daily Torment
1. **Dawn**: Kelp tightens, fresh memory extraction
2. **Morning**: Force-fed kelp nutrients
3. **Noon**: Visions of shadow's activities
4. **Afternoon**: Memory confusion, past blurs
5. **Evening**: Desperate attempts to remember
6. **Night**: Dreams of freedom, wakes to reality

### Political Allies (Former)

### Enemies
