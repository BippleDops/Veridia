--- # Ring of the Ram

*Ring, rare (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/ring-of-the-ram.webp#right) This ring has 3 charges and regains`d3`expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic action to expend 1 to 3 charges to make a ranged spell attack against one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The ring produces a spectral ram's head and makes its attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes``dice: 2d10``Force damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you. Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring's charges as a [actions#Magic|Magic]] action to try to break a nonmagical object you can see within 60 feet of yourself that isn't being worn or carried. The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each charge you spend. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 296.
