- Create investment in solving the conspiracy

## Opening Read-Aloud Text

> The pressure tube hisses to a stop, and through the reinforced crystal viewport, you see the sprawling underwater city of Port Meridian spread before you like a constellation of lights in the depths. Bioluminescent kelp forests sway in the gentle current, their glow casting ethereal shadows on the coral-encrusted buildings that rise from the seafloor in impossible spirals and organic curves.
>
> Your transport shudders gently as it docks at Terminal Seven, and you feel the subtle change in pressure as the airlock equalizes. Around you, other passengers—a mix of surface dwellers in pressure suits, native mer-folk with gills fluttering, and the strange adapted humans whose skin gleams with bioluminescent patches—gather their belongings.
>
> Through the speakers, a melodious voice announces: "Welcome to Port Meridian, jewel of the Aquabyssos trading routes. Current depth: 847 feet. External pressure: 26 atmospheres. Please ensure your pressure adaptations are functioning before disembarking. Harbor Master Luna Freedrift reminds all visitors that Port Meridian is a neutral port—violence is not tolerated, and all beings are welcome."
>
> As you step onto the dock, the weight of water above presses against your consciousness, and you smell the salt, kelp, and something else—the scent of secrets hiding in the depths.

## Scene 1: Arrival at Port Meridian

### The Harbor District Docks

Port Meridian's Harbor District is a marvel of underwater engineering, where massive coral formations have been shaped into docking platforms and buildings. Pressure tubes snake between structures like arteries, carrying passengers and cargo through the city's depths.

**Key Locations**:
- **Terminal Seven**: The party's arrival point
- **Harbor Master's Office**: Luna Freedrift's domain
- **The Customs House**: Where all cargo is processed
- **Pier 7**: Site of recent disappearances

### Initial Investigation Setup

**The Hook**: As the party disembarks, they're approached by **Deputy Harbor Master Coral Brightfin**, a mer-folk woman with urgent news.

**Coral Brightfin** (use Noble stats with swimming speed 40 ft):
- **Appearance**: Elegant mer-folk with coral-pink scales and elaborate shell jewelry
- **Personality**: Professional but clearly stressed
- **Voice**: Melodious but tight with worry

**Opening Dialogue**:
> "Excuse me, travelers. I'm Deputy Harbor Master Brightfin. I was told to watch for capable individuals arriving today. Harbor Master Freedrift needs to speak with people who aren't... locally invested in current politics. There's been a situation."

**Information Brightfin Provides**:
1. Three merchant ships have vanished in the past month
2. All disappeared on new moon nights
3. No distress signals, no wreckage, no survivors
4. Each carried "sensitive cargo"
5. Harbor Master Luna Freedrift is personally investigating
6. The Parliament of Echoes is demanding answers

**If Asked About Compensation**:
> "The Merchant's Covenant has posted a reward of 500 gold pieces for information leading to the recovery of their vessels. The Harbor Master may have additional resources for the right people."

**Skill Challenges During Introduction**:
- **Perception DC 13**: Notice the docks are less busy than expected for a major port
- **Insight DC 15**: Coral is holding back information about political tensions
- **Investigation DC 14**: Spot posted notices about the missing ships on public boards

### Meeting Harbor Master Luna Freedrift

**Location**: Harbor Master's Office—a grand coral chamber with flowing water features and bioluminescent lighting.

**Luna Freedrift** (use statistics from her character sheet):
- **Current Mood**: Concerned but determined
- **Goals**: Find trustworthy investigators, protect her network
- **Secrets**: Knows more about the conspiracy than she admits

**Office Description**:
> The Harbor Master's office combines natural beauty with practical function. Living coral forms the walls, pulsing gently with bioluminescent veins that provide soft illumination. Charts of underwater currents cover every surface, marked with pins and notes in multiple languages. Behind an imposing desk carved from a single massive shell sits Luna Freedrift, her sea-green eyes studying you with calculating intelligence.

**Luna's Opening Speech**:
> "Welcome to Port Meridian. I wish it were under better circumstances. I'm told you're not from around here, which might be exactly what this situation needs. We have ships vanishing in a pattern too precise to be random pirates or sea monsters. Someone is targeting specific vessels, and they know our schedules, our routes, and our security measures."
>
> "The missing ships are the *Coral Current*, the *Deep Fortune*, and the *Meridian's Pride*. Each carried different cargo, served different routes, but all disappeared the same way—completely, without trace, on nights when the moon was dark."

**Information Luna Provides** (some requires questioning):
1. **Ship Details**: All three were larger vessels, not small fishing boats
2. **Cargo Sensitivity**: Carried diplomatic pouches, rare materials, or passenger lists that shouldn't be public
3. **Pattern**: Always during new moon, always between midnight and dawn
4. **Security**: Each had standard magical protection and experienced crews
5. **No Traces**: No debris, no bodies, no magical signatures left behind

**What Luna Asks of the Party**:
> "I need people who can investigate without drawing attention. Start at Pier 7—that's where the *Meridian's Pride* was last seen. Talk to the dock workers, examine the area, follow any leads you find. But be discrete. If word spreads that we're actively investigating, our mysterious opponent might change tactics."

**Payment Offered**:
- 50 gold pieces each upfront
- Additional 200 gold pieces each for solid leads
- Access to harbor resources and contacts
- Protection under harbor neutrality laws

## Scene 2: Investigating Pier 7

### The Crime Scene

Pier 7 is a massive dock facility carved from living coral, with berths for large vessels and underwater storage chambers. Despite being underwater, air pockets and pressure fields allow air-breathing crew to work.

**Pier 7 Layout**:
- **Berth 7-A**: Where *Meridian's Pride* was moored (currently empty)
- **Storage Chamber 7**: Underwater cargo hold
- **Control Room**: Manages pressure systems and dock access
- **Workers' Rest Area**: Where dock crew take breaks

**Investigation Opportunities**:

#### Examining Berth 7-A
**Investigation DC 15**:
- Strange scrape marks on the coral, as if something large rubbed against it
- Traces of an unusual algae not native to this depth
- A single barnacle with metallic properties (magical analysis shows transmutation magic)

**Perception DC 18**:
- A small object wedged in a coral crevice: a brass button stamped with an anchor and wave pattern

**Arcana DC 16** (on the barnacle):
- The transmutation magic is designed to make organic matter appear as something else
- This could mask the true nature of a vessel's construction

#### Storage Chamber 7
**Accessible only underwater** - requires pressure adaptation or magical assistance.

**Investigation DC 14**:
- Cargo manifest still posted: "Diplomatic correspondence (sealed), 47 cases vintage spirits, 12 cases rare spices, passenger manifest (confidential)"
- Scratches on the chamber walls suggest it was searched hastily

**Insight DC 16**:
- Someone was looking for specific items, not conducting random theft
- The search pattern suggests they knew what they were seeking

#### Interviewing Dock Workers

**Dock Supervisor Finn Quickcurrent** (use Commoner stats):
- **Race**: Human (adapted - has gill slits and webbed fingers)  
- **Personality**: Nervous, wants to help but fears trouble
- **What He Knows**:
  - *Meridian's Pride* left on schedule at 11 PM
  - Captain seemed worried about something but wouldn't say what
  - Unusual number of new faces around the docks lately
  - Strange currents the night the ship disappeared

**Finn's Information** (requires Persuasion DC 13 or payment of 10 gp):
> "Look, I don't want trouble with the Harbor Master or... others. But that night, I saw someone in a black pressure suit watching from Observation Platform C. Never seen them before, never seen them since. And the currents—they were all wrong. Like something big was moving under us."

**Old Dock Worker "Barnacle" Pete** (use Commoner stats with swim speed):
- **Race**: Human (heavily adapted - scales, gills, enlarged eyes)
- **Personality**: Gruff, suspicious of outsiders, knows everyone's business
- **What He Knows** (requires gaining trust - see roleplay challenge below):
  - Ships have been disappearing for months, not just the three official ones
  - Smaller vessels, fishing boats, private craft
  - "Someone's building a fleet down in the dark places"
  - Heard talk of meetings in the old ruins

**Gaining Pete's Trust** (Roleplay Challenge):
- Show respect for adapted humans (+2 to checks)
- Share a drink of sea-kelp wine (+1 to checks)  
- Demonstrate knowledge of underwater life (+2 to checks)
- **Success DC**: Persuasion DC 16 (with modifiers)

**Young Worker Kaia Tidedancer** (use Scout stats):
- **Race**: Half-elf (sea heritage)
- **Personality**: Eager to help, knows dock gossip
- **What She Knows**:
  - Saw the *Coral Current* talking to another ship before it left
  - That ship had no identification markings
  - One of the missing ships' crew was asking questions about pressure tube schedules
  - Her boyfriend works in the Customs House and mentioned irregularities

### Skill Challenge: Following the Paper Trail

**Objective**: Trace the cargo manifests and documentation of the missing ships.

**Setup**: The party needs to examine official records in the Customs House without alerting corrupt officials to their investigation.

**Skills Used**:
- **Investigation**: Finding relevant documents
- **Deception**: Convincing officials they have legitimate business
- **Sleight of Hand**: Copying documents without being noticed
- **Persuasion**: Getting cooperation from honest workers
- **Insight**: Identifying which officials can be trusted

**Challenge Rating**: DC 15 (3 successes before 2 failures)

**Success Results**:
- **1 Success**: Find incomplete cargo manifests
- **2 Successes**: Discover pattern in cargo types
- **3 Successes**: Identify falsified documents and the official who signed them

**Failure Results**:
- **1 Failure**: Officials become suspicious
- **2 Failures**: Alert corrupt elements to the investigation

**Information Discovered on Success**:
1. All three ships carried more than their manifests listed
2. Additional cargo was logged under false classifications
3. **Customs Officer Marcus Greentide** signed off on all questionable paperwork
4. There are records of payments to "Port Security Consultants" (a front company)
5. The ships' true cargo included memory pearls, pressure-adaptation equipment, and sealed diplomatic pouches

## Scene 3: Following the First Clue

### Locating Customs Officer Marcus Greentide

**Marcus Greentide** (use Spy stats):
- **Race**: Human (minor adaptations - can hold breath for 30 minutes)
- **Appearance**: Middle-aged, well-dressed, nervous demeanor
- **Personality**: Greedy, cowardly, in over his head
- **Current Location**: The Deepcurrent Tavern (trying to drink away his conscience)

**The Deepcurrent Tavern** is a working-class establishment built into a natural cave system, with multiple chambers connected by water-filled passages.

**Tavern Description**:
> The Deepcurrent Tavern occupies a series of natural caverns, each chamber serving different clientele. The main room caters to air-breathing visitors with pressure-regulated atmosphere, while connected chambers serve those fully adapted to aquatic life. Bioluminescent fish swim in tanks that serve as both decoration and emergency food supply. The air carries scents of fermented kelp, roasted fish, and the mineral tang of deep ocean water.

### Confronting Marcus Greentide

**Approaching Marcus**:
Marcus is drunk and paranoid, sitting alone in a corner booth. He's clearly waiting for someone and checks the time frequently.

**Initial Reaction**: 
If approached directly, Marcus panics and tries to flee (Perception DC 14 to notice his distress before he bolts).

**Better Approaches**:
- **Deception**: Pretend to be his contact
- **Intimidation**: Corner him and demand answers
- **Persuasion**: Offer protection in exchange for information
- **Insight DC 17**: Realize he's terrified and needs reassurance

**Information Marcus Reveals** (if properly motivated):

**If Threatened** (Intimidation DC 15):
> "You don't understand! They'll kill me if they know I talked! The ships—they weren't just stolen, they were taken for a reason. Someone's building something down in the Abyssal Reaches, and they needed those specific supplies!"

**If Offered Protection** (Persuasion DC 18):
> "I never meant for people to die! I just falsified some paperwork, took some gold to look the other way. But then the crews started disappearing with the ships. They said they were just taking cargo, not... not murdering everyone!"

**If Convinced He's Talking to His Contact** (Deception DC 20):
> "Thank the depths you're here! The Harbor Master is getting suspicious. Freedrift has investigators now—real ones, not just port security. We need to warn the Commodore before they trace the connection to the base!"

**Key Information from Marcus**:
1. **The Mastermind**: Someone called "the Commodore" is organizing the thefts
2. **The Purpose**: Building or supplying something in deep water
3. **The Method**: Inside information from corrupt officials
4. **The Location**: References to "the base" and "Abyssal Reaches"
5. **The Timeframe**: Another operation planned for the next new moon (5 days away)
6. **The Contact**: He was supposed to meet someone tonight to deliver new ship schedules

### Ambush at the Tavern

**Timing**: 30 minutes after the party begins talking to Marcus, or immediately if they were too direct in their approach.

**The Attackers**: Three **Reef Sharks** (use Reef Shark stats but with crude pressure suits allowing them to operate in air pockets) led by a **Smuggler Captain** (use Bandit Captain stats with underwater equipment).

**Setup**: The attackers enter through the water-filled passages, using the tavern's multiple chambers to their advantage.

**Tactical Map** (describe to players):
- **Main Chamber**: Where most patrons sit (air-breathing)
- **Tidal Pool Chamber**: Half-flooded connection between areas
- **Deep Chamber**: Fully flooded, accessed by swimming
- **Private Booths**: Along walls, some elevated, some partially flooded
- **Kitchen**: Has both air and water work areas
- **Storage**: Underwater chambers with air pockets

**Combat Encounter: Smugglers' Ambush**

**Initiative Order Considerations**:
- Attackers come from underwater passages (surprise round if party fails Perception DC 15)
- Environmental factors affect movement and visibility
- Water provides cover but limits some attacks

**Smuggler Captain Tactics**:
- Stays in water initially, uses crossbow from cover
- Directs reef sharks to flank party
- Tries to capture Marcus alive, kill witnesses

**Reef Shark Tactics**:
- Use pack tactics when possible
- Attack from water, retreat when wounded
- Focus on weakest-looking party member

**Environmental Hazards**:
- **Pressure Differential**: Moving between air and water chambers requires Constitution saves (DC 12) or take 1 point of exhaustion
- **Slippery Surfaces**: Dexterity saves (DC 13) to avoid falling prone when moving quickly on wet coral
- **Limited Visibility**: Underwater areas have disadvantage on Perception checks beyond 30 feet

**Potential Complications**:
- **Tavern Patrons**: Innocent bystanders who might get hurt
- **Marcus Escapes**: If combat goes badly, Marcus might try to flee
- **Structural Damage**: The tavern's coral supports could be damaged, causing flooding

**Treasure**:
- **Smuggler Captain's Equipment**:
  - *Pressure Suit of Swimming* (functions as Cloak of the Manta Ray underwater)
  - Masterwork crossbow with 20 bolts
  - Pouch with 45 gold pieces and a coded message
  - Brass compass that points toward "base coordinates"

- **Coded Message** (requires Investigation DC 16 or cipher knowledge):
  > "Package collection delayed. Targets becoming aware. Recommend acceleration of timeline. Next shipment coordinates attached. —M.S."

**Social Aftermath**:
- **Tavern Owner** is grateful but nervous about future trouble
- **Other Patrons** are shocked but some offer information about the attackers
- **Harbor Guards** arrive 10 minutes after combat ends
- **Marcus** (if alive) is now completely terrified and willing to cooperate fully

### Post-Combat Investigation

**Examining the Bodies**:
- **Investigation DC 14**: The pressure suits are of unusual design, more advanced than standard equipment
- **Medicine DC 16**: The reef sharks show signs of artificial enhancement—scars from surgery
- **Arcana DC 18**: Detect traces of transmutation magic in the sharks' modifications

**The Coded Message Decoded**:
When decoded, reveals:
- Coordinates pointing to deep water southeast of Port Meridian
- Reference to "Commodore Shadowfin" as operational commander  
- Timeline indicating major operation in 3 days
- Mention of "acquired vessels" being prepared

**Marcus's Full Confession** (if he survived):
> "The Commodore contacted me months ago. Good money just to alter some paperwork, make certain ships look less valuable than they were. I thought it was just smuggling! Then they started taking the whole ships, crews and all. They said the crews were being 'relocated' but..."
>
> "There's a base somewhere deep, past the thermal vents. Ships go in, they don't come out the same. I've seen vessels I helped them steal, but... changed somehow. Wrong. The Commodore isn't just building a fleet—he's building something else entirely."

## Scene 4: Night Investigation

### Returning to Pier 7

**Time**: Late evening, 2-3 hours after the tavern incident.

**Setup**: The party returns to gather more evidence, but the pier is different at night—more dangerous, with different secrets revealed.

**Environmental Changes**:
- Bioluminescent lighting is dimmer
- Fewer workers, more opportunity for sneaking
- Deep current shifts bring different creatures
- Pressure variations make some areas inaccessible

**New Investigation Opportunities**:

#### Hidden Chamber Discovery
**Prerequisites**: Must examine Berth 7-A again with Investigation DC 18 (easier at night due to different lighting).

**Discovery**: A concealed pressure hatch leading to a maintenance tunnel system.

**The Tunnel System**:
> Narrow passages wind through the pier's structure, clearly not part of the original design. The walls show tool marks from recent excavation, and the water here carries a different mineral taste—deeper, older. These tunnels connect to the city's pressure tube network, but they're not on any official maps.

#### Surveillance Evidence
**Location**: The observation platform Finn mentioned.

**Investigation DC 16**:
- Find a spyglass hidden in a coral crevice
- The lens has been modified with magical enhancement
- Still warm to the touch—someone was here recently

**Perception DC 19**:
- Spot a figure watching from deeper in the harbor
- They flee when noticed (pursuit possible but dangerous)

#### Secret Meeting Discovery
**Timing**: If the party spends more than 1 hour investigating.

**Event**: Two smugglers meet near Storage Chamber 7 to discuss the next operation.

**Stealth Challenge**: DC 15 to avoid detection while eavesdropping.

**Overheard Conversation**:
> "—changed the timeline. The Harbor Master's people are getting close."
> "Commodore won't like delays. The conversion process needs those components."
> "What about the pressure suits? The new batch?"
> "Ready. But if we're caught with them..."
> "We won't be. The memory wipe is scheduled for tomorrow night."

**If Detected**: Combat with two **Smugglers** (use Bandit stats with underwater equipment).

**If Undetected**: Learn about:
- Memory modification procedures
- Schedule for "conversion process"
- Location hint: "the old mining platform"
- Mention of Captain Thalia Deepwater as a target

### Random Encounter: Corrupted Sea Creature

**Trigger**: If the party enters the maintenance tunnels or investigates too far from the main pier.

**Creature**: **Corrupted Giant Octopus** (use Giant Octopus stats with these modifications):
- **Appearance**: Covered in metallic barnacles, eyes glow with artificial light
- **New Ability**: *Electrical Discharge* - 20 ft radius, 2d6 lightning damage, Dex save DC 15
- **Behavior**: Aggressive but retreats if reduced to 25% health
- **Tactics**: Uses lair (maintenance tunnels) to advantage, attacks from multiple directions

**Environmental Factors**:
- Fighting in narrow, water-filled tunnels
- Limited movement and visibility
- Risk of tunnel collapse on critical misses with area effects

**Treasure**: The creature has swallowed a **Waterproof Bag** containing:
- Navigation charts of deep-sea routes
- 23 gold pieces
- A brass key marked with smuggler's code
- Vial of *Potion of Water Breathing*

## Scene 5: Late Night Revelations

### Returning to Harbor Master Freedrift

**Time**: Near midnight, when the party has gathered substantial evidence.

**Luna's Office**: Now dimly lit, with Luna working late over charts and documents.

**Luna's Reaction** to party's discoveries:
> "Commodore Shadowfin... I should have known. Marcus Shadowfin was dismissed from harbor service three years ago for corruption, but he had friends, connections. If he's calling himself 'Commodore' now..."

**New Information Luna Provides**:
1. **Marcus Shadowfin** was her former second-in-command
2. He was caught selling port security information
3. Has intimate knowledge of harbor operations and schedules
4. Known to hold grudges and has radical political views
5. Believes the Parliament of Echoes is too soft on surface world relations

**Luna's Concerns**:
> "If Shadowfin is behind this, he's not just stealing ships for profit. He's building toward something bigger—probably an incident that will justify harsh measures against surface trade. The Parliament has hawks who would love an excuse for aggressive expansion."

**Resources Luna Offers**:
- **Chart of Deep Waters**: Detailed maps of areas beyond normal shipping lanes
- **Pressure Adaptations**: Temporary adaptations for deeper investigation (see pressure mechanics)
- **Loyal Contacts**: Introduces party to Captain Thalia Deepwater
- **Official Authority**: Deputizes party as Harbor Investigators

### Meeting Captain Thalia Deepwater

**Location**: Luna calls her to the office for immediate meeting.

**Captain Thalia Deepwater** (use Veteran stats with swimming adaptations):
- **Race**: Human (adapted—gills, thick skin, pressure-resistant)
- **Appearance**: Weather-beaten, 50s, missing left eye, covered in scars
- **Ship**: *The Depthstrider* (currently in port for repairs)
- **Personality**: Gruff, direct, absolutely hates pirates and smugglers

**Thalia's Introduction**:
> "So you're the ones stirring up the smugglers' nest. Good. Marcus Shadowfin cost me half my crew two years ago when he leaked our patrol routes to raiders. If he's behind these disappearances, I want his head."

**Information Thalia Provides**:
1. **The Old Mining Platform**: Abandoned deep-sea mining operation, perfect smuggler base
2. **Route Analysis**: The missing ships were likely taken along the Deep Current
3. **Shadowfin's Methods**: Always plans multiple escapes, paranoid about betrayal
4. **The Conversion Process**: Heard rumors of ships being modified with stolen technology
5. **Timeline**: Next new moon is in 4 days—something big is planned

**Thalia's Offer**:
> "My ship's damaged, but I can get you closer to the deep waters than any pressure tube. Won't be comfortable, and it won't be safe, but if you want to catch Shadowfin before he disappears into the Abyssal Reaches, it's your best option."

### Setting Up Session 2

**End of Session Hooks**:

1. **Immediate Danger**: Intelligence suggests another ship will be targeted tomorrow night
2. **Time Pressure**: Major operation planned for new moon (4 days away)  
3. **Resource Decision**: Party must choose how to pursue investigation—official channels, stealth, or direct confrontation
4. **Character Development**: NPCs established provide ongoing support and complications

**Cliffhanger Ending**:
> As you discuss plans with Luna and Thalia, a young messenger bursts in, water streaming from his gill slits. "Harbor Master! Emergency at Pier 12—the *Golden Current* is under attack right now! They're trying to steal it while it's docked!"

**Experience and Rewards**:
- **Roleplay and Investigation**: 200 XP each
- **Combat Encounters**: 150 XP each  
- **Major Clue Discovery**: 100 XP each
- **Bonus for Creative Solutions**: 50 XP each
- **Total Expected**: 500-600 XP each

**Treasure Gained**:
- Payment from Luna Freedrift: 50 gp each
- Loot from smugglers: varies based on encounters
- Magical items: Pressure suit components, navigation tools
- Information: Worth more than gold for the investigation

**Hour 2**: Investigation of Pier 7, gathering clues
**Hour 3**: Following leads, talking to Marcus Greentide  
**Hour 4**: Tavern ambush, combat encounter
**Hour 5**: Night investigation, meeting Thalia, setting up next session

### Improvisation Guidelines

**If Players Skip Important Locations**:
- Have NPCs redirect them with new information
- Move important clues to wherever they do investigate
- Use random encounters to guide them back on track

**If Players Become Stuck**:
- Have Luna Freedrift provide additional resources
- Introduce new witness with crucial information
- Create time pressure with immediate threat

**If Players Want to Rush to Combat**:
- Let them, but make consequences clear
- Smugglers are prepared and well-equipped
- Information gathering becomes harder after direct confrontation

### Alternate Paths

**Diplomatic Approach**:
- Focus on working within official channels
- More interaction with Parliament representatives
- Different types of challenges and opposition

**Stealth-Heavy Approach**:
- Emphasize infiltration and surveillance
- More opportunities for sneaking and spying
- Different risk/reward balance

**Combat-Heavy Approach**:
- Add more encounters with smuggler patrols
- Make investigation more about following combat leads
- Include more dangerous creatures and situations

### Key Themes to Emphasize

1. **Underwater World**: Constant reminders of the unique environment
2. **Political Complexity**: Multiple factions with different goals
3. **Investigation Skills**: Reward clever thinking over combat prowess
4. **Personal Stakes**: Show how the conspiracy affects ordinary people
5. **Environmental Storytelling**: Let the setting reveal parts of the story

### Session Success Indicators

By the end of Session 1, players should:
- Understand the basic mystery and their role
- Have met key NPCs and established relationships
- Gathered at least 3 major clues about the conspiracy
- Experienced underwater combat and environmental challenges
- Be invested in stopping Commodore Shadowfin's plans
- Have clear direction for the next session's investigation

---

*The depths hold many secrets, but some secrets are worth killing for. As the party delves deeper into the conspiracy, they'll find that in Port Meridian, every current carries whispers, and not all of them are friendly.*
