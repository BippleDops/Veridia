# Vanrak's Mithral Shirt
*Medium Armor, uncommon*  

- **Armor Class**: 13 + DEX (max of +2)
- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 20.0 lbs.

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/rules/skills.md#Stealth)) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't.

While you wear this armor, you gain [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision) out to a range of 60 feet.
