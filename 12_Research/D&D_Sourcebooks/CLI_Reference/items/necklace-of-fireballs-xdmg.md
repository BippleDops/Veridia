# Necklace of Fireballs
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/necklace-of-fireballs.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This necklace has `1d6 + 3` beads hanging from it. You can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a level 3 [[fireball-xphb|Fireball]] (save DC 15).

You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, at one time. When you do so, increase the damage of the Fireball by `d6` for each bead after the first (maximum `12d6`).
