## Secrets and Hidden Aspects

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Democratic Surveillance Network
> Despite its democratic ideals, the Hegemony operates a sophisticated intelligence network monitoring threats to democratic institutions. This network, known only to top leadership, gathers information on anti-democratic conspiracies, [[Foreign Intelligence]] operations, and internal threats. While established with good intentions, there are growing concerns about surveillance overreach and the potential for abuse. Some progressive leaders are beginning to question whether secret surveillance can ever be compatible with true democratic transparency.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Ancient Tethyan Inheritance
> Deep beneath [[New Tethys lie sealed chambers containing the accumulated knowledge and treasures of the ancient Tethyan Empire. This inheritance includes not only vast wealth but also powerful artifacts and knowledge that could transform the balance of power in [Aquabyssos]]. The democratic government knows of their existence but has chosen not to access them, fearing that such power could corrupt democratic institutions. However, growing pressures may force them to reconsider this decision.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Deep Democracy Project
> A secret research project is developing ways to extend democratic goverce to the deepest parts of the ocean, including areas with crushing pressure that normal inhabitants cannot survive. This involves creating new forms of representation for pressure-adapted communities and potentially developing technology to allow broader participation in deep-sea democracy. The project is controversial even within the government due to questions about the costs and risks of such expansion.
