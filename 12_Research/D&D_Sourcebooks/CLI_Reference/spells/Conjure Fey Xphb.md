# Conjure Fey
*6th-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You conjure a Medium spirit from the Feywild in an unoccupied space you can see within range. The spirit lasts for the duration, and it looks like a Fey creature of your choice. When the spirit appears, you can make one melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes Psychic damage equal to `3d12` plus your spellcasting ability modifier, and the target has the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Frightened|Frightened]] condition until the start of your next turn, with both you and the spirit as the source of the fear.

As a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] on your later turns, you can teleport the spirit to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of the space it left and make the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d12` for each spell slot level above 6.

**Classes**: [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid|Druid]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock|Warlock]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]
