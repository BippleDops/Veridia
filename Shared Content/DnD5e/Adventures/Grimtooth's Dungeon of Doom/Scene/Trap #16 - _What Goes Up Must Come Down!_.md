# Trap #16 - "What Goes Up Must Come Down!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> Once the party has negotiated the door opening mechanism they are confronted by a 10 foot wide stair case going up 50 feet. The ceiling near the doors is 60 feet high tapering as the stair rises to a mere 10 feet At the top of the stairs can be seen, faintly in the light of your torches or lanterns, a set of doors that are different from the usual stuccoed stone doors, found throughout the tomb. From here it is hard to tell but they may be wooden.
> 
> The delvers attention will hopefully be focused on the doors at the far end and as such they will not be thinking of a trap on the stairs themselves. It is the stairs that form the trap.
> 
> The design for these stairs was so homey it took me back to my very roots. Oh, how I long for those early years, the innocent naivete of the delvers, the lovely gasps of shock as they stumbled from trap to trap. ..s igh. In TRAPS ONE there was a stair trap, the fabulous FOLLY FLIGHT, designed by the fabled trap master John R. Greer. This stair trap seems to be a variation on the FOLLY FLIGHT theme.
> 
> The stairs are hinged at the base, and when a delver, or delvers reach a point 25 feet from the bottom the weight will pass the balance point and cause the pins at the center point to release. Unlike John's trap, "Evinrood's Variation" causes the entire length of the stair to fall back against the near wall. This reveals the stairwell for the cleep narrow room it really is. The chamber thus formed is 110 feet deep, (50 feet to the ceiling, and an additional 60 feet to the floor.) and 50 feet across to the doors near the roof on thefar side. The room is still only 10 feet wide.
> 
> Filling the bottom of this trap with spears, spikes, or acid excreting slugs would provide a wonderful counterpoint to the delvers plunge to his likely demise. Evinrood just left the floor plain old stone, trusting the fall alone to do in would-be tomb robbers. Perhaps he did not want to discourage the parties too much.
> 
> The delvers will not be put off for long by this trap. Luckily it is only part one. Almost immediately one of the delvers will think of trying to shoot a rope over to the doors on the far side. The plan may be to use this rope to rescue the remains of their fallen comrades, or more likely to gain access to the far end of the room. The doors on the far end of the room consist of heavy wooden beams bound by old rusted iron bands. They have no hinges and are only wed ged in place, a fact that the delvers wilJ not be able to tell across 50 feet of space by torch light. A stout tug, such as one that the party might give to see if the arrow has seated will not be enough to pull the doors free. In fact the weight of one average delver will not be enough to dislodge them, but once more than the weight of one delver is applied the doors will come free. Granted this is just an elaboration, but picture the looks on the faces of your victims as they attempt to cross over, hand over hand, or better still climbing up from the floor below as the doors come free and plummet down upon them.
> 
> Eventually the party will find a way into the room behind those wooden doors, probably by climbing up the far wall using pitons and ropes like mountain climbers. Having invested this much time, and effort they will have to go on! Dungeon delvers are like that.
> 
> If this trap is operated as is, it is a three skuller, but if embellished with spears, or acid pools it can go all the way up to four!
