### Moccasins (Pic)

## Description
These shoes have recently been imported from Maztica. They are similar in style to the low, soft boot, but they have soft soles, and are laced for added fit. No weapon sheaths can be sewn into these, as the fit is too snug, but they are very quiet. We sell them for 2 gp a pair.

## Additional Details
a character wearing moccasins gains +5 % to move silently, but these cannot be worn by non-Maztican natives for more than one day, due to lack of arch support. For each day of use, a character must go 1 day with regular shoes, to rest his feet.
