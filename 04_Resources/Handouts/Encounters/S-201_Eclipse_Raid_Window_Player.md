# Eclipse Raid Window

The light goes strange. Shadows lengthen in the wrong direction, and the air feels thin.

What you notice
- A hush across the deck
- Stars faint in daytime

What you can try
- Keep formation tight
- Trust the cadence of the anchor song

Possible outcomes
- You slip through unseen
- Someone missteps in the half-light
- The enemy finds you first
