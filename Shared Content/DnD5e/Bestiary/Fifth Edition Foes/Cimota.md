## Special Traits
**Lifesense:** A cimota notices and locates all living creatures within 60 ft., without effort or error.

**Magic Proof:** A cimota automatically succeeds on saving throws against spells and magic effects unless it chooses not to.

**Manifestation:** As an action, a cimota can transport itself from any point on the Material Plane to another point within its defined area or within 300 feet of the artifact to which it is bound. A cimota can also lurk on the Negative Plane, prepared to manifest on the Material Plane if certain conditions are met, such as trespassers entering the area the cimota is doomed to guard. A cimota can't attack or move in the round in which it manifests"it is effectively stunned until the start of its next turn. When it manifests, it appears as a shifting cloud of shadows that coalesces into its cloaked and hooded form. Until the start of its next turn (the round after it manifests), its shifting form has the effect of a blur spell.

**Unholy Existence:** Although it is possible to temporarily destroy a cimota's physical form, it will return in `dice: 1d6` days, manifesting again to continue its unholy existence. The only way to permanently destroy a cimota is to disrupt its existence by consecrating the ground to which it is tied or by destroying the artifact to which it is bound. Sometimes, significant alteration of an unholy place, such as demolition of an evil temple or burning a haunted forest, could cause cimota to fade away permanently.

**Unnatural Aura:** All animals, wild or trained, become frightened when a cimota is within 30 feet. Trained animals will approach closer if their master makes a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. The check allows trained animals to approach the cimota but does not eliminate the tactical disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls because of fright.

## Actions

**Claw:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d8+3`) slashing damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, or haunt (3–6)

## Description
Cimota are the physical manifestations of evil thoughts and actions. They exist on the Negative Plane, manifesting in the Material Plane as indistinct, cloaked figures. Their existence is always tied to a specific area or artifact that is imbued with ancient and highly malevolent evil. A cimota is able to manifest anywhere within an accursed locale that has given it life or within 300 feet of an evil artifact to which it is attached, but it can’t leave that area on the Material Plane.

The physical form of a cimota is a floating figure in a monk’s cassock. Green eyes glow deep within their raised cowls, but their bodies are entirely invisible. See invisibility, true seeing, or similar abilities to see invisible objects reveal a ghostly human figure seemingly made of shadow within the cloak. Cimota are manifestations of evil that can be touched like any other creature, and even injured by nonmagical weapons, though magic has reduced effect against them. When a cimota is destroyed, only a few shreds of tattered black cloth remain to show that they ever existed.

Cimota are bound to repeat the evil thoughts and actions that created them. When they manifest, they endlessly repeat the deeds that spawned them. So, for instance, a group of cimota might haunt a ruined temple where they endless reenact evil rituals. Cimota might guard an unholy site such as a city, forest, or building. They fight to the death to defend these places. Cimota who are bound to an artifact might act out the intentions of that artifact. A cimota might follow the owner of an artifact, for example, slaying the owner’s friends and associates (to prevent them from stealing the artifact, in their greed) while keeping its existence a secret. Within the parameters of their creation, cimota are capable of strategy, deception, and highly intelligent tactics.

Cimota are capable of speaking Common and Infernal. Their voices are either hollow, ringing, and unnatural, or malevolent whispers. Most often, cimota use their voices to chant or to shout dire condemnations at intruders. They do not parley and they never negotiate unless it is to deceive mortals to their deaths.
