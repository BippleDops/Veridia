# Fiendish Vigor
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 155. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span>*  

**Prerequisite**: Level 2 Warlock

You can cast [False Life](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/false-life-xphb.md) on yourself without expending a spell slot. When you cast the spell with this feature, you don't roll the die for the [Temporary Hit Points](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb.md); you automatically get the highest number on the die.
