## Description
In a lab stocked with acid, bat guano, and mercury, a good apron can avert death as well as embarrassing stains. Our clay-steeped canvas aprons cover the body from neck to ankle and resist stains, acids, and fires (4 gp). We also offer a leather apron with an attached beard pocket and hood to protect decades of hair growth. (10 gp)

## Additional Details
+1 bonus to saves rolled for fire or acid attacks; item saves: acid 9, magical fire 6, normal fire 4; 3 aprons of the first type are requisite for a complete lab
