> [!danger] DM Secret
> The Azure Citadel was not built where it is by accident. It sits directly above a sealed portal to [[The Hadal Depths]] that predates the Great Drowning. The entire fortress is actually a massive containment facility, and its real purpose is not to defend [[Aquabyssos]] from external threats, but to prevent something far worse from escaping into the world. [[Admiral Thorne Blackwater]] knows this truth, and it's part of what's driving him to madness - he realizes that if the citadel ever falls, the thing beneath it will be the least of their problems.
