## Player-Facing Summary

Races is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of races as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around races.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.

## Rule Summary

Races provides a systematic approach to handling specific game situations. This mechanic integrates with core D&D 5e rules while adding depth to gameplay.

## When to Use

- Specific trigger conditions are met
- Players request this type of action
- The situation calls for additional detail

- This Ability: 2d8+3 (avg 12)
- Conclusion: Comparable but trades consistency for variance

### Resource Economy

- Comparable feature: Action Surge (1/rest)
- Balance note: More uses but weaker effect
