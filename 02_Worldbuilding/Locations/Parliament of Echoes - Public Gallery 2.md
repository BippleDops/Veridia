# Parliament of Echoes - Public Gallery

*"Where the voice of the people meets the chambers of power, and democracy breathes in the depths."*

## Overview

The Public Gallery of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Parliament of Echoes represents one of [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]'s most progressive democratic innovations - a magnificent observation space where citizens can witness their representatives in action and participate in the political process. This architectural marvel, built into the soaring upper reaches of the Parliament complex, provides seating for up to 800 observers while offering unobstructed views of the legislative chambers below.

More than a mere spectator area, the Public Gallery serves as the beating heart of Aquabyssos democracy, where public opinion is shaped, political movements are born, and the ancient tradition of citizen engagement with government continues to evolve. The Gallery's unique acoustic design allows visitors to hear every word spoken in the chambers below, while advanced magical dampening fields ensure that disruptions from above cannot interfere with parliamentary proceedings.
