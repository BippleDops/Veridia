## Description
Long favored by bards of all stripes, our [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Bards' Emporium/Other Equipment/Bamsmacks|bamsmacks]] and smokers add a flair to any performance. The [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Bards' Emporium/Other Equipment/Bamsmacks|bamsmacks]] are made from Malatran bamboo sections filled with salt, and they create a jarring smack when set aflame. The smokers are merely finger-sized chunks of [[Incense|incense]] that belch smoke when thrown into a brazier. When tied together and thrown into flame, [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Bards' Emporium/Other Equipment/Bamsmacks|bamsmacks]] and smokers create an effect like wizardsâ€™ magic. Bamsmack: 5 gp; smoker: 3 gp.
