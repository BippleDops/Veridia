# Shapechange
*9th-level, Transmutation*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/shapechange.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a jade circlet worth 1,500+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You shape-shift into another creature for the duration or until you take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to shape-shift into a different eligible form. The new form must be of a creature that has a [[challenge-rating-xphb (variant-rules)]] no higher than your level or [[challenge-rating-xphb (variant-rules)]]. You must have seen the sort of creature before, and it can't be a Construct or an Undead.

When you cast the spell, you gain a number of [[temporary-hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] equal to the [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] of the first form into which you shape-shift. These [[temporary-hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] vanish if any remain when the spell ends.

Your game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen form, but you retain your creature type; alignment; personality; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]]; [[hit-point-dice-xphb (variant-rules)]]; proficiencies; and ability to communicate. If you have the Spellcasting feature, you retain it too.

Upon shape-shifting, you determine whether your equipment drops to the ground or changes in size and shape to fit the new form while you're in it.

**Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]
