## Traits

### Creature Type

You are Undead.

### Undead Fortitude

If damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5+the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

### Undead Nature

You are immune to poison damage, and you can't be [[conditions#Poisoned|poisoned]]. You don't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Darkvision

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Languages

You can't speak, but you can understand the languages you knew in life.

## Player-Facing Summary

Zombie dmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of zombie dmg as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around zombie dmg.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties zombie dmg to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at zombie dmg to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to zombie dmg active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
