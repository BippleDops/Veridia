# Session 6: The Bloodline Awakens

> *One party member begins to crystallize, but unlike plague victims, the crystals form protective patterns.*

## üé¨ Strong Start

One party member begins to crystallize, but unlike plague victims, the crystals form protective patterns. Ancient memories flood their mind - they see [[Aquabyssos]] in its glory, and their ancestor helping to create the Seven Shards prison. [[The Crimson Sage]] arrives: "We have 24 hours. Your awakening has accelerated everything."

## üìç Scenes

### Scene 1: The Bloodline Test
- **Location**: Hidden sanctuary beneath lighthouse
- **Situation**: Determining which party member carries the bloodline
- **Conflict**: Painful awakening process triggers defensive mechanisms
- **Discovery**: The bloodline carrier can control crystal formations

### Scene 2: The Faction Summit
- **Location**: Neutral ground at the Merchant Guildhall
- **Situation**: Desperate alliance negotiations
- **Conflict**: [[High Inquisitor Maltheos]] attempts coup
- **Discovery**: Each faction leader has been hiding a shard

### Scene 3: The Memory Dive
- **Location**: Psychic realm within the bloodline carrier
- **Situation**: Recovering ancient memories to understand the ritual
- **Conflict**: Mental defenses and traumatic ancestral memories
- **Discovery**: The original ritual's purpose and how to modify it

### Scene 4: The Shard Hunt
- **Location**: Multiple faction strongholds
- **Situation**: Rapid retrieval of remaining shards
- **Conflict**: Time pressure vs. security measures
- **Discovery**: One shard is already at the festival grounds

## üîç Secrets & Clues

1. The Seventh Shard isn't an object - it's a living bloodline
2. The Drowned God was actually Aquabyssos's magical defense system
3. The plague transformation would make humans compatible with Aquabyssos
4. [[The Crimson Sage]] has been weakening the prison to prevent catastrophic release
5. [[Marina-Red-Tide-Coralheart]]'s organization has been protecting bloodline descendants
6. [[High Inquisitor Maltheos]]'s son is another bloodline carrier
7. The festival ground was chosen because it's directly above Aquabyssos
8. The original ritual can be inverted to seal the city permanently
9. [[Vex Shadowthorn]] is still alive and has the sixth shard
10. The Queen retains enough control to help if approached correctly

## üé≠ Cliffhanger Ending

With five shards gathered, the party races toward the festival. They arrive to find thousands of citizens already gathered, swaying in unison. The crystallized Queen stands at the center of a massive runic circle, the sixth shard floating above her. As the sun sets, she speaks in harmony with the crowd: "The Seventh comes. The circle closes. Aquabyssos rises." The bloodline carrier feels an irresistible pull toward the circle as their crystalline patterns begin spreading uncontrollably.

## üìù DM Notes
```
Key Decision Points:
- Who carries the bloodline (player choice or dice?)
- How much to reveal about Aquabyssos
- Maltheos coup success level
- Faction alliance stability
```

## üé≤ Contingencies
- **If party refuses bloodline**: Marina is backup carrier
- **If coup succeeds**: Underground resistance forms
- **If they miss shards**: Crimson Sage has emergency stash
- **If they take too long**: Festival begins early
