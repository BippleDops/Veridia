# Quest - The Missing Fleet
*A Diplomatic Crisis Beneath the Waves*

> *"When ships vanish without a trace and nations point fingers, someone must dive beneath the surface of both water and politics to find the truth that could prevent a war."*
> â€” [[Admiral Marina Stormcrest]], briefing the investigation team

## Quest Overview

The Missing Fleet is a complex investigation and diplomatic mission that challenges players to solve a maritime mystery while navigating delicate political relationships between [[Aethermoor]] and its neighboring realms. When an entire diplomatic fleet disappears during routine negotiations, the party must uncover the truth behind their fate while preventing the incident from escalating into open conflict.

This quest combines elements of naval investigation, underwater exploration, political intrigue, and diplomatic problem-solving, requiring players to use investigation skills, social abilities, and combat prowess to resolve a situation that threatens regional stability.

## Background and Context

### The Diplomatic Mission

Three weeks ago, [[Admiral Diplomatic Envoy Thornwick]] departed [[Aethermoor]] with a fleet of five ships carrying a delegation intended to negotiate new trade agreements with the [[Coral Reef Republics]]. The fleet included the flagship *Windward Negotiator*, two escort vessels, a supply ship, and a specialized communication vessel equipped for long-range magical correspondence.

The diplomatic mission represented months of careful preparation and significant political investment, as the proposed trade agreements could provide [[Aethermoor]] with access to rare deep-sea resources while offering the Coral Reef Republics expanded markets for their unique magical goods.

Initial reports indicated that the fleet had safely reached international waters and established contact with Coral Reef Republic representatives, suggesting that negotiations were proceeding according to schedule.

### The Disappearance

Four days ago, all communication with the diplomatic fleet ceased abruptly during what should have been routine daily reports. Search and rescue operations have found only scattered debris that may or may not be connected to the missing vessels.

The Coral Reef Republics claim no knowledge of what happened to the fleet after their representatives departed following successful preliminary negotiations. They have offered full cooperation with search efforts but maintain that the fleet left their territorial waters safely.

Political tensions are rising as some [[Aethermoor]] officials suggest that the disappearance may not be accidental, while others worry that accusations without evidence could damage crucial diplomatic relationships and derail important negotiations.

### Rising Tensions

The disappearance has created a complex political crisis, with various factions within [[Aethermoor]] government advocating different responses ranging from immediate military action to patient investigation and diplomatic pressure.

Rumors and speculation are spreading throughout [[Aethermoor]] society, with some suggesting sabotage by trade rivals, others blaming sea monsters or magical phenomena, and conspiracy theorists proposing elaborate plots involving multiple governments.

The [[Coral Reef Republics]] are becoming increasingly defensive about repeated questioning of their involvement, while other neighboring powers are watching the situation carefully to assess implications for their own relationships with [[Aethermoor]].

## Quest Objectives

3. **Preserve Diplomatic Relations** - Conduct the investigation in a manner that maintains positive relationships with the Coral Reef Republics and other regional powers, avoiding actions that could escalate tensions unnecessarily.

4. **Prevent Political Crisis** - Provide clear, accurate information to [[Aethermoor]] leadership to enable informed decision-making and prevent hasty actions that could damage long-term political interests.

### Secondary Objectives

1. **Rescue Survivors** - If any fleet personnel survived whatever caused the disappearance, locate and rescue them while providing necessary medical and psychological support.

2. **Recover Diplomatic Materials** - Retrieve sensitive diplomatic documents, trade agreements, and communication records that could be valuable for future negotiations or politically damaging if obtained by hostile parties.
