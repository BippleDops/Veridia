## Special Traits
**Lethargy:** By speaking, singing, or roaring, the lionwere causes all creatures that can hear it and that are within 60 feet of it to make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effect of a slow spell lasting `dice: 1d6` rounds. A creature that saves successfully is immune to lethargy until after its next long rest. Therianthropes are immune to lethargy.

**Shapechanger**: The lionwere can change from its lion form or human form to its hybrid form as a bonus action. Changing from lion form directly to human form or vice versa takes an action. The lionwere is Large in lion form but Medium in human or hybrid form. In lion form, it is indistinguishable from a normal lion.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** In hybrid form, a lionwere attacks twice with claws or once with its greatsword. In human form, it attacks once with its greatsword. In lion form, it makes two melee attacks and can also use its lethargy ability.

**Bite (lion form):** *Melee Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d6+4`) piercing damage.

**Claws (lion/hybrid form):** *Melee Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d6+4`) slashing damage.

**Greatsword (human/hybrid form):** *Melee Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (`dice: 2d8+4`) slashing damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Warm plains and underground

**Organization**: Solitary, gang (2–5), or pack (1 plus 5–8 lions)

## Description
Lionweres appear as very stocky, muscular humanoids when in humanoid form. They have a tendency to brag and to bully people who can’t fight back; the more helpless the victim, the more vicious the bullying will be and the more it will amuse the lionwere. A lionwere bullies because it’s sadistic, not because it’s cowardly, so a lionwere doesn’t back down when challenged by someone; in fact, it relishes the fight. They sometimes seek work in civilized areas as bodyguards and bouncers, where their size, strength, and lack of empathy come in handy.
