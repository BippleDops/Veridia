## Description
Dark tritons resemble their more benevolent cousins, the normal tritons, but they are malevolent creatures. Just as the normal tritons are rumored to be servants of a sea god, the dark tritons are servants of oceanic demons of various types, most commonly the [[Thalasskoptis, Demon Prince|demon-prince]] [[Thalasskoptis, Demon Prince|Thalasskoptis]].

Dark tritons have tentacles rather than the fishlike “legs” of normal tritons. They often ride [[Giant Moray Eel|giant moray eels]] as mounts when traveling in the dark depths of the sea, where they dwell in their castlelike lairs on the sea floor.

For every 10 dark tritons, either in their lair or in a hunting party, there will be a lieutenant with 50 hit points and two melee attacks per round (CR 3). For every two lieutenants, there will be a captain with 70 hit points and three melee attacks per round (CR 5). Roll a die for each leader; for each even result, add one triton shaman to the group (CR 2).
