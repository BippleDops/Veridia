# Scroll of Titan Summoning (Colossus)
*Scroll, legendary*  

When you take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to read this scroll, a [[colossus xmm|Colossus]] appears in an unoccupied space on the ground or in water that you can see within 1 mile of yourself.

The [[colossus xmm|Colossus]] is [[hostile attitude xphb|Hostile]] toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 [[hit points xphb|Hit Points]]. If the [[colossus xmm|Colossus]] is summoned into a space that isn't large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted.
