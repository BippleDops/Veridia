## Special Traits
***Out-of-Phase Movement.*** The seer can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. Each creature it moves through takes 5 ( `dice: 1d10`) psychic damage; no creature can take this damage more than once per turn. The seer takes 5 ( `dice: 1d10`) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The seer makes two comet staff attacks or uses Psychic Orb twice.

***Comet Staff.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 ( `dice: 1d6+6`) bludgeoning damage plus 18 ( `dice: 4d8`) psychic damage, or 10 ( `dice: 1d8+6`) bludgeoning damage plus 18 ( `dice: 4d8`) psychic damage, if used with two hands, and the target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of its next turn.

***Psychic Orb.** Ranged Spell Attack:* +11 to hit, range 120 feet, one target. Hit: 27 ( `dice: 5d10`) psychic damage.

***Collapse Distance (Recharge 6).*** The seer warps space around a creature it can see within 30 feet of it. That creature must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, is magically teleported up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space the seer can see, and all other creatures within 10 feet of the target's original space each takes 39 ( `dice: 6d12`) psychic damage. On a successful save, the target takes 19 ( `dice: 3d12`) psychic damage.

## Reactions
***Bend Space.*** When the seer would be hit by an attack, it teleports, exchanging positions with another star spawn it can see within 60 feet of it. The other star spawn is hit by the attack instead.

## Description
A star spawn seer is most often encountered as the leader of a cult that worships one or more of the Elder Evils. Usually, the seer is the only cult member that grasps the full extent of the horror the cult is venerating.

An entity that appears as a star spawn seer in the Material Plane usually arrives as something different—something disembodied. When a warlock or other spellcaster establishes communication with it, the seer-entity takes control of the mortal's form and spirit, transforming it into a star spawn seer. Whoever the seer once was largely vanishes beneath the corpulent bulk of tumorous skin than builds up in strange whorls all over the seer's body. Hands become bulky, flipper-like appendages capable of grasping their strange staffs—formed of some blend of flesh, bone, and star stuff—but clumsy and painful when used to manipulate other things.

A star spawn seer is almost always accompanied by one or more [[Star Spawn Hulk|star spawn hulks]]. Although the hulk is a worthy combatant in its own right, it's also a vital part of a tactic often used by seers. When a seer deals psychic damage to a hulk, the hulk isn't hurt, while the effect ricochets off the hulk and expands to assault other creatures.

The seer's goal is to tap the energy sources and master the rites that will enable it to extend a bridge between the vulnerable sanity of the Material Plane and the squirming madness of an Elder Evil's prison.
