## Special Traits
**Filament:** A creature struck by a cave fisher's filament becomes grappled by the sticky thread and is pulled 20 feet closer to the cave fisher. A grappled creature can use its action to rip the filament free with a DC 13 Strength check, or can attack the filament directly (AC 12, 5 hp, resistant to all but slashing damage). Alcohol or universal solvent dissolves the adhesive and releases the creature caught by the filament. A cave fisher can have only one creature grappled at a time.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The cave fisher attacks once with its filament or twice with claws.

**Claw:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d6+3`) slashing damage.

**Filament:** *Ranged Attack:* +3 to hit, range 60 ft., one creature. Hit: the target is grappled and pulled 20 feet closer to the cave fisher (see below).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Underground

**Organization**: Solitary or gang (2–4)

## Description
The cave fisher is a 7-foot long creature with a hard outer shell that makes it resemble a large beetle. It can shoot a strong, sticky, weblike filament from its extended snout. The creature uses this filament to trap and drag prey to within range of the cave fisher’s slicing claws.

The cave fisher lairs on ledges and cliffs underground, where it can quickly strike passing prey and reel it up to its mouth. Its lair is always littered with bones and gear from previous victims, and hanging shreds of spent filaments.

The cave fisher’s preferred method of attack is to anchor itself to its ledge and string filament across the ground of its lair. When a living creature touches or passes near the filament, the fisher attempts to trap it and reel it in, all while remaining safely sheltered on its ledge. If this initial trap fails, the cave fisher can move forward to the lip of the ledge and launch its filament like an anteater’s tongue at an opponent up to 60 feet away, but this exposes it to attack from below. Another favored method of attack for the cave fisher is to hide itself in a crack or a ledge above a cavern and dangle its filament down onto unsuspecting creatures passing below it.
