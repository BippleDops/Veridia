# Senator Glaucus Tidecaller
## Shadow Replacement

> *"Welcome to the depths where light drowns! Forgive me, that's not funny where you're from."*

## Description

### Physical Appearance
Senator Glaucus appears as a tall, unnaturally thin figure whose translucent skin reveals dark veins pulsing beneath. His eyes are completely blackâ€”no whites, no iris, just pools of darkness that seem to absorb light. When he moves, his shadow doesn't quite match his actions, often gesturing independently or remaining still when he walks.

### Personality
- **Public Face:** Overly welcoming, laughs at inappropriate moments
- **True Nature:** Calculating, serving the shadow agenda
- **Mannerisms:** Tilts head at odd angles, never blinks
- **Speech Pattern:** Oscillates between formal senate speak and dark humor

## Background

### Before Replacement
The original Glaucus was a respected senator, advocate for surface-depth trade relations, and opponent of isolation policies. He investigated shadow anomalies three weeks ago and disappeared for two days.

### The Replacement
Three weeks ago, Glaucus was ambushed at the [[Reflection Pools]] and underwent forced shadow separation. His shadow gained independence and replaced him, while the original was imprisoned in the [[2-World/Places/The Memory Meadows]]. The shadow retained all of Glaucus's memories but none of his morality.

### Current Activities
- Pushing for the [[Shadow Citizenship Act]]
- Identifying targets for shadow replacement
- Maintaining cover while serving [[2-World/People/Shadow Duchess Nyx]]
- Sabotaging investigations into shadow conspiracy

## Relationships

### Allies
- **[[2-World/People/Shadow Duchess Nyx]]** - Direct superior in shadow hierarchy
- **[[Shadow Parliament]]** - Secret organization of replaced officials
- **[[Tenebrarum Ambassadors]]** - Fellow shadows

### Rivals
- **[[2-World/People/The Scattered Emperor]]** - Knows something is wrong but too paranoid to act
- **[[Original Glaucus]]** - Imprisoned but still fighting mentally

### Unknowing Associates
- **[[Marina Red Tide Coralheart - Aquabyssos]]** - Suspects something but unsure
- **[[Parliament Loyalists]]** - Still believe he's the original

## Shadow Abilities

### Unique Powers (As Shadow)
- **Shadow Step:** Teleport 30 ft through darkness (3/day)
- **Darkness Vision:** See perfectly in magical darkness
- **Shadow Speech:** Communicate silently with other shadows
- **Memory Drain:** Touch attack to steal recent memories (1/day)

### Weaknesses
- **Light Vulnerability:** Bright light causes pain (disadvantage on attacks)
- **True Sight:** Reveals his shadow nature
- **Original's Will:** Sometimes influenced by imprisoned original's strong emotions

## Current Schemes

### Immediate Goals
1. Pass the Shadow Citizenship Act (tomorrow's vote)
2. Identify party as threat or asset
3. Prevent discovery of imprisoned original
4. Facilitate Shadow Duchess's arrival

### Long-term Plans

## Hooks & Quests

## Secrets & GM Notes

### Critical Information
1. **The Switch:** Happened at night exactly 21 days ago
2. **The Original:** Imprisoned in Memory Meadow kelp, slowly being forgotten
3. **The Tell:** His shadow moves 0.5 seconds before he does
4. **The Fear:** Terrified of true sunlight (would destroy him)
5. **The Weakness:** Saying original's true name three times causes pain

### How to Portray
- Always laughing at the wrong moments

### If Discovered

- **Phase 2:** Attempt to bargain with information
