## Description
This creature appears to be a dead, moss-covered tree, with bare, tangled branches stretching toward the sky. Often living in the shade of larger trees or in the wasteland of a destroyed or burned-over forest, lightning treants are strange, angry creatures whose powers and talents are almost elemental in nature. Especially twisted, stunted examples of this creature have been confused with shambling mounds, but lightning treants are much larger, and the mossy vegetation covering them is only a thin layer over their hard, barklike flesh.

While treants are generally willing to talk to strangers, hear what they have to say, and consider their requests or their plight, lightning treants tend to attack first and never ask questions at all. These creatures can be a serious bane to travelers who must cross the lightning treants’ territory, especially those who don’t recognize the nature of the danger facing them.

Lightning treants have an inherent hatred of all humanoids. Anyone armed with an axe is especially likely to anger them and incite them to violence just by being in their neighborhood. If combat goes against them, lightning treants will happily toss lightning at each other, to gain its healing benefits.
