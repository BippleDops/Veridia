# Power Word Stun
You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is [[stunned]]. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

The [[stunned]] target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect ends.
