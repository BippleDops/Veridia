--- # Abjuration School of Magic

*The Art of Protection, Banishment, and Magical Barriers* > *"In the crushing depths where existence itself is an act of defiance against the void, abjuration becomes not merely protective magic but the very foundation of civilization. Every barrier we raise, every ward we weave, is a declaration that mortal will can stand against cosmic indifference."*

In underwater civilizations where pressure, void influence, and cosmic forces constantly threaten mortal existence, abjuration has evolved far beyond simple defensive casting to become a sophisticated system of reality stabilization and consciousness protection. The school's principles center on the manipulation of magical forces to create barriers, dispel unwanted effects, and banish harmful entities or influences. Abjuration magic operates through the fundamental understanding that magical energy can be shaped into protective patterns that resist external forces, whether physical, magical, or psychological in nature. In [[Aquabyssos]], abjuration has developed unique characteristics due to the environment's extreme conditions and proximity to cosmic forces. Practitioners have created specialized techniques for pressure protection, void resistance, and corruption prevention that have no equivalents in surface magic traditions. These innovations have made [[Aquabyssos]] abjuration magic among the most sophisticated and powerful protective systems known to mortal civilization. The school serves multiple vital functions in underwater society: protecting cities from crushing ocean pressure, shielding citizens from corruption exposure, maintaining barriers against hostile entities, and creating safe spaces where normal life can continue despite surrounding dangers. Without the constant application of abjuration magic, neither [[Aquabyssos]] nor its surface ally [[Aethermoor]] could survive the cosmic threats that define their worlds. ## Magical Theory and Principles Abjuration magic operates on the fundamental principle that magical energy can be organized into stable patterns that resist external forces and unwanted changes. These protective patterns function as filters that allow beneficial influences to pass while blocking harmful effects, creating controlled environments where mortal consciousness and physical form can be preserved. ### Core Theoretical Framework **Barrier Mechanics**: Abjuration barriers work by creating zones of stabilized magical energy that resist alteration. These zones can be calibrated to block specific types of effects - physical force, magical influence, psychic intrusion, or cosmic corruption - while allowing other forms of interaction to continue normally. **Resistance Patterns**: Protective spells create geometric patterns in magical energy that naturally oppose certain types of force or influence. The complexity and stability of these patterns determine the barrier's effectiveness and duration, with more sophisticated patterns providing stronger protection at the cost of greater magical energy expenditure. **Dispelling Theory**: The removal of unwanted magical effects operates through the principle of magical resoce disruption. Abjuration spells can be tuned to specific magical frequencies, causing target effects to lose coherence and dissolve when exposed to properly calibrated counter-resoce. **Banishment Mechanics**: The forced removal of entities operates through dimensional manipulation that creates localized space-time distortions. These distortions can push entities out of the current reality or transport them to predetermined locations, depending on the spell's configuration and the caster's expertise. ### Underwater Adaptations **Pressure Integration**: [[Aquabyssos]] abjuration incorporates ocean pressure as a component of protective barriers, using the natural crushing force of deep water to strengthen magical defenses. This technique creates barriers that become more powerful with increasing depth. **Void Resistance**: Specialized abjuration techniques have been developed to protect against cosmic void influence and corruption exposure. These protections work by creating reality anchors that maintain normal physics and consciousness patterns within protected areas. **Crystal Resoce**: The integration of crystalline formations into abjuration magic allows for more stable and long-lasting protective effects. Crystal-enhanced barriers can maintain themselves for extended periods and provide protection against types of damage that would overwhelm conventional magical defenses. ### Advanced Applications **Collective Protection**: Master abjurers can create protective effects that cover entire communities, sharing the magical burden among multiple casters and creating defenses that can withstand attacks that would destroy individual barriers. **Selective Permeability**: Advanced barriers can be configured to allow specific individuals, objects, or types of magical energy to pass while blocking everything else. This requires sophisticated magical programming and constant maintece by skilled practitioners. **Temporal Shielding**: The most advanced abjuration techniques can create barriers that protect against effects targeting the past or future, ensuring that protected individuals maintain consistent existence even when subjected to timeline manipulation. ### Role in Aquabyssos Society

Abjuration practitioners serve as the foundation of underwater civilization, maintaining the barriers and protections that allow normal life to continue in hostile environments. They staff essential positions including: - **City Ward Keepers**: Maintaining protective barriers around settlements
- **Corruption Specialists**: Treating and preventing supernatural influence
- **Depth Guardians**: Protecting expeditions to dangerous deep regions
- **Reality Wardens**: Monitoring and responding to cosmic threats ### Integration with Other Schools

Abjuration magic works synergistically with other magical traditions: - **With Evocation**: Creating barriers that channel destructive forces
- **With Transmutation**: Protective transformations and environmental adaptation
- **With Divination**: Early warning systems for emerging threats
- **With Enchantment**: Mental protections against psychic intrusion ### Training and Advancement

Abjuration study follows structured progressions: **Novice Level**: Basic barrier creation and simple dispelling
**Apprentice Level**: Environmental adaptation and corruption resistance
**Journeyman Level**: Advanced barrier configurations and selective protection
**Master Level**: Large-scale protective systems and reality stabilization
**Grandmaster Level**: Cosmic-scale defenses and dimensional manipulation ## Player-Facing Summary Î© System CLI spells school abjuration is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
