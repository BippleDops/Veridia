*100+ Paths to Power and Peril* ## üîß Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview Transformations represent fundamental changes to a character's nature‚Äîphysical, mental, or spiritual alterations that grant new abilities at the cost of humanity. Each transformation follows a progression path with increasing benefits and drawbacks. ### Transformation Points

Characters accumulate Transformation Points (TP) through exposure, choice, or curse. Every 10 TP advances to the next stage. ### Stages of Transformation

1. **Stage I - Awakening** (1-10 TP): Minor changes, easily hidden
2. **Stage II - Manifestation** (11-20 TP): Obvious alterations, social complications
3. **Stage III - Evolution** (21-30 TP): Major abilities, significant drawbacks
4. **Stage IV - Metamorphosis** (31-40 TP): Powerful but alienating
5. **Stage V - Transcendence** (41+ TP): Barely human, immense power ### ü¶† Parasite Transformations

*Symbiotic entities that grant power through biological fusion* ### üíé Crystal Transformations

*Mineral corruption spreading through body and soul* ### üåä Deep Mother Transformations

*Blessings and curses from the primordial depths* ### üîß Tech-Bio Transformations

*Fusion of flesh and ancient technology* ### üåÄ Elemental Transformations

*Becoming one with primal forces* ### üëÅÔ∏è Aberrant Transformations

*Mutations beyond natural law* ### Gaining Transformation Points **Voluntary Methods**:

- Ritual participation: 1d4 TP

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Transformation Compendium as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens‚Äîshifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind‚Äîthat herald change around Transformation Compendium. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Plot Hooks - An heirloom has gone missing and evil awakens
