# Heward's Handy Spice Pouch
*Wondrous item, common*  



This belt pouch appears empty and has 10 charges. While holding the pouch, you can take a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to expend 1 charge, name any nonmagical food seasoning (such as salt, pepper, saffron, or cilantro), and remove a pinch of the desired seasoning from the pouch. A pinch is enough to season a single meal. The pouch regains `1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn.
