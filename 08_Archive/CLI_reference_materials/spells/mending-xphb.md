# Mending
*cantrip, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (two lodestones)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage.

This spell can physically repair a magic item, but it can't restore magic to such an object.

## Player-Facing Summary

Mending xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of mending xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around mending xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties mending xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at mending xphb to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to mending xphb active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
