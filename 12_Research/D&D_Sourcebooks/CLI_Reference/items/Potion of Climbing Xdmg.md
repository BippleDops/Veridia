*Potion, common* - **Weight**: 0.5 lbs. When you drink this potion, you gain a [[Climb Speed Xphb]] equal to your [[Fly Speed Xphb]] for 1 hour. During this time, you have [[Advantage Xphb]] on Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) checks to climb. This potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 287.
