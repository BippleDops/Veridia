    "description": "Senator Cordelia Deepcurrent epitomizes the sophisticated power broker of Aquabyssos politics. Her elegant merfolk physique is enhanced by centuries of selective breeding among the political elite—scales that shimmer with an iridescent blue-green that seems to shift with her moods, and flowing fins that move with practiced grace even in the densest political waters.\n\nStanding 5'6\" with an aristocratic bearing, Cordelia adorns herself in the finest coral jewelry and silk garments that flow like water around her form. Her most distinctive feature is her voice—melodious and hypnotic, capable of swaying hearts and minds with equal ease. When she speaks in the Parliament chambers, even her enemies listen.\n\nShe represents the Deepcurrent District, the wealthiest area of Aquabyssos, where the most influential families maintain their ancestral coral mansions. Her political philosophy centers on maintaining Aquabyssos's independence while carefully managing the delicate relationship with surface dwellers and the growing shadow threat.",
