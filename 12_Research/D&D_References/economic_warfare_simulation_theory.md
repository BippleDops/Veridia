# Economic Warfare Simulation Theory

## Modeling Complex Economic Systems in TTRPG Environments

Research on implementing realistic economic manipulation and trade warfare mechanics.

### Multi-Layered Economic Model

**Layer 1: Individual Transactions**
- Personal wealth and spending patterns
- Local trade and service exchange
- Barter systems and favor trading
- Individual corruption and graft

**Layer 2: Organizational Economics**
- Faction resource management
- Guild monopolies and price controls
- Military financing and equipment costs
- Criminal organization profit streams

**Layer 3: Regional Markets**
- City-state trade balances
- Resource scarcity and abundance cycles  
- Transportation cost fluctuations
- Regional political stability effects

**Layer 4: Inter-Realm Commerce**
- Cross-realm trade route control
- Exchange rate manipulation
- Embargo and blockade warfare
- Cultural preference arbitrage

### Economic Warfare Taxonomy

**1. Market Manipulation** (35% of economic attacks):
- **Price Flooding**: Oversupply to crash competitor prices
- **Artificial Scarcity**: Hoarding to inflate demand
- **Quality Sabotage**: Damaging competitor reputation
- **Patent/Guild Lockouts**: Restricting access to techniques

**2. Infrastructure Attacks** (25% of economic attacks):
- **Trade Route Disruption**: Piracy, banditry, blockades
- **Production Sabotage**: Destroying facilities and equipment
- **Transportation Monopoly**: Controlling shipping and movement
- **Communication Interference**: Disrupting business coordination

**3. Political Economic Pressure** (20% of economic attacks):
- **Regulatory Capture**: Influencing laws to favor allies
- **Taxation Warfare**: Using government policy as weapon
- **Diplomatic Pressure**: Trade agreement manipulation
- **Currency Destabilization**: Attacking monetary systems

**4. Information Warfare** (20% of economic attacks):
- **Trade Secret Theft**: Industrial espionage operations
- **Market Intelligence**: Insider trading and information asymmetry
- **Reputation Destruction**: Propaganda and rumor campaigns
- **False Scarcity**: Misinformation about resource availability

### Resource Interdependency Mapping

**Aquabyssos Critical Resources:**
- **Pressure-forged Metals**: Deep mining operations, specialized techniques
- **Processed Air**: Life support systems, breathing apparatus manufacturing
- **Abyssal Pearls**: Depth cultivation, memory storage technology
- **Bio-luminescent Materials**: Deep creature harvesting, cultivation farms

**Aethermoor Critical Resources:**
- **Resonant Crystals**: High-altitude mining, harmonic amplification
- **Wind Essence**: Storm capture technology, movement magic
- **Cloud Water**: Precipitation harvesting, purification systems
- **Stellar Materials**: Sky forge operations, cosmic alignment timing

**Cross-Realm Dependencies:**
- Communication crystals require both realm materials
- Transportation vessels need hybrid technology
- Magical items often require dual-realm components
- Military equipment benefits from combined resources

### Economic Vulnerability Assessment

**Supply Chain Analysis:**
- Single points of failure in production chains
- Alternative source development possibilities
- Stockpile duration under blockade conditions
- Emergency substitution and rationing protocols

**Market Concentration Risks:**
- Monopolistic control over critical resources
- Geographic clustering of production facilities
- Workforce specialization and training bottlenecks
- Technology transfer and knowledge dependencies

### Player Impact Mechanics

**Economic Action Categories:**
- **Direct Intervention**: Physical disruption of trade activities
- **Market Participation**: Buying, selling, investing strategically
- **Political Influence**: Lobbying for favorable economic policies
- **Information Manipulation**: Spreading rumors, revealing secrets

**Consequence Scaling:**
- **Individual Level**: Personal wealth, reputation, access
- **Organizational Level**: Faction resources, alliance stability
- **Regional Level**: City prosperity, population happiness
- **Realm Level**: Political stability, military capacity

### Implementation Framework

Economic tracking models:
```python
class EconomicNode(BaseModel):
    name: str
    resource_type: str
    production_capacity: int
    current_output: int
    dependencies: List[str]  # Other nodes required for operation
    vulnerability_factors: List[str]  # Points of potential disruption
    political_control: str  # Which faction controls this node
    market_connections: List[str]  # Where output flows
    
class TradeRoute(BaseModel):
    name: str
    start_location: str
    end_location: str
    transported_goods: List[str]
    security_level: ThreatLevel
    political_status: str  # open, restricted, embargoed, contested
    transit_time: int
    cost_modifiers: Dict[str, float]  # factors affecting price
```

### Simulation Mechanics

**Price Fluctuation System:**
- Base prices modified by supply/demand ratios
- Political stability modifiers (-50% to +200%)
- Seasonal and environmental effects (Â±25%)
- Player action consequences (variable impact)

**Economic Warfare Resolution:**
- Initiative system for economic actions
- Success/failure with multiple outcome possibilities
- Escalation mechanics and response opportunities
- Long-term consequence tracking
