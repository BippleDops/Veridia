# High Tidecaller Nerissa Deepcurrent

## Description

Nerissa appears ageless, though she has ruled for nearly two centuries. Her silver hair flows constantly as if underwater even in air pockets, and her skin has a subtle pearl-like shimmer. She wears robes woven from crystallized water that shift and flow with her movements. Her eyes change color with her emotions - deep blue when calm, storm green when angered, grey when sorrowful.

## Background

Born into the Oracle bloodline that predicted the Great Submersion, Nerissa was raised from birth to lead Aquabyssos. She witnessed the last days of the surface empire through inherited memories and carries the weight of three thousand years of isolation. Her grandmother was the last Oracle to speak with [[Emperor Thalassius the Wise]] before his sacrifice.
