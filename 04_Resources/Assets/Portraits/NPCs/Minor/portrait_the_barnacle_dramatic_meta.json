    "description": "Crust Deepmeld represents the ultimate evolution of symbiotic adaptation in Aquabyssos's deepest trenches. What was once a typical merfolk has become a living ecosystem, his body serving as host to hundreds of different sea creatures that have formed a permanent, mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nStanding 5'8\" but appearing much bulkier due to his living armor, Crust's original merfolk features are barely visible beneath layers of barnacles, coral, sea anemones, and other organisms. His skin has taken on a mottled gray-green hue, and bioluminescent patches pulse rhythmically across his form. Most striking are his eyes, which have adapted to complete darkness and now glow with an eerie blue light.\n\nHis movements are deliberate and somewhat mechanical, as if coordinating the actions of his many symbiotic partners requires conscious effort. When he speaks, his voice carries harmonic undertones from the creatures living within his throat and chest cavity.\n\nCrust dwells in the Symbiosis Depths, an area of the deep ocean where the boundaries between individual organisms have broken down entirely. Here, entire ecosystems exist as single entities, and the concept of \"self\" becomes fluid and negotiable.",
