## Quest Overview

Several lesser nobles from [[Crystalhaven have vanished after attending "[Cultural Exchange]]" events at [[Drowned Embassy]]. [[Shield|Captain Lyanna Bright[Shield]] suspects foul play but cannot legally investigate due to diplomatic immunity. [[The Party must uncover the truth while navigating international incidents and discovering a threat greater than anyone imagined.

## [Quest Giver]]

**[[Captain Lyanna Brightshield** approaches the party unofficially, as official channels are blocked by diplomatic protocols.

## Background

Three nobles - Lord Aldric Wavecrest, Lady Marea Shelworth, and Sir Donnel Clearwater - attended Embassy events over the past two months and haven't been seen since. [Korvin Blacktide]]]] claims they left safely, but their families report strange dreams of drowning and whispered words in unknown languages.

### Primary Objectives

1. Investigate the disappearances without violating diplomatic immunity
2. Discover the fate of the missing nobles
3. Uncover the true purpose of [[The Drowned Embassy
4. Decide whether to expose, stop, or ally with the conspiracy

### The Noble's Fate

The nobles are alive but being transformed into Deep Heralds in the Embassy's flooded cells. They're nearly complete - in 3 days, they'll be sent back as sleeper agents.

### The Blackmail Web

[Queen Seraphina]] [[Lumengarde]] knew about the kidnappings but is being blackmailed by Korvin, who has [[Evidence of her corruption. She's been providing him with information about crystal defenses.

### The Greater Threat

The missing nobles are part of a ritual to open the Deep Gate. Their bloodlines are tied to [Ancient Pacts]] that seal the boundary between realms. Once transformed, their corrupted blood will break these seals.

### The Goldspire Connection

[[Zephyr Goldwhisper and the Confederacy know about the threat and are prepared to use their  Bombs to destroy the entire [Embassy District]] if necessary, casualties included.

## DM Secrets

> [!warning] [[Timeline]] Pressure
> - Day 1-2: Investigation phase, gathering clues
> - Day 3: Transformation completes if not stopped
> - Day 4: Sleeper agents activated or Deep Gate ritual begins
> - Day 5: Either invasion begins or Goldspire implements scorched earth

> [!danger] The Moral Dilemma
> The nobles can be saved, but they've already been partially transformed. Saving them means they'll carry [[Aquabyssos]] corruption forever, potentially spreading it. Killing them prevents the invasion but murders innocents. Letting them transform might be the only way to learn Aquabyssos's true plans.

> [!info] Hidden Ally
> Tidecaller Nerissa, Korvin's attaché, is having doubts about the plan. She was once from Aethermoor and still has family in [[Port Meridian. She can be turned with the right approach.

## Player-Facing Summary

The Tide Rises is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of The Tide Rises as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Tide Rises.

## [DM_Notes]]

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
