## Overview

The Order of the Sunken Crown is a secretive organization dedicated to preserving the memory and recovering the artifacts of an ancient underwater kingdom that was destroyed in a cataclysmic event predating the founding of Aquabyssos. Members believe they are guardians of a rightful claim to underwater rulership and work to gather evidence of their kingdom's former glory.

## Historical Background

Founded by survivors and descendants of the lost kingdom, the Order has operated in secret for centuries, slowly gathering artifacts and knowledge while avoiding persecution by Aquabyssos authorities who view them as potential threats.

## Adventure Hooks
