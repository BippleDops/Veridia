# Merchant's Scale
*Adventuring gear*  


- **Cost**: 5 gp
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.

## Player-Facing Summary

Merchants scale is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of merchants scale as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around merchants scale.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties merchants scale to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at merchants scale to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to merchants scale active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
