# Break Limb (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a broken animal bone)

**Duration**: Until healed


## Effects
You touch a creature’s limb. The creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature’s bone breaks and it takes 2d10 force damage on a failed saving throw; on a suc-cess, it takes the damage but its limb doesn’t break.

Depending on the limb, it takes one to six months to heal naturally. A *lesser restoration* spell or any healing spell of 4th level or higher will heal it immediately.
