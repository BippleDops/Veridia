# Pathfinder's Greataxe

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Greataxe, Melee Weapon, Martial Weapon

**Rarity:** unknown (magic)

**Weight**: 7 lbs.

**Damage:** 1d12 slashing

## Description

When you wield this +1 greataxe, you always know the way to the nearest passage leading from underground toward the surface, as well as the approximate depth the axe is underground. 

**Heavy.** Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

**Two-Handed.** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
