# Captain Trawl Netcaster

*The deep-runner who's sailed every current and survived every depth*

> [!figure] Portrait
> ![NPC Portrait](04_Resources/Assets/Generated/Portraits/captain-trawl-netcaster.png)

## Overview

Captain Trawl Netcaster is a legendary submarine captain whose knowledge of Aquabyssos's hidden currents and secret passages is unmatched. Having spent forty years navigating the dangerous depths, he's one of the few who can pilot through the Void Zones, navigate the Pressure Maelstroms, and find safe harbor in the lawless Depths Between. His submarine, the "Deep Runner," is as much a character as he is—a patchwork vessel held together by barnacles, prayers, and sheer stubbornness.

What sets Trawl apart from other captains isn't just his navigational genius but his network of contacts in every port, legal or otherwise. He's transported everyone from Deep Mother cultists to Parliament officials, maintaining strict neutrality that's earned him both universal respect and constant danger. His policy is simple: pay the fare, keep the peace aboard his vessel, and he'll get you anywhere in Aquabyssos—no questions asked.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
- **Race**: Human (Depth-Adapted, Stage 3)
- **Age**: 67 years, looks older due to pressure exposure
- **Height**: 5'10", slightly hunched from years at the helm
- **Build**: Wiry and weathered, deceptively strong
- **Distinguishing Features**: Pressure scars creating a web pattern across his skin, one eye replaced with a depth-sensing crystal, fingers webbed to the second knuckle
- **Typical Attire**: Ancient captain's coat covered in depth badges, pressure suit underneath, always wearing his "lucky" kelp-rope belt

### Mannerisms
- **Voice**: Gravelly from years of pressure changes, speaks in navigation metaphors
- **Gestures**: Constantly checking invisible instruments, taps fingers in sonar patterns
- **Quirks**: Never looks directly at anyone while speaking, always listening to his ship's sounds

## For the Table

### First Meeting (Read Aloud)
> *The captain doesn't look up from his charts as you approach, his crystal eye gleaming with an inner light that sees depths beyond normal vision. His fingers trace currents on maps that seem to move on their own, showing routes that shouldn't exist. When he finally speaks, his voice carries the weight of every league he's traveled: "I don't care who you are or what you're running from. My only questions are: where to, and can you pay? The Deep Runner goes places other ships can't even dream of reaching—but dreams down here tend to have teeth."*

### Quick Roleplay Guide
- **Motivation**: To sail every current and chart every depth before he dies
- **Personality**: Gruff, professional, secretly sentimental
- **Speaking Style**: Short sentences, navigation metaphors, never says "impossible"
- **Topics They'll Discuss**: Routes, depths, ship maintenance, old adventures
- **Topics They'll Avoid**: Passenger details, his family, what he's seen in the Void

### The Three Things
1. **Secret**: He's dying from pressure sickness and has maybe a year left
2. **Desire**: To find the legendary "Current to Everywhere" before he dies
3. **Fear**: That his ship will outlive him and fall into the wrong hands

### Interaction Outcomes
- **If PCs befriend**: Offers discount rates, shares secret routes, teaches navigation
- **If PCs antagonize**: Blacklists them from his network, spreads word to other captains
- **If PCs ignore**: Continues his routes, may transport their enemies
- **If PCs kill**: The Deep Runner's AI takes revenge, his network hunts the party

## Background

### History
Started as a net-mender's son in the Shallow Ports, Trawl stowed away on a cargo sub at age 12. He worked his way up from bilge cleaner to navigator to captain, earning the Deep Runner in a card game he still claims was "mostly honest." Over four decades, he's survived three wars, seven krakens, and countless pressure storms.

### Current Situation
Running regular routes between major cities while secretly searching for the mythical "Current to Everywhere"—a legendary passage said to connect all parts of Aquabyssos instantly. His pressure sickness is getting worse, and he's training his niece Marina as his successor, though she doesn't know about his condition.

## DM Notes

### Running This NPC
- **Core Concept**: Gruff exterior hiding deep knowledge and deeper fears
- **Key Decisions**: Who to trust with his condition, who inherits his ship
- **Flexibility**: Can be mentor, transportation, or quest giver as needed

### Secrets Within Secrets
The Deep Runner is actually a living creature, a symbiotic organism that bonds with its captain. Trawl's sickness comes from the bond weakening as the creature prepares to reproduce. The "Current to Everywhere" is actually the creature's spawning ground.

### Alternative Interpretations
- Make him immortal, cursed to sail forever
- He's actually multiple people sharing one identity
- The ship is controlling him, not the other way around

### Voice Notes
Speak slowly, pause to listen to imaginary sounds. Use phrases like "the currents say," "by my depth," "that way lies pressure." Never commit to certainty—"might be," "could happen," "seen stranger."
