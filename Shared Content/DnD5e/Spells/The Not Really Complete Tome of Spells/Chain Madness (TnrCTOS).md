# Chain Madness (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *9th-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of brain matter from a mind flayer)

**Duration**: Until dispelled


## Effects
You pick a creature within range that you can see and that has an Intelligence of 5 or higher. Over the next 48 hours, that creature will begin showing the effects of insanity: the DM can roll first on the short-term insanity table, then the long-term table, then the in-definite-length table (*Dungeon Masterâ€™s Guide,* p.258) to determine the individual effects.

After one week, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the creature regains sanity. On a failure, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and its hit point total is reduced by that amount, and it remains in-sane for another week. At the end of that week, it must make another saving throw. This continues until the creature succeeds a saving throw or its hit point total is reduced to 0 hit points (at which case it dies).

After this creature has been infected for 6 hours, it has the potential to spread the mad-ness through physical, skin-to-skin contact. Each creature it touches must make a Wis-dom saving throw or contract the madness. If these secondary victims touch another creature, they have the potential to pass on the madness as well, but the tertiary (and later) victims have advantage on their saving throw.
