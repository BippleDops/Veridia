## Description
Some say my [[Furnace Wagon|furnace wagon]] is too dangerous, but I only heard of one person who burned to death. So, if you dont have an ox or ass and fear of death by fire but still want a wagon, I have a hand wagon. 

Men are poor beasts of burden, with two legs rather than four and the fear of tipping over always there. I didnt want a walker before the wagon to hold his own weight and pull the wagons and not stumble. So my hand wagon has the rider sit comfortable and pull on loops, using his weight to pull his weight. The work is like pulling himself from a seat, over and over for hours.

## Additional Details
can propel own weight and drivers weight at ¼ drivers str in speed and for drivers Con in rounds over level ground; extra passenger up to 200 lb halves speed; must be pushed across bumpy ground or up inclines more than 5%
