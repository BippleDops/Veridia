**Complexity**: Moderate
**Purpose**: Enhance gameplay in specific situations

## Description

03_Mechanics/CLI/books/players-handbook-2024/02-chapter-1-playing-the-game#Advantage/Disadvantage provides a structured approach to handling specific game situations that benefit from additional mechanical depth. This system integrates with existing D&D 5e rules while adding meaningful choices and consequences.

## Core Mechanics

### Basic Resolution
The fundamental process works as follows:

1. **Trigger**: Specific situation arises requiring this mechanic
2. **Setup**: Establish parameters and stakes
3. **Action**: Players make choices using the system
4. **Resolution**: Determine outcomes based on rolls and decisions
5. **Consequences**: Apply results to ongoing game

### Key Components

#### Primary Mechanic
- **Roll Type**: d20 + modifiers vs. DC
- **Difficulty Range**: DC 10-25 based on challenge
- **Modifiers**: Ability scores, proficiency, circumstances

#### Resource Management
- **Points/Uses**: Limited resource to track
- **Recovery**: How resources regenerate
- **Costs**: What actions consume resources

#### Time Factor
- **Action Economy**: How it fits in combat/exploration
- **Duration**: How long effects last
- **Frequency**: How often it can be used

## Detailed Rules

### Prerequisites
Before using this mechanic:
- Specific conditions must be met
- Players must have certain capabilities
- DM establishes parameters

### Process

#### Step 1: Initiation
Determine when and how the mechanic activates:
- Player-triggered vs. DM-triggered
- Required declarations or preparations
- Cost or risk assessment

#### Step 2: Execution
The actual mechanical process:
1. Declare intended outcome
2. Commit resources (if applicable)
3. Make necessary rolls
4. Apply modifiers and advantages
5. Compare to target numbers

#### Step 3: Results
Determining success and degree:
- **Critical Success** (20 or beat DC by 10+): Exceptional outcome
- **Success** (Meet or beat DC): Intended result achieved
- **Partial Success** (Fail by 5 or less): Limited success with complication
- **Failure** (Fail by 6+): Intended result not achieved
- **Critical Failure** (1 or fail by 10+): Significant negative consequence

### Modifiers & Advantages

#### Circumstantial Modifiers
- **Favorable conditions**: +2 to +5
- **Unfavorable conditions**: -2 to -5
- **Preparation**: Advantage on roll
- **Rushed/Pressured**: Disadvantage on roll

#### Character Abilities
- **Relevant proficiency**: Add proficiency bonus
- **Expertise**: Double proficiency bonus
- **Class features**: May provide unique benefits
- **Feats**: Could modify or enhance mechanic

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Use
*Scenario*: [Specific situation]
- Player declares intent
- DM sets DC 15
- Player rolls d20+5, gets 17
- Success achieved with described outcome

### Example 2: Complex Application
*Scenario*: [More complex situation]
- Multiple participants involved
- Extended challenge requiring multiple rolls
- Resource management element
- Partial successes building to completion

### Example 3: Failed Attempt
*Scenario*: [Failure situation]
- What went wrong
- Consequences of failure
- Recovery options
- Learning from failure

## Integration

How this mechanic works during combat:
- Action/bonus action/reaction cost
- Interaction with initiative
- Effects on combat dynamics

### With Exploration
Application during exploration:
- Time requirements
- Resource consumption
- Discovery opportunities
- Environmental interactions

### With Social Encounters
Using in social situations:
