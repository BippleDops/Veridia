## Special Traits
**Paralyzing Poison:** Every time a character is clawed by a feral undead cat, he or she must make a DC 8 Constitution saving throw. On the first failed save, the character becomes poisoned; on the second failed save, the character becomes restrained; and on the third failed save, the character becomes paralyzed. Each effect lasts for `dice: 1d6` x 10 minutes, and the lengths add together as the character's condition worsens.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The feral cat attacks twice with claws.

**Claw:** *Melee Weapon Attack*: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 1 slashing damage and the target creature must make a successful DC 8 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effect of paralyzing poison (see above).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Graveyards and ruins

**Organization**: Group (2–5) or pack (4–24)

## Description
Feral undead cats look like they were created by zombie-raising magic, but they are quite unlike mindless undead such as skeletons or zombies. These cats possess an animal cunning akin to that of ghouls (although with less intelligence overall), and they are not slow moving as zombies are. Like ghouls, they tend to form into packs. A lone undead cat is almost certainly scouting or keeping watch for a larger group.

Feral undead cats sometimes hide in plain sight by lying alongside the road, in ditches, along fencerows, or in abandoned buildings—places where people wouldn’t be surprised to see dead cats. The surprise comes when the cats leap onto the characters’ legs and backs with their filthy, razor-sharp claws extended. Malevolent witches and other evil spellcasters who sometimes need dead cats for their magic can be caught unaware by these creatures and overcome by their poison. The cats eat what they bring down, but slowly, while it’s still alive and paralyzed. They’ve been known to use one victim as bait to lure more victims into their territory.
