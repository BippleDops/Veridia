# Eversmoking Bottle
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/eversmoking-bottle.webp#right)


As a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action, you can open or close this bottle.

Opening the bottle causes thick smoke to billow out, forming a cloud that fills a 60-foot [Emanation](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) originating from the bottle. The area within the smoke is [Heavily Obscured](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/heavily-obscured-xphb.md).

Each minute the bottle remains open, the size of the [Emanation](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum size of 120 feet.

Closing the bottle causes the cloud to become fixed in place until it disperses after 10 minutes. A strong wind (such as that created by the [Gust of Wind](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/gust-of-wind-xphb.md) spell) disperses the cloud after 1 minute.
