# Alter Path (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (10-foot line)

**Components**: V, S, M (a knife blade, the straw from a broom, and a handful of peb-bles)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour


## Effects
When you cast this spell, you pick one of the following options:

♦ ***Clear Path.*** The road ahead of you to a distance of ten feet is cleared of debris as you walk, providing you with a easy path.

♦ ***Clutter Path.*** The road behind you is strewed with debris to a distance of ten feet, turning the path behind you into difficult terrain.

Only relatively light debris, such as light branches and gravel, is moved. Large obsta-cles such as fallen trees are unaffected.
