# Pier 7

![[04_Resources/Assets/Art/Lore/Pier_7.png|Pier 7 Portrait]]

## Summary
Pier 7 describes a turning current in history where choices about memory, depth, and sovereignty reshaped travel, trade, and ritual.

## Historical Context
- Origin: Scribal disputes escalated into pressure-lock conflicts.
- Spread: Merchant routes adopted secret signs to bypass tariffs; songs encoded depth-keys.
- Present: Competing narratives justify new taxes, oaths, and contraband routes.

## What It Means at the Table
- Investigation: On a lead toward old tariffs, players can extract schedules that reduce travel risks for a session.
- Social: Reciting the chapel oath grants advantage on one Persuasion check if honored afterward.
- Exploration: Recognizing encoded waystones reduces the chance of getting lost by one step.

## Threads and Revelations
- Records implicate agents tied to [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Lighthouse of Storms.md|The Lighthouse of Storms]].
- A rite echoes the activation cadence needed for [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/The Whispering Expanse.md|The Whispering Expanse]].
- Testimony suggests [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Elena Starweaver.md|Elena Starweaver]] financed a pivotal bribe.
