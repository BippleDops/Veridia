# Venomdust (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 month


## Effects
You create an ounce of highly toxic dust, which you can sprinkle on objects (or parts of an object) that are no larger than to 1 square foot. The *venomdust* adheres to the material and cannot be blown or washed off. It stays potent for 1 month.

A creature that touches an object with bare hands or thin gloves must make a Con-stitution saving throw. The creature takes 6d10 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 hour on a failure, or no damage but is poi-soned for 1 hour on a success.
