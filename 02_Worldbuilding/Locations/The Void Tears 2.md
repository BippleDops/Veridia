# The Void Tears
*Where Reality Bleeds Into Nothingness*

## Overview

The Void Tears represent one of the most terrifying and unpredictable phenomena in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor, appearing as spontaneous rifts in reality that create direct portals to the primordial void - the space between dimensions where existence itself ceases to have meaning. These reality breaches manifest primarily within [02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Crystalline Wastes]], though smaller tears have been documented throughout regions of high magical instability.

Unlike mere dimensional portals or planar rifts, Void Tears connect to absolute nothingness - not another plane or reality, but the fundamental absence of existence that underlies the multiverse. Matter, energy, magic, consciousness, and even concepts that approach these rifts are systematically unraveled and consumed, returning to the state of primordial void from which all things originally emerged.

The tears appear without warning, ranging from hairline fractures in reality barely visible to the naked eye, to massive chasms hundreds of feet across that devour entire landscapes. Each manifestation threatens not just individual lives, but the structural integrity of reality itself within the affected region.

## Formation & Nature

### Origin Theory
The leading theory among dimensional scholars suggests that Void Tears result from the extreme reality distortion created by [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Crystallization. When the catastrophic magical event rewrote the fundamental laws of physics across the Crystalline Wastes, it created "weak spots" in the fabric of reality itself.

**The Cascade Effect**: Initial crystal corruption destabilized local reality, creating microscopic void fractures that occasionally expand into full tears when exposed to additional magical stress or dimensional manipulation.

**The Resonance Factor**: Crystal formations throughout the Wastes sometimes achieve resonance frequencies that literally vibrate reality apart at the quantum level, opening pathways to the void between dimensions.

**The Consciousness Drain**: Some researchers believe that the collective trauma and despair generated by the Great Crystallization created "psychic vacuum zones" where the will to exist itself was so thoroughly destroyed that reality simply... stopped.

### Physical Characteristics
#### Appearance
- **Active Tears**: Perfect circles or irregular fractures of absolute blackness
- **Edge Definition**: Razor-sharp boundaries where reality simply ends
- **Visual Effect**: Light, magic, and matter visibly "fall into" the darkness without illuminating anything
- **Surrounding Distortion**: Reality becomes increasingly unstable within 50-100 feet of larger tears
- **Size Variation**: Range from pinprick holes to massive chasms over 100 feet in diameter

#### Manifestation Patterns
**Sudden Onset**: Most tears appear instantaneously without warning signs
**Gradual Expansion**: Some begin as tiny fractures and slowly grow over time
**Pulsing Behavior**: Active tears may rhythmically expand and contract
**Migration**: Smaller tears occasionally "drift" across the landscape
**Resonance Formation**: Multiple small tears sometimes merge into larger ones

## Categories & Classification

### Type I: Pinpoint Tears
- **Size**: Less than 1 foot diameter
- **Danger Level**: Moderate (localized consumption)
- **Duration**: Usually close within hours or days
- **Effects**: Consume small objects, create local reality distortion
- **Detection**: Often discovered only when objects begin disappearing

### Type II: Consumption Voids
- **Size**: 1-10 feet diameter
- **Danger Level**: High (threatens individuals and structures)
- **Duration**: Days to weeks before closure or expansion
- **Effects**: Systematically consume matter and energy in predictable patterns
- **Behavior**: May exhibit apparent "hunger" - actively pulling objects toward them

### Type III: Reality Chasms
- **Size**: 10-50 feet diameter
- **Danger Level**: Extreme (regional threat)
- **Duration**: Weeks to months, some appear permanent
- **Effects**: Massive consumption zones, reality distortion across wide areas
- **Impact**: Can devour entire buildings, cause reality storms

### Type IV: Dimensional Catastrophes
- **Size**: Over 50 feet diameter
- **Danger Level**: Apocalyptic (threatens entire regions)
- **Duration**: Potentially permanent without intervention
- **Effects**: Reality breakdown across miles, uncontrolled expansion
- **Rarity**: Only three documented cases in recorded history

### Special Classifications

#### Wandering Tears
Mobile void rifts that drift across landscapes, leaving trails of consumption in their wake. These tears seem to follow ley lines or areas of high magical concentration, suggesting some form of supernatural attraction to energy sources.

#### Resonance Clusters
Groups of smaller tears that appear simultaneously in geometric patterns, often forming triangles, hexagons, or more complex magical geometric shapes. The spaces between clustered tears become increasingly unstable.

#### Dormant Fractures
Sealed or inactive tears that appear as faint dark lines or scars in reality. While temporarily harmless, these can reopen under magical stress or dimensional pressure.

## Environmental Effects

### Immediate Consumption Zone
**Distance**: 0-10 feet from tear edge
**Effect**: Complete annihilation of matter and energy
**Process**: Objects don't burn, dissolve, or transform - they simply cease to exist
**Duration**: Instantaneous consumption upon contact
**Recovery**: Nothing that enters this zone can be retrieved

### Reality Distortion Field
**Distance**: 10-50 feet from tear edge (varies by tear size)
**Effects**:
- **Physical Laws Breakdown**: Gravity, thermodynamics, and electromagnetic forces become unreliable
- **Magical Interference**: Spells fail unpredictably, magical items malfunction
- **Temporal Anomalies**: Time flows irregularly, causing aging or youth effects
- **Spatial Warping**: Distances become meaningless, straight paths curve impossibly
- **Sensory Confusion**: Sight, sound, and other senses provide contradictory information

### Probability Chaos Zone
**Distance**: 50-200 feet from tear edge
**Effects**:
- **Impossible Events**: Statistically impossible outcomes become commonplace
- **Luck Fluctuations**: Extreme good and bad fortune alternates randomly
- **Causal Breakdown**: Effects occasionally precede their causes
- **Reality Echoes**: Past events sometimes repeat or overlay present circumstances
- **Existential Doubt**: Individuals begin questioning the nature of their own existence

## Game Mechanics (D&D 5e)

**Reality Storm**: Magic missile-like effect from dimensional instability (`dice: 3d4`+3 force damage)
**Temporal Echo**: Previous round's actions repeat automatically
**Probability Spike**: Roll on wild magic surge table each round

#### Tear-Spawned Entities
Some void tears occasionally spawn entities from the space between realities:

**Null Shades**: Humanoid-shaped absences that drain life force and memories
- AC 16, HP 45, Speed 30 ft (hover)
- Immune to physical damage, vulnerable to radiant damage
- Life Drain attack: Constitution save or lose `dice: 1d4` Constitution permanently

**Reality Wraiths**: Echoes of beings consumed by tears
- Retain appearance and memories of original person
- Desperately attempt to drag others into void to end their non-existence
- Phase in and out of reality unpredictably

**Void Stalkers**: Predatory entities that hunt along tear edges
- Invisible except when consuming prey
- Can phase through matter at will
- Instinctively drawn to magical energy and strong emotions

## Research & Study Attempts

### The Dimensional Observatory
**Location**: Heavily fortified research station 2 miles from the largest known tear
**Staff**: 50+ researchers, guards, and support personnel
**Purpose**: Long-term study of void tear behavior and containment methods
**Director**: [02_Worldbuilding/People/Professor Aldric Crystalweaver]], foremost expert on dimensional anomalies
