You will need to do some adjustment to resolve differences. ### Death Domain (Level 3) The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures. Deities such as [[dragonlance-chemosh-phb (deities), Myrkul, and Wee Jas are patrons of necromancers, death knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. Gods of the Death domain also embody murder ([Egyptian Anubis]], Bhaal, and Pyremius), pain (Iuz or Loviatar), disease or poison (Incabulos, Talona, or [[Dragonlance Morgion Phb), and the underworld ([Greek Hades]] and [[Norse Hel). At each indicated cleric level, add the listed spells to your spells prepared. They do not count towards your limit. **Death Domain Spells** | Cleric Level | Spells |

| 1st | [False Life Xphb]], [[Ray of Sickness Xphb |

| 9th | [antilife-shell-xphb (spells)]], [[Cloudkill Xphb |

^death-domain-spells ### Bonus Proficiency (Level 1) When the cleric chooses this domain at 1st level, he or she gains proficiency with martial weapons. ### Reaper (Level 1) At 1st level, the cleric learns one necromancy cantrip of his or her choice from any spell list. When the cleric casts a necromancy cantrip that normally targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. ### Channel Divinity: Touch of Death (Level 3) Starting at 2nd level, the cleric can use Channel Divinity to destroy another creature's life force by touch. When the cleric hits a creature with a melee attack, the cleric can use Channel Divinity to deal extra necrotic damage to the target. The damage equals 5 + twice his or her cleric level. ### Inescapable Destruction (Level 6) Starting at 6th level, the cleric's ability to channel negative energy becomes more potent. Necrotic damage dealt by the character's cleric spells and Channel Divinity options ignores resistance to necrotic damage. ### Improved Reaper (Level 17) Starting at 17th level, when the cleric casts a Necromancy spell of 1st through 5th-level that targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. If the spell consumes its material components, the cleric must provide them for each target. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Cleric xphb death domain dmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
