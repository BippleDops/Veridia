# Feather Token
*Wondrous Item, common*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This small metal disk is inscribed with the image of a feather. When you fall at least 20 feet while the token is on your person, you descend 60 feet per round and take no damage from falling. The token's magic is expended after you land, whereupon the disk becomes nonmagical.
