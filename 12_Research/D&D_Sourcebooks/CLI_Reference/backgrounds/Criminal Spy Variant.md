# Criminal (Spy) (Variant)
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 130. Available in the Basic Rules (2014)*  

- **Skill Proficiencies.** [[skills#Deception|Deception]], [[skills#Stealth|Stealth]]  
- **Tool Proficiencies.** One type of gaming set, [[thieves-tools-xphb (items)]]  
- **Equipment.** A [[Crowbar Xphb]], a set of dark [[common-clothes (items)]] including a hood, and a belt [[component-pouch-xphb (items)]] containing 15 gp  

Although your capabilities are not much different from those of a burglar or smuggler, you learned and practiced them in a very different context: as an espionage agent. You might have been an officially sanctioned agent of the crown, or perhaps you sold the secrets you uncovered to the highest bidder.

## Feature: Spy Contact

You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison to a network of other spies. You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you.

## Specialty

There are many kinds of criminals, and within a thieves' guild or similar criminal organization, individual members have particular specialties. Even criminals who operate outside of such organizations have strong preferences for certain kinds of crimes over others. Choose the role you played in your criminal life, or roll on the table below.

## Suggested Characteristics

Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.

`dice: [](criminal-spy-variant.md#^personality-trait)`

| dice: d8 | Personality Trait |
|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | I always have a plan for when things go wrong. |
| 2 | I am always calm, no matter what the situation. I never raise my voice or let my emotions control me. |
| 3 | The first thing I do in a new place is note the locations of everything valuableâ€”or where such things could be hidden. |
| 4 | I would rather make a new friend than a new enemy. |
| 5 | I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide. |
| 6 | I don't pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds. |
| 7 | The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can't do it. |
| 8 | I blow up at the slightest insult. |
^personality-trait

`dice: [](criminal-spy-variant.md#^ideal)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Honor. I don't steal from others in the trade. (Lawful) |
| 2 | Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them. (Chaotic) |
| 3 | Charity. I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need. (Good) |
| 4 | Greed. I will do whatever it takes to become wealthy. (Evil) |
| 5 | People. I'm loyal to my friends, not to any ideals, and everyone else can take a trip down the Styx for all I care. (Neutral) |
| 6 | Redemption. There's a spark of good in everyone. (Good) |
^ideal

`dice: [](criminal-spy-variant.md#^bond)`

| dice: d6 | Bond |
|----------|------|
| 1 | I'm trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor. |
| 2 | My ill-gotten gains go to support my family. |
| 3 | Something important was taken from me, and I aim to steal it back. |
| 4 | I will become the greatest thief that ever lived. |
| 5 | I'm guilty of a terrible crime. I hope I can redeem myself for it. |
| 6 | Someone I loved died because of a mistake I made. That will never happen again. |
^bond

`dice: [](criminal-spy-variant.md#^flaw)`

| dice: d6 | Flaw |
| 1 | When I see something valuable, I can't think about anything but how to steal it. |
| 2 | When faced with a choice between money and my friends, I usually choose the money. |
| 3 | If there's a plan, I'll forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll ignore it. |
| 4 | I have a 'tell' that reveals when I'm lying. |
| 5 | I turn tail and run when things look bad. |
| 6 | An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I'm okay with that. |

## Player-Facing Summary

Criminal spy variant is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of criminal spy variant as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around criminal spy variant.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
