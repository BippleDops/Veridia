# Staff of Charming
*Staff, weapon, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/staff-of-charming.webp#right)

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[item-properties#Versatile|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff has 10 charges. While holding the staff, you can use any of its properties:

- **Cast Spell.** You can expend 1 of the staff's charges to cast [[charm-person-xphb|Charm Person]], [[command-xphb|Command]], or [[comprehend-languages-xphb|Comprehend Languages]] from it using your spell save DC.  
- **Reflect Enchantment.** If you succeed on a saving throw against an Enchantment spell that targets only you, you can take a [[reaction-xphb|Reaction]] to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.  
- **Resist Enchantment.** If you fail a saving throw against an Enchantment spell that targets only you, you can turn your failed save into a successful one. You can't use this property of the staff again until the next dawn.  

## Regaining Charges

The staff regains `1d8 + 2` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll `d20`. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust and is destroyed.
