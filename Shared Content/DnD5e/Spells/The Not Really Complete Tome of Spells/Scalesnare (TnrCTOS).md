# Scalesnare (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a live snake)

**Duration**: 1 day


## Effects
You throw a snake at a target. Make a ranged spell attack to hit. On a hit, the snake turns into a magical, grappling tentacle that restrains the target (escape DC equal to your spell save DC).

The snake is an object with AC 15, hit points equal to your hit point total; if it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. The snake is immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slash-ing damage from nonmagical weapons.
