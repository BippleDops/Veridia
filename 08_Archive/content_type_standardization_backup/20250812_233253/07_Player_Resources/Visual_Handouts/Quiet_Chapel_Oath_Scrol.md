# Quiet Chapel Oath Scroll

## In-World Text
A document circulated among locals and travelers. Its edges are smudged with salt and ink. The handwriting shifts, suggesting multiple authors or hurried copyists.

> Clerk's Note: Stamped and recorded at Port Meridian under the Tide-Quartermaster's seal.

## Visual Cues
- Paper: water-warped, salt stains, faint coral fiber inclusions
- Ink: stormglass sheen; letters shimmer at angles
- Markings: seals, thumbprints, tally marks

## Usable Table Info
- Names, dates, and codes that can be entered into checks or puzzles
- One immediate hook: present this to bypass one routine obstacle, then mark spent

## GM Margin
- If forged: DC 15 Investigation to detect; failure moves story forward with suspicion clock +1
