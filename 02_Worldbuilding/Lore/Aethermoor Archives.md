# Aethermoor Archives

![[04_Resources/Assets/Art/Lore/Aethermoor_Archives.png|Aethermoor Archives Portrait]]

## Summary

Aethermoor Archives describes a turning current in history where choices about memory, depth, and sovereignty reshaped travel, trade, and ritual.

## Historical Context

- Origin: Scribal disputes escalated into pressure-lock conflicts.
- Spread: Merchant routes adopted secret signs to bypass tariffs; songs encoded depth-keys.
- Present: Competing narratives justify new taxes, oaths, and contraband routes.

## What It Means at the Table

- Investigation: On a lead toward old tariffs, players can extract schedules that reduce travel risks for a session.
- Social: Reciting the chapel oath grants advantage on one Persuasion check if honored afterward.
- Exploration: Recognizing encoded waystones reduces the chance of getting lost by one step.

## Threads and Revelations

- Records implicate agents tied to [[The Sunken Library of Thalassius]].
- A rite echoes the activation cadence needed for [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]].
- Testimony suggests [[Vex Shadowthorn]] financed a pivotal bribe.
