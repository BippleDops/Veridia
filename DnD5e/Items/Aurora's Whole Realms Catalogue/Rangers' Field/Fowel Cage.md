## Description
Most natural animals are trainable to some degree, growing hostile only when provoked. With our variously-sized cages, rangers can keep animals either for taming or training. Our fowlersâ€™ cages (8 gp) are built of sturdy bamboo from Hungtse and provide enough space for creatures from tit-mouse to falcon sizes. The cages are easily collapsible into flat and light-weight panels that fit snugly on our equipment pack. For larger creatures, see our offerings of [[Collars|collars]] and [[Leashes|leashes]].

## Additional Details
Wt 2 lb (bamboo); require 1 turn to set up, collapse; proper cage provides +1 to Animal training checks for taming or training
