# A Day in Aquabyssos
*Life Beneath the Waves: Daily Rhythms of the Deep*

## Overview

Life in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos flows with the natural rhythms of the ocean depths, shaped by pressure cycles, bioluminescent patterns, and the eternal dance of current and tide. The underwater realm's inhabitants have evolved complex daily routines that blend practicality with the unique challenges and opportunities of their aquatic existence.

## The Aquabyssos Day Cycle

### Current Tides (6 Hours Each)
Rather than a 24-hour day, Aquabyssos follows the **Great Current Cycle** - four 6-hour tides that govern daily life:

2. **High Tide** (Morning): 0600-1200 hours
3. **Falling Tide** (Afternoon): 1200-1800 hours
4. **Low Tide** (Evening/Night): 1800-2400 hours

### Pressure Bell System
Every district uses **Pressure Bells** - resonant crystalline structures that emit specific frequencies to mark time divisions:
- **Deep Chime**: Start of each tide (4 times per day)
