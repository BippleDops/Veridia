- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pearl worth 100+ GP)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous You touch an object throughout the spell's casting. If the object is a magic item or some other magical object, you learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires [[attunement-xphb (variant-rules), and how many charges it has, if any. You learn whether any ongoing spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn that spell's name. If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn which ongoing spells, if any, are currently affecting it. **Classes**: [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 287.
