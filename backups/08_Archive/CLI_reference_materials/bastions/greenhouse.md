# Greenhouse
*Level 9 Bastion facility*  

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Space**: Roomy (16 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 1
- **Order**: harvest

A Greenhouse is an enclosure where rare plants and fungi are nurtured in a controlled climate.

## Fruit of Restoration

One plant in your Greenhouse has three magical fruits growing on it. Any creature that eats one of these fruits gains the benefit of a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/lesser-restoration-xphb|Lesser Restoration]] spell. Fruits that aren't eaten within 24 hours of being picked lose their magic. The plant replaces all picked fruits daily at dawn, and it can't be transplanted without killing it.

## Harvest Options

When you issue the "Harvest" order to this facility, choose one of the following options:

- **Harvest.** Healing Herbs. You commission the facility's hireling to create a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-greater-healing-xdmg|Potion of Healing (greater)]] made from healing herbs. The work takes 7 days and costs no money.  
- **Harvest.** Poison. You commission the facility's hireling to extract one application of a poison from rare plants or fungi. Choose the type of poison from the following options: [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/assassins-blood-xdmg|Assassin's Blood]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/malice-xdmg|Malice]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/pale-tincture-xdmg|Pale Tincture]], or [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/truth-serum-xdmg|Truth Serum]]. See ""Poison"" in "chapter 3" for each poison's effect. Once harvested, the poison can be contained in a vial. The work takes 7 days and costs no money.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of greenhouse as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around greenhouse.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties greenhouse to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at greenhouse to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to greenhouse active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
