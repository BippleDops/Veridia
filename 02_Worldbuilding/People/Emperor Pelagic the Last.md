Legends speak of Emperor Pelagic the Last as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Emperor Pelagic the Last.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Emperor Pelagic the Last to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
