## Description
Vulchlings are a malevolent race of avian creatures akin to vultures, but larger and much more intelligent. Their faces are clearly birdlike, yet something about them seems oddly human.

Vulchlings are scavengers and predators. They hunt any creatures they believe they can kill. They tend to avoid hunting intelligent humanoids— not from any sense of ethics or revulsion over killing intelligent beings, but simply because intelligent prey is more dangerous.

Vulchlings can be found in the company of harpies and vrocks, sometimes as servitors and sometimes as mercenaries. Most of their time is spent in their large nests hidden deep inside the earth.

Vulchlings always attack from ambush if possible. They hide on shadowy ledges high up on cavern walls, then dive silently onto unsuspecting prey.

## Additional Details
The vulchling originally appeared in the First Edition Monster Manual II (© TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983) and is used by permission.
