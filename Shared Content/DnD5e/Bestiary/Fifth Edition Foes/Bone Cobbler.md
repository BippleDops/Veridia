## Special Traits
**Animate Bones (1/Day):** Once per day as an action, a bone cobbler can animate up to five skeletal statues within 30 feet of itself. These creatures use the stat block of skeletons, though their forms and structures do not need to resemble humanoids or anything remotely humanoid. The skeletal statues remain animated until destroyed, until the bone cobbler wills them back into statues, or for 24 hours.

**Bonestripping:** A bone cobbler can strip all the flesh from the corpse of a Medium creature in three minutes using its claws and hammers. For each size category larger or smaller than Medium a corpse is, add or subtract 1 minute. Once stripped, the bone cobbler devours the flesh and collects the victim's bones to use in its sculptures. A creature slain in this manner can be brought back to life only by a wish or resurrection spell.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The bone cobbler attacks twice with light hammers or twice with claws.

**Claws:*** Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d4+2`) slashing damage.

**Light Hammer:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d4+2`) bludgeoning damage.

**Light Hammer (thrown):** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 20 ft./60 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d4+2`) bludgeoning damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Subterranean

**Organization**: Solitary or gang (2â€“5)

## Description
The bone cobbler is a tattered and desiccated humanoid that is easily mistaken for a zombie. The bone cobbler, however, is not undead, but is thought to originate from another plane or dimension of existence. It delights in slaying opponents, stripping the flesh from their bones, and then assembling the bones of various creatures into nightmarish sculptures of creatures that never existed.

Bone cobblers stand 6 feet tall.
