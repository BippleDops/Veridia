## Overview
The Stolen Anvil incident involves the theft of the legendary Deepforge Anvil, a magical smithing tool capable of creating underwater weapons and artifacts of unprecedented quality. The anvil's disappearance has crippled the city's crafting industry and created a black market for inferior goods.
