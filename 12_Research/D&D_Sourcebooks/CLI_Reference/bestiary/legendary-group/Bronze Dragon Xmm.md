## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing an adult or ancient bronze dragon's lair is changed by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Buoying Currents.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair that lack a [[swim-speed-xphb|Swim Speed]] ignore the extra cost of movement while swimming.  
- **Sun and Storms.** While in its lair, the dragon can cast [[control-weather-xphb|Control Weather]], requiring no Material components and using the same spellcasting ability as its Spellcasting action. When casting the spell this way, the dragon can control the weather within 1 mile of its lair, regardless if the dragon is inside or outside.  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
