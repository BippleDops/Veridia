## Description
Assassin bugs are predatory insects that feed on the blood and tissue of living creatures. Actively hunting or passively waiting for its prey, an assassin bug is a formidable killing machine that has few enemies.

Although often encountered alone, assassin bugs are communal creatures. Nests containing up to 20 creatures have been found. Most nests contain at least one female of mating age. During mating season, the female deposits a sticky clutch of `dice: 2d4` eggs in a narrow nest scraped into the forest floor. The eggs hatch within two weeks. Newborn assassin bugs look exactly like their adult counterparts (other than being smaller). An assassin bug goes through several growth stages before finally reaching adult stage within one year.

An assassin bug stands 5 feet tall. Its body is segmented, and most are dull brownish black (though red and black or even yellowish-brown assassin bugs have been reported). Its front, curved legs (called jackknife legs) are black and covered in tiny hairs that aid it in climbing as well as capturing its prey. An assassin bug has two pairs of wings that it keeps folded against its back when not flying.

Depending on the disposition of the assassin bug, it might wait in ambush for prey to come close, or it might actively seek out live food. In either case, when a victim is within range, the assassin bug leaps to the attack, attempting to grapple its prey so it can inject its organ-dissolving saliva. A victim that dies is kept in the assassin bug’s lair for several weeks as it and any others in the nest slurp up the liquefied internals of the victim.
