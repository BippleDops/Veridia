# The Deep Mother
*She Who Dreams Beneath, The Primordial Womb, Mother of Shadows and Sorrows*

## Overview
The Deep Mother is the primordial entity believed to slumber in the deepest trenches beneath [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]. According to ancient [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Aboleth Prime Yoth|02 Worldbuilding/People/Aboleth Prime Yoth]] memories and the teachings of [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Drowned Prophets|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/The Drowned Prophets]], she is the source of all water, darkness, and dreams in the world. Her endless slumber generates the reality of Aquabyssos itself—the underwater realm exists within her dreaming consciousness.

## Divine Portfolio
- **Domains**: Dreams, Depths, Shadows, Memory, Transformation, Sorrow
- **Sacred Elements**: Dark water, pressure, luminescent creatures, shadow
- **Holy Symbol**: A spiral of darkness with a single eye at its center
- **Favored Offerings**: Memories, final breaths, shadow essence, pearls of sorrow

## Creation Mythology

### The First Dream
Before time, before light, there was only the Deep Mother floating in the primordial void. Her first dream created water, her second created darkness, and her third created the potential for life. As she descended into deeper slumber, her dreams became more complex, birthing:

1. **The Depths**: Physical layers of reality corresponding to sleep stages
2. **The Aboleths**: First children, born from her memories
3. **Shadows**: Fragments of her unconscious mind
4. **Pressure**: Her embrace holding reality together
5. **The [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Hadal Depths|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Hadal Depths]]**: Where her physical form rests

### The Great Awakening (Prophecy)
Multiple conflicting prophecies describe what will happen if the Deep Mother awakens:
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Drowned Prophets|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/The Drowned Prophets]]**: She will remake reality as paradise
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Aboleth Prime Yoth|02 Worldbuilding/People/Aboleth Prime Yoth]]**: All will merge into singular consciousness
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Scattered Emperor|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Scattered Emperor]]**: The world will dissolve back into void
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Prophet Nerida Voidgazer|02 Worldbuilding/People/Prophet Nerida Voidgazer]]**: She already awakens through the shadows

## Physical Manifestations

### The Sleeping Form

- Mountain ranges that are actually her coiled body
- Abyssal trenches that are spaces between her tentacles
- Volcanic vents that are her slow breaths
- Bioluminescent zones marking her dreams
- The [[Depth Pulse]]: Her heartbeat felt throughout Aquabyssos

Her dreams manifest physically as:
- **Shadow Creatures**: Nightmares given form

## Player-Facing Summary

Deep Mother is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Deep Mother as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Deep Mother.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Deep Mother to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at Deep Mother to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to Deep Mother active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
