![[04_Resources/Assets/Art/Lore/Identity_Crisis_Resolution.png|Identity Crisis Resolution Portrait

## Summary
Identity Crisis Resolution describes a turning current in history where choices about memory, depth, and sovereignty reshaped travel, trade, and ritual.

## Historical Context

- Spread: Merchant routes adopted secret signs to bypass tariffs; songs encoded depth-keys.
- Present: Competing narratives justify new taxes, oaths, and contraband routes.

## What It Means at the Table
- Investigation: On a lead toward old tariffs, players can extract schedules that reduce travel risks for a session.
- Social: Reciting the chapel oath grants advantage on one Persuasion check if honored afterward.
- Exploration: Recognizing encoded waystones reduces the chance of getting lost by one step.
