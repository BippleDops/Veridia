## Description
Not among the more pleasant of wizardly duties, dissection is often necessary to acquire rare and unpurchasable spell components. Some (odd) mages also use our dissection instruments to study the inner workings of the bodies of beasts. (I have even known a few scoundrels who have laid open a human corpse in similar fashionâ€”but I quickly set the constabulary on them.) Our dissection kit includes all the knives, pins, sponges, blotters, lenses, and so forth you need to make quick work of this unpleasant task. (10 gp)

## Additional Details
1 is required for a complete laboratory
