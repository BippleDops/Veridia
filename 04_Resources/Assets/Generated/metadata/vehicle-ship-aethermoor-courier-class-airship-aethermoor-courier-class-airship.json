  "revised_prompt": "Immerse in the world of heroic tabletop fantasy, reminiscent of D&D. Picture a medieval-fantasy scenario devoid of modern technology, with a unified painterly collection style. The focus is an Aethermoor Courier-Class Airship, presented as a detailed blueprint cutaway. Visualize from various perspectives - top, side, cross-section, and decks. Include essential components such as ballast, pressure hulls, engines, and crew. Maintain nautical/aeronautical vernacular from the fantasy realm's materials. Strive for romantic realism, as though looking skyward amidst cloudstone and brass structures with wind-swept forms. Colors: navy, gold, cloud-white with warm sun highlights. Use sequential numbered callouts (01, 02, 03...) rather than lengthy text. A neat legend area is desired, without complex paragraphs. Steer clear of random letter strings; opt for meaningful symbols or numeric pins. Avoid elements of sci-fi UIs, photoreal CGI, or anime style, and no bloom glare. Channel a functional, sturdy airship blueprint aesthetic wrapped in fantasy.",
