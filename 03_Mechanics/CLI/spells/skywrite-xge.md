*2nd-level, Transmutation (ritual)*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Sight
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You cause up to ten words to form in a part of the sky you can see. The words appear to be made of cloud and remain in place for the spell's duration. The words dissipate when the spell ends. A strong wind can disperse the clouds and end the spell early.
