## Overview
The Depth Crystal Harvest is a treacherous mining operation located in the deepest trenches surrounding Aquabyssos, where rare pressure-formed crystals grow in the extreme depths. These sites are both essential to the city's economy and extraordinarily dangerous to access.

The crystals harvested here power much of Aquabyssos's magical infrastructure, from pressure regulation systems to communication networks. However, the extreme depth and unstable geology make these operations among the most hazardous in the known world.

## Layout
Multiple mining sites scattered across three major trench systems, connected by reinforced pressure tubes and emergency shelters. Each site consists of extraction platforms, worker habitats, and crystal processing facilities built into the trench walls.

## Mining Operations
**Primary Sites**: Seven active extraction points at depths of 15,000-20,000 feet
**Support Infrastructure**: Pressure-resistant habitats, emergency shelters, transport tubes
**Processing Facilities**: On-site crystal cutting and preliminary refinement
**Safety Systems**: Emergency ascent pods, medical stations, pressure monitoring

## Hazards
**Environmental**: Crushing pressure, unstable geology, equipment failure
**Biological**: Deep predators, pressure-adapted hostile creatures
**Magical**: Crystal energy surges, temporal distortions
**Economic**: Corporate sabotage, worker strikes, supply shortages

## Resources Produced
**Depth Crystals**: Primary magical power source
**Pressure Gems**: Used in advanced equipment manufacturing
**Rare Minerals**: Secondary mining products
**Research Materials**: Specimens for magical research

## Adventure Hooks
