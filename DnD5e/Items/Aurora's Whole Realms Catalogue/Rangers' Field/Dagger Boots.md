## Description
Originally meant for tree climbing, these sharp-toed boots have become popular weapons as well. Constructed of fine grain leather and well-tempered steel, dagger boots provide a sure toehold on even the smoothest bark. Dagger boots have also proven useful in scraps with orcs and other such creatures. Because the claw-shaped blade of these boots is raised from the ground, dagger boots do not impair movement.
