## Description

This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity’s [[2 - Alignment|alignment]]. The [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items (WOTC)/Candle|candle]]’s alignment can be detected with the **[[Detect Evil and Good|detect evil and good]]** spell. The GM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly.

^Alignment

The candle’s magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle’s total burn time.

While lit, the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items (WOTC)/Candle|candle]] sheds [[9 - The Environment|dim light]] in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that [[9 - The Environment|light]] whose [[2 - Alignment|alignment]] matches that of the candle makes [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] rolls, [[6 - Saving Throws|saving throws]], and [[4 - Ability Checks|ability checks]] with [[2 - Advantage and Disadvantage|advantage]]. In addition, a [[Cleric|cleric]] or [[Druid|druid]] in the light whose alignment matches the candle’s can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell’s effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.

Alternatively, when you [[9 - The Environment|light]] the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items (WOTC)/Candle|candle]] for the first |time, you can cast the **[[Gate|gate]]** spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.
