# Haste
Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the [[Attack]] (one weapon attack only), [[Dash]], [[Disengage]], [[Hide]], or [[Use an Object]] action.

When the spell ends, the target can't move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.
