*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 260* Haunting revets possess ruins and forsaken places connected with their deathsâ€”such as abandoned buildings, wrecked ships, or junk heaps. These revets lurk in plain sight, waiting for their foes to near, then trap their victims within their massive bodies. Those inside a revet might be battered by animate furnishings or more unsettling manifestations of the revet's hatred. The places haunting revets lurk swiftly gain infamous reputations. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Revets *Vengeance from beyond the Grave* - **Habitat.** Forest, Swamp, Urban - **Treasure.** Any Wrathful spirits bent on revenge, revets possess corpses and other materials, using them to seek justice or vent their rage on those who wronged them. Revets refuse to rest until those they seek to punish are no more. If their bodies are destroyed, revets claim new forms and continue their ruthless quests.```statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of haunting revet xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around haunting revet xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
