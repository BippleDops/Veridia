# Treasure by Depth

*"The deeper you dare descend, the greater the rewards that await."*

## Overview
Treasure by Depth is a systematic approach to distributing rewards based on the dangerous depths explored in Aquabyssos. This system recognizes that deeper areas require greater risk, preparation, and skill, and should provide proportionally valuable rewards including rare materials, powerful magical items, and unique artifacts unavailable at shallower depths.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
- Depth classification system (Surface to Abyssal)
- Risk assessment protocols
- Rarity scaling for magical items
- Pressure-resistant treasure containers

### Effects
- **Scaled Rewards**: Treasure value increases with depth
- **Unique Materials**: Deeper zones provide rare components
- **Pressure-Forged Items**: Depth-specific magical properties
- **Risk-Reward Balance**: Encourages deep exploration

### Duration
Permanent system governing treasure distribution throughout campaign.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Deep Treasure Map**: Ancient chart shows treasures at extreme depths
2. **Pressure Vault**: Secure treasure storage in deepest zones
3. **Salvage Operation**: Recover valuable cargo from deep wreckage

## Campaign Use
Provides mechanical framework for encouraging exploration while maintaining appropriate challenge-reward ratios.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
