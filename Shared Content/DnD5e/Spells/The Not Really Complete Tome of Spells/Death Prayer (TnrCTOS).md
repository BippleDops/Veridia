# Death Prayer (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *cantrip*

**School**: *Abjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 10 days


## Effects
You pray over a corpse, reducing the like-lihood that it will rise as an undead. If the creature was doomed to rise as undead due to the way it was killed (such as being drained by a vampire), or someone casts a spell such as *animate dead* on the corpse, it will only have a 50% chance of success. This spell provides protection once before dissi-pating.
