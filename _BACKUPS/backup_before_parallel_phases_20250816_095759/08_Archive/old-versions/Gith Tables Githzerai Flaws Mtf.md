| 1 | I see githyanki machinations behind every threat. |
| 2 | I believe in the supremacy of the gith and that githzerai and githyanki will align to rule the multiverse. |
| 3 | I respond to even minor threats with overwhelming displays of force. |
| 4 | The next time I laugh will be the first. The sound of merriment takes me to the edge of violence. |
