## Overview

The Drowning Truth is both a philosophical concept and a physical locationâ€”a massive sphere of crystallized honesty floating in the Philosophical Depths of Aquabyssos. Born from the collective weight of every truth too terrible to speak, it has become a pilgrimage site for those seeking absolute honesty and a prison for those who cannot bear it.

The location manifests as a perfect sphere of transparent water, 300 feet in diameter, where no falsehood can exist. Within its boundaries, all illusions fail, all deceptions crumble, and all beings must confront their absolute reality. Many who enter never leave, unable to face themselves without the comfortable lies that make existence bearable.

### Physical Properties
The Drowning Truth exists simultaneously in three states:

**The Outer Shell (Comfortable Lies)**
- 30-foot thick layer of normal water
- Allows minor self-deceptions
- Visitors feel increasingly uncomfortable
- Temperature drops as truth approaches

**The Middle Layer (Uncomfortable Truths)**
- 50-foot thick layer of heavy water
- Partial truths become visible
- Self-deceptions begin failing
- Physical pressure doubles

**The Core (Absolute Truth)**
- 220-foot diameter sphere of liquid crystal
- No deception possible
- All thoughts become visible
- Reality itself cannot lie

### Metaphysical Properties

**Truth Pressure**
The closer one gets to the center, the greater the "truth pressure":
- **Outer Shell**: White lies become difficult
- **Middle Layer**: Cannot speak falsehoods
- **Core**: Cannot even think untruths

**Reality Enforcement**
- Illusions instantly dispel
- Shapeshifters revert to true forms
- Invisible creatures become visible
- Disguises fall away
- False memories correct themselves

### The First Drowning
Legend says the Drowning Truth formed when the philosopher-queen Veritas spoke a truth so profound that reality couldn't contain it. Her words crystallized into water, and she drowned in her own honesty, becoming the first Guardian of Truth.

### The Heretic's Trial
Three hundred years ago, the accused heretic Malthorn demanded trial by Truth. He entered the sphere and emerged transformedâ€”his lies had been sustaining a beneficial delusion that kept a plague at bay. The resulting epidemic killed thousands.

### The Lovers' Pact
The famous lovers Coral and Pearl entered together, vowing their love was true. Only Pearl emerged. The truth of what happened remains in the sphere, too terrible for her to speak.

**Unveiling (Recharge 5-6).** The Confessor forces all creatures within 60 feet to see themselves as they truly are. Each creature must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute as they confront their true nature.
