# Object of Deception
## Overview
*Magical trap*
Most objects of deception are fashioned to look tempting to intruders. Coins, works of art, treasures, potions, gems, and more could be a trap.

An object of deception is marked with a tiny indentation of an open mouth frozen in a laugh. Any character inspecting the item can find the indentation with a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. A character handling the object feels the indentation with a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check.

A creature who handles the object must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. A creature who fails this saving throw sees allies as hostile enemies and hostile enemies as allies. Kind words sound threatening and threats sound kind coming from these sources. The only way the creature can rid itself of this effect is to stop carrying the object. A creature who succeeds on this saving throw is aware that something or someone tried to affect its mind, but is unsure of the source and is immune to the effect of the object for 24 hours.
