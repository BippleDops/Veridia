# Black Blade of Disaster (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *9th-level*

**School**: *conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
You create a magical, weightless, black blade-shaped planer rift about 3 feet long. The blade strikes at any creature that you can see within its range, using your spell attack modifier and with advantage on the roll.

A creature hit by the *blade* must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 15d10 necrotic damage on a failed sav-ing throw, or half as much on a successful one. The blade can pass through any magical barrier, save an *antimagic fiend*. The blade cannot be harmed by physical attacks, but *dispel magic* and antimagic effects can affect it.
