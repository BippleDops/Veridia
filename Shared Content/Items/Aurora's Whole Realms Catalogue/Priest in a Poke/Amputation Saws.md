## Description
Many warriors fear gangrene more than the sword. When “the rots” sets in, the only recourse at times lay in drastic measures. We stock [[Saws|saws]] for amputating fingers (3 gp), arms (5 gp), legs (10 gp), and trunk sections (13 gp) as well as special joint cutters (7 gp) and snips (5 gp) for removing soft, fleshy parts. Our artisans in Procampur assure us that the keen teeth of their blades are perfectly sized for the limb type to be removed. Note that tourniquets and plenty of absorbent gauze should be on-hand for this procedure. These [[Saws|saws]] are best used upon drunken subjects.
