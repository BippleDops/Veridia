# Fire Storm
*7th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A storm of fire appears within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten 10-foot Cubes, which you arrange as you like. Each [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb|Cube]] must be contiguous with at least one other [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb|Cube]]. Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `7d10` Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried start [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/traps-hazards/burning-xphb|burning]].
