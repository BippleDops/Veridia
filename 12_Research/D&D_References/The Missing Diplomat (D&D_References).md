## Overview
A critical political investigation where Ambassador Nereon Peacekeeper, Aquabyssos's chief diplomat to the surface kingdoms, has disappeared during sensitive treaty negotiations. His vanishing threatens to destabilize fragile peace talks and potentially trigger international conflict.

Time is running out as both sides grow suspicious, and without resolution, years of diplomatic progress could be lost.

## The Situation
**Missing Person**: Ambassador Nereon Peacekeeper, age 45, experienced diplomat
**Last Seen**: Private meeting with surface world trade representatives
**Timeline**: Missing for 72 hours with no communication
**Stakes**: Critical trade agreement worth millions in commerce
**Political Impact**: Both sides beginning to suspect foul play

## Investigation Leads
**Last Known Activities**: Meeting with Trade Minister Goldwater and two surface representatives
**Personal Effects**: Diplomatic case missing, but formal robes left in hotel room
**Witnesses**: Hotel staff report strange visitors asking about the ambassador
**Ficial Records**: Large sum withdrawn from diplomatic account day before disappearance
**Communications**: Encrypted message sent to unknown recipient hours before vanishing

## Key NPCs
**Trade Minister Sarah Goldwater**: Last person to see ambassador officially
**Surface Representative Captain Marcus**: Claims meeting ended normally
**Hotel Concierge Philip**: Noticed suspicious individuals near ambassador's room
**Security Chief Marina**: Leading official investigation with limited resources
**Underground Contact "Whisper"**: May have information about unofficial activities

## Possible Theories
**Kidnapping**: Enemy agents captured him to sabotage negotiations
**Assassination**: Killed by extremists opposed to surface world relations
**Defection**: Voluntarily disappeared with classified information or funds
**Protection**: Hiding after discovering assassination plot against him
**Personal Crisis**: Family emergency forced immediate departure

## Time Pressure
**72 Hours**: Surface delegation threatens to leave without resolution
**1 Week**: Trade agreement expires without ambassador's signature
**2 Weeks**: Political opposition may call for investigation of entire diplomatic corps
**1 Month**: International reputation damage becomes permanent

## The Truth (DM Options)
**Option A**: Ambassador discovered assassination plot and went into hiding
**Option B**: Kidnapped by extremist faction trying to prevent peace
**Option C**: Voluntarily disappeared after discovering corruption in negotiations
**Option D**: Surface world double agent trying to steal diplomatic secrets
**Option E**: Personal blackmail forcing him to cooperate with criminal elements

## Resolution Paths
**Rescue Mission**: Locate and extract ambassador from captors
**Diplomatic Solution**: Negotiate release through proper channels
**Investigation**: Expose conspiracy and clear ambassador's name
**Cover-up**: Manage political fallout while continuing private search
**Replacement**: Find qualified substitute to continue negotiations

## Rewards and Consequences
**Success**: Prevent diplomatic crisis, maintain peace process, gain political favor
**Partial Success**: Find ambassador but damage already done to negotiations
**Failure**: International incident, trade war, or actual military conflict
**Experience**: 3,000-5,000 XP depending on resolution method and speed

## Adventure Hooks
1. Characters hired by government to supplement official investigation
2. Surface world contacts request discrete assistance
3. Family member asks for help finding missing relative
4. Intelligence suggests characters might be next targets

## Long-term Impact
Success maintains peaceful relations and opens future diplomatic opportunities. Failure could lead to trade wars, border conflicts, or breakdown of international cooperation.

## DM Notes
This investigation combines political intrigue with detective work. Focus on the ticking clock of diplomatic deadlines and the complex motivations of various factions. The truth should be logical but not obvious, requiring players to piece together multiple clues.
