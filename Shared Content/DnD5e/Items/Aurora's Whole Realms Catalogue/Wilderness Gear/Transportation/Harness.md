## Description
Leave behind the plowman’s trappings—our light and sturdy harness can add miles to a horse’s endurance and speed to its gait. Suitable for heavily loaded wagons and fine carriages alike, this harness has a stuffed-bottom pad, blacked Ordulan leather traces and lines, heavily folded breeching, comfortable breast [[Straps|straps]], and a blinded bridle. Available in single (3 gp) and double (5 gp) horse draws. We also supply four (9 gp), six (15 gp), and eight horse draws (22 gp), though they must be special ordered. Meant for horses 1,250 lb or less. Larger harness for horses up to 1,600 lb cost half again more.
