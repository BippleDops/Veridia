# Goldspire Port

*The Confederacy's Eye on Aethermoor*

## Overview
Goldspire Port stands as the closest major Confederacy city to Aethermoor, a gleaming trade hub where merchants, spies, and refugees mingle. Built into towering golden cliffs, the city watches Aethermoor's crisis with calculating interest, serving as both potential salvation and threat.

## Description
The city rises in seven terraced levels carved into coastal cliffs of golden sandstone. Each level represents a different economic class, with mechanical lifts powered by steam and clockwork (deliberately avoiding crystal technology) connecting them. The harbor below bristles with ships from across the known world, while the summit holds the Confederate Trade Council's fortress-palace.

### The Seven Tiers
1. **Tide Ward** - Docks, warehouses, and sailor quarters
2. **Merchant Quarter** - Shops, markets, and trading houses
3. **Craft District** - Workshops and guild halls (crystal-tech research labs)
4. **Embassy Row** - Foreign delegations and refugee quarters
5. **Gold Gardens** - Wealthy merchant estates
6. **Confederate Heights** - Government buildings and military
7. **The Spire** - Trade Council's palace and intelligence headquarters

## Key Locations Within

### The Refugee Quarter
A growing district in Embassy Row where Aethermoor expatriates gather, bringing crystal corruption fears with them. Heavily monitored by Confederate agents.

### The Null Vault
Secret facility where confiscated crystal artifacts are studied and neutralized. Run by the Department of Existential Threats.

### The Market of Whispers
Information brokerage where intelligence about Aethermoor is bought and sold. [[Zephyr Goldwhisper]] maintains an office here.

## Important Figures
- **Trade Prince Aurelius Gilt** - Rules the city, sees Aethermoor as an investment opportunity
- **Admiral Brass Hookhand** - Prepares invasion fleet "just in case"
- **Dr. Eliza Copperlock** - Studies crystal samples, developing countermeasures
- **The Refugee Council** - Aethermoor expats planning their homeland's salvation

## Connections to Aethermoor
- **[[Port Meridian]]**: Regular trade routes, though increasingly restricted
- **[[Zephyr Goldwhisper]]**: Main intelligence asset in Aethermoor
- **[[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]**: Confederacy has offered her asylum (with conditions)
- **[[The Crimson Sage]]**: Confederate spies seek his true identity
- **[[Crystalhaven]]**: Official diplomatic relations, unofficial subversion

## Current Activities
- Building a fleet of "humanitarian aid" ships (invasion ready)
- Developing crystal-nullification technology
- Creating economic dependencies in Aethermoor
- Recruiting Aethermoor refugees as future puppet government

## DM Secrets
> [!warning] The Confederate Solution
> The Trade Council has approved "Operation Goldfall" - if Aethermoor's corruption spreads beyond its borders, they'll implement total quarantine and bombardment. The city has massive crystal-nullifying weapons ready to deploy.

> [!danger] The Economic War
> Goldspire is deliberately manipulating Aethermoor's economy to force annexation. They're buying up debts, creating supply shortages, and preparing to offer "aid" that comes with sovereignty-surrendering conditions.

> [!info] The Refugee Underground
> Not all refugees support the Confederacy's plans. A resistance movement called "Free Aethermoor" operates from the Refugee Quarter, smuggling supplies and information back home.

## Notable Features

### The Crystal Museum
Displays "safely contained" artifacts from Aethermoor, propaganda tool showing Confederate superiority over crystal corruption.

### The Neutrality Towers
Massive devices that create a field preventing crystal energy within the city. Side effect: any corrupted individual entering experiences excruciating pain.

### The Gold Fleet
- 30 warships ready for "humanitarian intervention"
- 50 merchant vessels creating economic stranglehold
- 12 scout ships monitoring Aethermoor's coasts

## Resources Available
- Crystal-nullification devices (extremely expensive)
- Safe haven for uncorrupted refugees
- Loans and economic aid (with harsh terms)
- Military "advisors" and "peacekeepers"
- Intelligence about other foreign powers

## Plot Hooks
- Negotiate aid without surrendering sovereignty
- Expose or support Operation Goldfall
- Steal crystal-nullification technology
- Rally refugee support for Aethermoor
- Prevent or assist economic takeover
- Uncover Confederate spies in Aethermoor

## Travel Options
- **By Sea**: 2 weeks from [[Port Meridian]] (if permitted)
- **By Crystal Gate**: Impossible (null field prevents it)
- **By Air**: Confederate airships (restricted to diplomats)
