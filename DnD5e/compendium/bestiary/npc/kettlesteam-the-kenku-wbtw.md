## Description

Kettlesteam the kenku snoops around the carnival under the cover of a [disguise self](/compendium/spells/disguise-self.md) spell, looking to cause trouble. The kenku has stolen the voice of a human mime named Candlefoot (see "Hall of Illusions "earlier in the chapter). While this prize remains in her possession, Kettlesteam can speak clearly in Candlefoot's soft, silky voice.
