## Description
Though much of magic draws its power from the world of matter, many mages turn their eyes also to the quintessent heavens. For those who have only a passing interest in the stars, we offer a solid bronze astrolabe (8 gp) crafted in Sembia and useful for tracking the sun, planets, and stars across the heavens. Our full armillary (60 gp) provides a near-flawless model of the principal celestial circles.

## Additional Details
1 astrolabe is required for a complete laboratory
