# New Tethys - The Glass City

## Overview
Built within and around the drowned spires of the ancient surface capital, New Tethys stands as the largest and most politically important city in [[Aquabyssos World Overview]]. Enormous glass domes connected by covered tunnels preserve pockets of air, while the flooded districts between them teem with adapted inhabitants. The city exists in the Twilight Reaches, where dying sunlight still filters through the waters, creating an eternal golden-green dusk.

## Districts

### The Crown Dome
The largest air-filled dome, housing the [[Archon Meredith Saltweaver]] palace and the [[Tethyan Hegemony]] government buildings. The original throne room sits preserved here, though flooded and converted to a monument.

### The Merchant Depths
Flooded commercial district where [[Captain Garrett Stormcutter]] maintains his trading post. Connected to [[The Phosphor Markets]] via guarded trade currents. Most shops are adapted for both air-breathing and water-breathing customers.

### Scholar's Spiral
A partially flooded tower complex housing the local branch of the [[Abyssal Academy]]. [[Sage Lysander Deepthought]] maintains his laboratory in the deepest accessible level.

### The Reef Gardens
Living coral shaped into residential structures, primarily housing the adapted population. [[Duke Cyrus Reefheart]] maintains a manor here as the [[Coral Courts]] embassy.

### The Pressure Slums
Deepest inhabited section where [[The Free Current]] operates in shadows. Those who can't afford pressure protection magic cluster here, often showing signs of depth-related mutations.

## Notable Locations

### The Conservatory of Memory
A museum preserving artifacts and memories from before [[The Great Drowning]]. Managed by [[Keeper Elara Mindwell]], who guards dangerous pre-flood knowledge.

### The Tide Gates
Massive magical barriers controlling water flow between districts. Controlled by [[Gatekeeper Iron-Lung Boris]], a former surface dweller who refused adaptation.

### The Floating Market
A weekly market that occurs when merchants gather their buoyant stalls. [[Merchant Delilah Currentrunner]] coordinates vendors and manages disputes.

### Temple of Dual Breath
The main temple of the [[Church of the Tidal Throne]], where [[Prophet Nerida Voidgazer]] delivers sermons about divine judgment and redemption through drowning.

### The Pressure Academy
Training ground for the [[Depth Wardens]], where [[Admiral Thorne Blackwater]] recruits and trains elite underwater soldiers.

## Services & Shops

### The Gill & Gill Tavern
Run by [[Tavern Keeper Finn Splitlung]], serves both air and water in separated sections. Known for information trading and neutral ground meetings.

### Deepcraft Armory
[[Forge Master Petra Hammerdeep]] creates pearlsteel weapons and armor resistant to pressure and corrosion. Secretly supplies [[The Free Current]].

### Current's End Inn
Managed by [[Innkeeper Marina Dreamwhisper]], offers rooms for all adaptation levels. Rumors say she's connected to [[The Deepmind Conspiracy]].

### The Bubble Boutique
[[Seamstress Coral Silkweaver]] creates magical clothing that functions both in air and water. Hides encoded messages in her designs.

## Government & Law
- Ruled by the [[Tethyan Hegemony]] through Archon Meredith Saltweaver
- Laws favor trade and taxation over personal freedom
- [[Enforcer Chief Mako Ironjaw]] leads the city watch
