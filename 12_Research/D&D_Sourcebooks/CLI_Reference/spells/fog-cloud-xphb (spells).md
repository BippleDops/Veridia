# Fog Cloud
*1st-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create a 20-foot-radius [[Area of Effect Xphb]] of fog centered on a point within range. The [[Area of Effect Xphb]] is [[Heavily Obscured Xphb]]. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (such as one created by [[Gust of Wind Xphb]]) disperses it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The fog's radius increases by 20 feet for each spell slot level above 1.
