--- # Flame Blade

*2nd-level, Evocation* - **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sumac leaf)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke it again as a [[Action Xphb. As a [actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you can make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes Fire damage equal to``dice: 3d6``plus your spellcasting ability modifier. The flaming blade sheds [[Light Xphb in a 10-foot radius and [Light Xphb]] for an additional 10 feet. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by`d6`for each spell slot level above 2. **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 275.
