--- # Call Lightning

*3rd-level, Conjuration* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes A storm cloud appears at a point within range that you can see above yourself. It takes the shape of a [[Area of Effect Xphb]] that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot radius. When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see under the cloud. A lightning bolt shoots from the cloud to that point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking`3d10`Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Until the spell ends, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to call down lightning in that way again, targeting the same point or a different one. If you're outdoors in a storm when you cast this spell, the spell gives you control over that storm instead of creating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell's damage increases by`d10`. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by`d10`for each spell slot level above 3. **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 248.
