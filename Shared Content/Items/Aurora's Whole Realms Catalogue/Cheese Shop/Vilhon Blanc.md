## Description
A crumbly, square burgundy cheese made with the heavy red wine found in the region. The wine itself travels poorly, but when mixed into the cheese provides a sweet concoction that is popular as far north as Neverwinter. Made in great platters, the [[Turmish Brick|Turmish brick]] is ripened and carved, and each loaf is wrapped in red wax, giving the cheese its common appearance. Available in 1 lb rectangular loaves (4 sp) and 100 gp cubic wheys (35 gp)
