# Loadstone

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** rare

**Weight**: 1 lbs.

## Description

This stone is a large gem worth 150 gp.

**Curse** The stone is cursed, but its magical nature is hidden; [[Detect Magic (Ritual)|Detect Magic]] doesn't detect it. An [[Identify (Ritual)|Identify]]  spell reveals the stone's true nature. If you use the [[Dash]]  or [[Disengage]] action while the stone is on your person, its curse activates. Until the curse is broken with [[remove curse]]  or similar magic, your speed is reduced by 5 feet, and your maximum load and maximum lift capacities are halved. You also become unwilling to part with the stone.
