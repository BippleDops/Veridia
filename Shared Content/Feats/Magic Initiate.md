# Magic Initiate

## Overview

Choose a class: [[Spells#^BardSpells|bard]], [[Spells#^ClericSpells|cleric]], [[Spells#^DruidSpells|druid]], [[Spells#^SorcererSpells|sorcerer]], [[Spells#^WarlockSpells|warlock]], or [[Spells#^WizardSpells|wizard]]. You learn two cantrips of your choice from that class's spell list.

## Effects

- In addition, choose one 1st-level spell from that same list. You learn that spell and can cast it at its lowest level. Once you cast it, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it again using this feat.
- Your spellcasting ability for these spells depends on the class you chose: Charisma for bard, sorcerer, or warlock; Wisdom for cleric or druid; or Intelligence for wizard.
