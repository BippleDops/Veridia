## Overview
The Liminal Trading Company has built a vast commercial empire based on the simple principle that different worlds have different resources, and where there are differences, there is profit. Operating from [[pat—a dimensional nexus that exists partially in both [Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos—they facilitate trade between the realms while maintaining careful political neutrality. Their success comes from being indispensable to both worlds while belonging fully to neither.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **The Trade War**: Mediate dispute between Company and local merchants
2. **The Smuggling Ring**: Investigate illegal goods moving through Company channels
3. **The Diplomatic Incident**: Help resolve cross-realm political crisis affecting trade
4. **The Floating Market Heist**: Protect or plan robbery of dimensional trading post
5. **The Portal Pirates**: Stop raiders attacking Company transport routes

### Company Hierarchy
1. **Portal Apprentice**: New employees learning basic dimensional travel
2. **Trade Courier**: Qualified to transport simple goods between realms
3. **Cultural Liaison**: Specialist in one realm's customs and markets
4. **Dimensional Navigator**: Licensed to pilot through unstable portal routes
5. **Market Specialist**: Expert in specific commodity types or regions
6. **Trade Captain**: Authorized to negotiate major deals independently
7. **Regional Director**: Manages Company operations in specific areas
8. **Executive Council Member**: Leadership positions with Company-wide authority

### The Profit Paradigm
The Company operates under the fundamental principle that economic prosperity creates peace and stability. Their corporate culture emphasizes:
- **Cross-Cultural Competency**: All employees must understand both realm cultures
- **Neutral Professionalism**: Personal politics never interfere with business
- **Innovation Incentives**: Bonuses for discovering new trade opportunities
- **Risk Management**: Comprehensive insurance and safety protocols
- **Long-term Thinking**: Decisions evaluated for multi-decade impact

### The Profit Above All Doctrine
Despite public claims of ethical business practices, internal memos reveal the Company sometimes trades in morally questionable goods and services when profits are substantial enough.

### Portal Monopoly Manipulation
The Company has secret agreements with government officials to limit competitor access to dimensional travel, maintaining their effective monopoly through regulatory capture.

### The Quantum Accountant's Identity
This mysterious figure is actually an artificial intelligence created from the merged consciousness of seven brilliant economists, explaining their supernatural ability to predict market trends.

### Realm Destabilization Profits
Some executives have discovered they can profit from creating minor conflicts and trade disruptions, then offering expensive solutions to problems they secretly caused.

### The Convergence Investment
The Company has secretly invested heavily in [The Convergence Seekers]], believing merged worlds would create unprecedented business opportunities despite massive initial disruption.

### Long-Term Vision (25+ Years)
The Company ultimately envisions itself as the foundation of a unified multi-dimensional economy, with their neutral status and cross-realm expertise making them indispensable to any future political arrangements between worlds.
