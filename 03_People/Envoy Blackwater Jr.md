## Overview
Envoy Cassius Blackwater Jr. represents the third generation of the infamous Blackwater diplomatic dynasty. Born into privilege but marked by shadow from birth, Cassius walks the knife's edge between legitimate diplomacy and occult conspiracy. He serves as Aquabyssos's primary envoy to the Shadow Parliament while maintaining the facade of a respectable diplomatic heir. His charm and political acumen mask a deep corruption that threatens to consume both him and the realm he serves.

## Physical Description
Standing 6'1" with the lean, elegant build typical of diplomatic nobility, Cassius possesses an otherworldly handsomeness that draws attention in any room. His half-elven heritage is evident in his sharp features and pointed ears, but shadow corruption has left its mark—his naturally dark hair contains streaks that seem to absorb light, and his green eyes occasionally flash with an inner darkness.

He dresses immaculately in the latest diplomatic fashions, favoring deep blues and silver that complement Aquabyssos's formal protocols. His clothing always includes subtle shadow-touched elements: cufflinks that seem to drink light, a cloak pin that whispers in dead languages, and rings that grow cold when lies are spoken nearby.

A thin scar runs from his left temple to his jaw—a memento from his first diplomatic mission where he nearly died before making his pact with shadow entities. He covers it with carefully applied cosmetics during formal occasions.

## Background
Born into the prestigious Blackwater family, Cassius was groomed from childhood to continue the family's diplomatic tradition. The Blackwaters have served as Aquabyssos's premier diplomats for three generations, with each generation pushing the boundaries of acceptable political maneuvering further into morally gray territory.

Cassius's father, Admiral Thorne Blackwater, was a war hero who transitioned into diplomacy. His grandfather established the family's reputation through successful trade negotiations. Cassius, however, has taken the family legacy into truly dark territory.

During his first major diplomatic mission at age 22—negotiating with hostile deep-sea entities—Cassius found himself overwhelmed and facing certain death. In desperation, he made contact with shadow entities from beyond the normal realm, trading portions of his soul for the power to not just survive, but to excel beyond all expectations. This pact granted him supernatural diplomatic abilities but slowly corrupted his essential nature.

## Special Abilities

**Diplomatic Immunity.** Cassius has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, or magically compelled by creatures of equal or lower social standing. He also has resistance to psychic damage from political or social sources.

**Shadow Patron's Gift.** Once per long rest, Cassius can reroll any Charisma-based check and must use the new result. Additionally, he can cast *charm person* at will and *suggestion* three times per day without expending spell slots.

**Blackwater Legacy.** Cassius has advantage on History checks related to diplomatic precedents and political maneuvering. He automatically knows the general political stance of any government official he meets.

**Whispers of the Deep.** Cassius can understand and speak with any sentient creature for diplomatic purposes, as if under a permanent *tongues* effect. However, shadow entities sometimes whisper through his words without his conscious control.

**Warlock Spellcasting.** Cassius is a 10th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save **DC 17**, +9 to hit). He regains all expended spell slots when he finishes a short or long rest. He knows the following warlock spells:

- **Cantrips (at will)**: *eldritch blast*, *minor illusion*, *prestidigitation*, *mage hand*
- **1st-5th level (2 5th-level slots)**: *armor of Agathys*, *hex*, *hold person*, *counterspell*, *dimension door*, *dominate person*, *scrying*, *modify memory*

## Actions

**Multiattack.** Cassius makes two Eldritch Blast attacks or casts a spell and makes one weapon attack.

**Diplomatic Blade.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`dice: `dice: 1d8`` + 3) piercing damage plus 9 (`dice: `dice: 2d8``) necrotic damage. If the target is charmed by Cassius, they take an additional 7 (`dice: `dice: 2d6``) psychic damage.

**Eldritch Blast.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +9 to hit, range 120 ft., up to two targets. *Hit:* 12 (`dice: `dice: 1d10`` + 5) force damage. Targets are pushed 10 feet away from Cassius.

**Shadow Diplomacy (3/Day).** Cassius speaks with supernatural persuasion. All creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a **DC 17** Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 1 hour. Charmed creatures view Cassius's requests as reasonable and are inclined to agree to diplomatic proposals.

**Invoke Shadow Patron (1/Day).** Cassius calls upon his shadow patron for aid. For the next minute, he gains the following benefits:
- Resistance to all damage types
- His spells ignore resistance to necrotic and psychic damage
- Creatures that start their turn within 10 feet of him must succeed on a **DC 17** Wisdom save or be frightened until the start of their next turn

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Voice**: Warm and friendly

**Speech Pattern**: Casual and relaxed

**Physical Habits**: Remains perfectly still

### Hidden Truths (DM Only)
> [!warning] DM Secrets
> - **The Soul Debt**: Cassius has traded 60% of his soul to shadow entities. When the debt reaches 80%, he'll become their permanent puppet
> - **Father's Fate**: Admiral Thorne Blackwater is alive but completely shadow-corrupted, serving as a shadow general in hidden wars
> - **The True Mission**: The Shadow Parliament is using Cassius to identify and corrupt key Aquabyssos officials for a planned takeover
> - **Sister's Protection**: Everything he does is ultimately to protect his sister from the same fate that claimed him
> - **The Grandfather's Secret**: His grandfather's diplomatic successes were also aided by shadow pacts, making corruption a family tradition
> - **The Final Diplomacy**: He's planning to offer his remaining soul to save his sister, but this would trigger a diplomatic crisis between realms

### Primary Motivations
1. **Family Honor**: Preserve and enhance the Blackwater diplomatic legacy
2. **Personal Power**: Gain enough influence to break free from his shadow debts
3. **Sister's Safety**: Protect Lady Nerissa from the consequences of his choices
4. **Realm Security**: Genuinely believes his shadow alliance will protect Aquabyssos from greater threats

## Combat Tactics
Cassius avoids physical confrontation whenever possible, preferring to use diplomacy, manipulation, and supernatural abilities to resolve conflicts. When forced to fight:

- **Opening Move**: Casts *armor of Agathys* and *hex* on the most dangerous opponent
- **Control Strategy**: Uses *hold person* and *dominate person* to turn enemies into allies
- **Psychological Warfare**: Invokes his Shadow Patron to frighten enemies while negotiating
- **Defensive Options**: Uses *counterspell* to protect allies and *dimension door* to reposition
- **Last Resort**: Attempts to negotiate even while fighting, offering information or services for mercy

## Adventure Hooks

1. **The Shadow Summit** - Cassius is organizing a secret diplomatic meeting between Aquabyssos nobles and Shadow Parliament representatives. The party must infiltrate or stop this gathering that could change the political landscape forever.

2. **The Father's Return** - Admiral Thorne Blackwater has been spotted in shadow-corrupted form near Aquabyssos borders. Cassius desperately needs the party's help to either save his father or put him to rest with honor.

3. **The Soul Auction** - Cassius's shadow debts are being called in, and various entities are bidding for pieces of his soul. He needs the party to help him navigate this supernatural legal battle or find alternative payment.

4. **The Sister's Salvation** - Lady Nerissa Blackwater has discovered her brother's corruption and threatens to expose him. Cassius asks the party to protect her while he finds a way to break his shadow pacts without destroying his family.

5. **The Diplomatic Crisis** - A major treaty negotiation is being sabotaged by shadow entities working through Cassius. The party must uncover the supernatural interference without destroying legitimate diplomatic relations.

6. **The Inheritance Investigation** - The Blackwater family estate contains generations of diplomatic secrets, including evidence of ancestral shadow pacts. Various factions want access to this information, putting Cassius and the party in the middle of a treasure hunt with political implications.

7. **The Double Agent** - Cassius reveals he's been working against the Shadow Parliament from within, but his deep corruption makes his true loyalties unclear. The party must decide whether to trust him in a plan to expose shadow infiltration of the government.

8. **The Final Negotiation** - Cassius's soul debt reaches critical levels, and he's planning a desperate diplomatic gambit to break free. This involves negotiating with cosmic entities and risking not just his life but the stability of reality itself.

### Personality in Action
**Voice**: Cultured and sophisticated, with perfect diction and diplomatic phrasing. Occasionally, shadow whispers slip into his speech, causing brief lapses in his composed demeanor.

**Mannerisms**:
- Unconsciously traces his scar when thinking deeply or stressed
- Always maintains perfect posture and formal bearing
- His shadow sometimes moves independently when he's agitated
- Touches his family signet ring when invoking family honor

## The Blackwater Legacy

The Blackwater family's diplomatic tradition spans three generations, with each building upon the last:

**Grandfather's Era**: Established family reputation through legitimate diplomatic skill and trade negotiations. Made the first shadow pact near the end of his life to secure a crucial treaty.

**Father's Era**: Expanded influence through military diplomacy and post-war negotiations. Deepened shadow connections to broker peace with hostile entities. Eventually consumed by shadow corruption.

**Cassius's Era**: Represents the culmination and possible destruction of the family legacy. His shadow debts are the deepest yet, but so is his diplomatic influence. Whether he saves or damns the family name depends on his choices in the coming crisis.

## The Shadow Debt System

Cassius's supernatural abilities come at the cost of his soul, measured as percentages:

- **20% Debt**: Gained supernatural charm and diplomatic immunity
- **40% Debt**: Acquired warlock spellcasting and shadow whispers
- **60% Debt (Current)**: Enhanced all abilities but shadow entities can sometimes override his decisions
- **80% Debt (Danger Zone)**: Would become permanent puppet of shadow entities
- **100% Debt**: Complete soul consumption and transformation into shadow entity

## Plot Threads
Envoy Blackwater Jr. serves as a perfect example of corruption disguised as patriotism and can be involved in numerous plot threads:
- Supernatural corruption in government
- Family legacy and inherited obligations
- The price of power and diplomatic success
- Loyalty versus survival in supernatural politics
- The thin line between necessary compromise and soul-damning corruption

His character represents the theme that sometimes the greatest threats to a realm come from those who genuinely believe they're protecting it, and that the road to damnation is paved with diplomatic intentions.
