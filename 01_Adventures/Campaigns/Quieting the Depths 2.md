# Quieting the Depths

*"Some sounds should never echo in the deep."*

## Overview
A supernatural crisis quest where an ancient evil stirs in the deepest ocean trenches, sending disturbing sounds and psychic disturbances throughout Aquabyssos. Citizens report hearing whispers in their dreams, and some have begun sleepwalking toward the depths.

Ancient texts suggest this awakening occurs every few centuries and requires specific rituals to quiet the entity before it fully emerges.

## The Ancient Threat
**Entity Name**: The Voice Beneath (true name unknown)
**Nature**: Primordial being predating current civilization
**Power**: Psychic influence, dream manipulation, sonic attacks
**Goal**: Escape from deep ocean prison and reclaim the world
**Weaknesses**: Vulnerable to specific ancient binding rituals

## Current Manifestations

- Marine life fleeing the area in massive migrations
- Magical disturbances affecting spellcasters

## Symptoms in Population
**Mild Exposure**: Restless sleep, anxiety, hearing whispers
**Moderate Exposure**: Sleepwalking, obsessive thoughts about depths
**Severe Exposure**: Complete mental domination, dangerous behavior

## The Quieting Ritual
**Requirements**: Five ancient artifacts scattered throughout region
**Participants**: Must be performed by group of at least three people
**Location**: Ritual chamber in deepest accessible part of ocean
**Timing**: Must be completed before entity reaches full awakening
**Consequences**: Success binds entity for centuries, failure releases it permanently

## Ancient Artifacts Needed
**The Silence Stone**: Absorbs sound and psychic energy
**Binding Chains of Depth**: Forged from deepest ocean metals
**The Warding Crystal**: Protects minds from entity's influence
**Sacred Waters**: From the first spring touched by sunlight

## Artifact Locations
**Silence Stone**: Guarded by echoing spirits in abandoned temple
**Binding Chains**: Hidden in royal treasury, heavily protected
**Warding Crystal**: Lost in merchant's collection, requires negotiation
**Sacred Waters**: Source located in dangerous surface world territory
**Sealing Scroll**: Possessed by hermit scholar in remote location

## Quest Structure
**Phase 1**: Research the threat and learn about required ritual
**Phase 2**: Locate and gather the five necessary artifacts
**Phase 3**: Journey to ritual site in deepest ocean trench
**Phase 4**: Perform binding ritual while entity actively opposes
**Phase 5**: Ensure ritual completion and escape safely

## Opposition Forces

**Captain Rex Ironlung**: Military officer organizing city defense
**Dr. Echo Soundweaver**: Researcher studying psychic phenomena
**The Depth Walker**: Mysterious figure who knows artifact locations

## Environmental Challenges

- Unpredictable current patterns disturbed by entity's awakening
- Hostile marine life driven mad by psychic influence
- Equipment failure in areas of high supernatural activity

2. Government recruits team for emergency supernatural response
3. Ancient prophecy identifies party as potential ritual performers
4. Character's family member severely affected by psychic influence
