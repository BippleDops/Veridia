# Negative Energy Flood
You send ribbons of negative energy at one creature you can see within range. Unless the target is undead, it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking `dice: 5d12|avg` (5d12) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A target killed by this damage rises up as a [[zombie]] at the start of your next turn. The zombie pursues whatever creature it can see that is closest to it. Statistics for the [[zombie]] are in the Monster Manual.

If you target an undead with this spell, the target doesn't make a saving throw. Instead, roll 5d12. The target gains half the total as temporary hit points.
