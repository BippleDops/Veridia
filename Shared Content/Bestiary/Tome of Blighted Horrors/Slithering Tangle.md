# Slithering Tangle
## Overview
### Slithering Tangle
![[zryjlrwl.nyi.png|Slithering Tangle|300]]
[[zryjlrwl.nyi.png|open outside]]

*A sinister serpentine tangle of rotting vines ends in an approximation of a humanoid head, its maw lined with slime-dripping thorns.*

**Initiative**: +0

**Armor Class**: 16 (natural armor)

**Challenge**: CR 8

**Experience**: 3,900 XP

## Other Details
**Ability Scores**: Str 19 (+4), Dex 11 (+0), Con 18 (+4), Int 11 (+0), Wis 13 (+1), Cha 18 (+4)

## Special Traits
**Constrict:** A grappled creature takes `dice: 1d8 + 4` bludgeoning damage at the start of the slithering tangle’s turn.

**Electric Fortitude:** When a slithering tangle is hit by an attack that causes lightning damage, it gains temporary hit points equal to half the lightning damage.

**Spellcasting:** The slithering tangle is an arcane spellcaster that uses Charisma as its spellcasting ability (DC 15, attack +7). It doesn’t need material or vocal components to cast spells.

*Cantrips (at will):* dancing lights, light, mage hand, minor illusion, shocking grasp

*1st level (x4):* color spray, ray of sickness, shield, silent image, thunderwave

*2nd level (x4):* hold person, misty step, scorching ray, suggestion

*3rd level (x2):* lightning bolt, stinking cloud

## Actions
**Multiattack:** Because the slithering tangle needs only somatic components to cast spells and it has hundreds of shoots, it can bite and cast a spell on the same turn.

**Melee Attack—Bite:** +7 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d6 + 4` piercing damage plus `dice: 2d8` poison damage, and the creature must make a successful DC 15 Str saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 14). A slithering tangle can have up to two Medium or smaller creatures grappled at one time. Maintaining grapples doesn’t interfere with the slithering tangle’s ability to bite or cast spells.

**Area Attack—Fascinating Cloud (1/day):** The slithering tangle emits a transparent cloud of pollen as a bonus action. Breathing creatures within 20 feet of the slithering tangle must make a successful DC 15 Cha saving throw or be charmed for as long as the creature remains in the cloud, which lasts 5 rounds unless dispersed sooner by wind. A charmed creature that’s not in the cloud repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself with a success.

## Description
**Environment**: Swamp, underground (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary or nest (2–4)

Slithering tangles appear to be snakelike tangles of rotting vegetation, but like shambling mounds, they are actually intelligent, carnivorous plants akin to animate tangles of creeping parasitic vines. They are morbid, hateful creatures shunned for their loathesome sorcerous powers.

These repulsive creatures lair in despoiled forests and fetid swamps where they blend in with the surrounding terrain while they wait to ambush their prey. They also can be found underground living among damp fungal thickets.

They are able to draw sustenance by parasitizing other plants and by sending rootlets into the soil to absorb raw nutrients, but they prefer to consume flesh and bone from animals crushed in their coils.
