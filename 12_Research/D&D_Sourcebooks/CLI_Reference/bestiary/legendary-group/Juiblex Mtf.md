# Juiblex

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_

On Initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Juiblex can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; he can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Juiblex slimes a square area of ground it can see within the lair. The area can be up to 10 feet on a side. The slime lasts for 1 hour or until it is burned away with fire. When the slime appears, each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or become [[conditions#Restrained|restrained]]. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, that creature must make the same save. A [[conditions#Restrained|restrained]] creature is stuck as long as it remains in the slimy area or until it breaks free. The [[conditions#Restrained|restrained]] creature, or another creature who can reach it, can use its action to try to break free and must succeed on a DC 21 Strength check. If the slime is set on fire, it burns away after 1 round. Any creature that starts its turn in the burning slime takes 22 (`4d10`) fire damage.  
- Juiblex slimes a square area of ground it can see within the lair. The area can be up to 10 feet on a side. The slime lasts for 1 hour or until it is burned away with fire. When the slime appears, each creature on it must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or fall [[conditions#Prone|prone]] and slide 10 feet in a random direction determined by a `d8` roll. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, that creature must make the same save. If the slime is set on fire, it burns away after 1 round. Any creature that starts its turn in the burning slime takes 22 (`4d10`) fire damage.  
- A [[green-slime-xdmg|green slime]] (see the "Dungeon Master's Guide") appears on a spot on the ceiling that Juiblex chooses within the lair. The slime disintegrates after 1 hour.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_

The region containing Juiblex's lair is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

- Small bodies of water, such as ponds or wells, within 1 mile of the lair turn highly acidic, corroding any object that touches them. Surfaces within 6 miles of the lair are frequently covered by a thin film of slime, which is slick and sticks to anything that touches it.  
- If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or descend into a madness determined by the Madness of Juiblex table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.  

If Juiblex dies, these effects fade over the course of `d10` days.

### Madness of Juiblex

If a creature goes mad in Juiblex's lair or within line of sight of the demon lord, roll on the Madness of Juiblex table to determine the nature of the madness, which is a character flaw that lasts until cured. See the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for more on madness.
