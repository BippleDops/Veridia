# Everfull Quiver (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You enchant a quiver that contains at least two arrows. Each round for the next minute, you withdraw up to two arrows without depleting the total number of arrows in the quiver.

If more than two arrows are withdrawn in a single round, or if anyone other than you draws an arrow, the spell ends. You must use an arrow the same round you draw it; otherwise, it fades into nothingness.

This spell can only create nonmagical ar-rows.
