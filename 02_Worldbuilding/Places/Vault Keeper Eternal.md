## Background & Motivations

[[Vault Keeper Eternal]] stands as the eternal guardian of the [[Ancient Treasury of Tides]], a massive underwater vault complex in the depths of [[Aquabyssos]]. Created over three centuries ago by the [[Artificers' Consortium]], he was originally known simply as "Keeper-7" until he earned his current moniker through centuries of unwavering service.

### The Creation
Eternal was forged during the height of the [[Age of Wonders]], when the greatest minds of [[Aquabyssos]] united to create secure repositories for their most precious artifacts and knowledge. The [[Master Artificer Thymallos]] personally oversaw his construction, imbuing him with not just mechanical precision but a sense of duty that transcends his constructed nature. His [[Warforged]] body was crafted from rare [[Deepsteel]] and powered by a [[Heart of Eternal Vigilance]], a crystalline core that grants him his remarkable longevity.

### The Long Watch
For over 300 years, Eternal has maintained the [[Ancient Treasury of Tides]], cataloging every item, protecting against intrusions, and ensuring the preservation of countless artifacts. He has witnessed the rise and fall of [[Noble Houses]], the changing of political tides, and the evolution of [[Aquabyssos]] itself. This vast experience has made him incredibly knowledgeable about the city's history and the true nature of many "lost" artifacts.

### Current Role
Today, Eternal serves as both guardian and curator. He has developed relationships with legitimate scholars, treasure hunters, and historians, offering his services as a repository of knowledge and, occasionally, access to certain non-critical items in exchange for new additions to the collection or services that benefit the vault's security.

### The Vault's Trials
For those seeking access to the more valuable sections of the [[Ancient Treasury of Tides]], Eternal administers three trials:

1. **The Trial of Knowledge:** Answering complex riddles about [[Aquabyssos]] history and magical theory
2. **The Trial of Intent:** Demonstrating worthy purpose through magical truth detection
3. **The Trial of Contribution:** Providing the vault with something of equal or greater value than what is sought

## Personality & Quirks

Despite his constructed nature, centuries of interaction have given Eternal distinct personality traits:

- **Methodical:** He approaches every situation with careful analysis and systematic thinking
- **Honorable:** His word is his bond, and he has never broken a properly negotiated agreement
- **Curious:** Despite his vast knowledge, he remains fascinated by new discoveries and innovations
- **Protective:** Extremely defensive of both his vault and those under his protection
- **Patient:** Capable of waiting decades to see long-term plans come to fruition

### The Missing Codex
Recently, Eternal discovered that the [[Codex of Forgotten Depths]], a crucial historical document, has gone missing from the vault. He suspects inside knowledge was involved and is quietly investigating while seeking trustworthy agents to help recover it.

### The Successor Question
As magical technology advances, some in [[Aquabyssos]] question whether a centuries-old construct should continue guarding their most precious treasures. Eternal is aware of these discussions and is preparing contingencies while seeking to prove his continued relevance.

### The Deep Awakening
Strange tremors from the deep ocean have activated ancient warning systems in the vault. Eternal believes something significant is stirring in the depths and needs adventurers to investigate while he maintains the vault's defenses.

### The Collector's Gambit
A mysterious figure known only as [[The Collector]] has been attempting to acquire specific artifacts from the vault through various proxies. Eternal seeks to uncover this individual's identity and motivations before agreeing to any transactions.
