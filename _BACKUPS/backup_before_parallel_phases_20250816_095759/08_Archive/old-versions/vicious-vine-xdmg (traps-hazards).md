--- # Vicious Vine

*Generic Hazard* Vicious vines are animated by magic. They often cling to doorways, archways, walls, and statuary. Until a vicious vine moves, there's nothing to distinguish it from an iimate vine. Each vicious vine has AC 11; HP 16; and Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Psychic damage. When a creature enters a space within 5 feet of the vine for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the vine tries to coil around that creature. The target must succeed on a **DC 12** Dexterity saving throw or have the [[conditions#Grappled|Grappled condition (escape **DC 12**). While Grappled in this way, the target takes 5 (`d10`) Necrotic damage from the vine's life-draining thorns at the start of each of the target's turns. The vine can grapple only one creature at a time. As an [actions#Influence|Influence]] action, a character under the effect of a [[Speak With Plants Xphb spell or similar magic can try to persuade the vine to release its victim, doing so with a successful **DC 10** Charisma ([skills#Persuasion|Persuasion]]) check. A creature released by the vine in this way won't be attacked by that vine again for the next 24 hours. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## At Higher Levels You can scale the hazard for higher levels by increasing the Necrotic damage, the save DC, and the escape DC, as shown in the following table. | Levels | Necrotic Damage | Save/Escape DC |

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of vicious vine xdmg as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around vicious vine xdmg. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - The authorities needs help investigating before the new moon
