# Hobgoblin
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 282*  


- **Ability Scores**: None
- **Size**: Medium
- **Speed**: 30 ft.

## Traits

### Martial Advantage

Once per turn, you can deal an extra `2d6` damage to a creature you hit with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 ft. of an ally of yours that isn't [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Incapacitated|incapacitated]].

### Darkvision

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin.

## Player-Facing Summary

Hobgoblin dmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of hobgoblin dmg as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around hobgoblin dmg.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties hobgoblin dmg to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at hobgoblin dmg to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to hobgoblin dmg active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
