## Fighter

Fighters rule many battlefields. Questing knights, royal champions, elite soldiers, and hardened mercenariesâ€”as Fighters, they all share an unparalleled prowess with weapons and armor. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and defying it.

Fighters master various weapon techniques, and a well-equipped Fighter always has the right tool at hand for any combat situation. Likewise, a Fighter is adept with every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each Fighter specializes in certain styles of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad ability and extensive specialization makes Fighters superior combatants.

## Class Features

### Fighting Style (Level 1)

You have honed your martial prowess and gain a Fighting Style feat of your choice. [[defense-xphb|Defense]] is recommended.

Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace the feat you chose with a different Fighting Style feat.

### Second Wind (Level 1)

You have a limited well of physical and mental stamina that you can draw on. As a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]], you can use it to regain [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] equal to `d10` plus your Fighter level.

You can use this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a [[short-rest-xphb|Short Rest]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]].

When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain more uses of this feature, as shown in the Second Wind column of the Fighter Features table.

### Weapon Mastery (Level 1)

Your training with weapons allows you to use the [[weapon-mastery-properties-xphb|mastery properties]] of three kinds of Simple or Martial weapons of your choice. Whenever you finish a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]], you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.

When you reach certain Fighter levels, you gain the ability to use the [[weapon-mastery-properties-xphb|mastery properties]] of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the [[weapon-xphb|Weapon]] Mastery column of the Fighter Features table.

### Action Surge (Level 2)

You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action, except the [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a [[short-rest-xphb|Short]] or [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]]. Starting at level 17, you can use it twice before a rest but only once on a turn.

### Tactical Mind (Level 2)

You have a mind for tactics on and off the battlefield. When you fail an ability check, you can expend a use of your Second Wind to push yourself toward success. Rather than regaining [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]], you roll `d10` and add the number rolled to the ability check, potentially turning it into a success. If the check still fails, this use of Second Wind isn't expended.

### Fighter Subclass (Level 3)

You gain a Fighter subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Fighter levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Fighter level or lower.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 4)

You gain the [[ability-score-improvement-xphb|Ability Score Improvement]] feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Fighter levels 6, 8, 12, 14, and 16.

### Extra Attack (Level 5)

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [[actions#Attack|Attack]] action on your turn.

### Tactical Shift (Level 5)

Whenever you activate your Second Wind with a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]], you can move up to half your [[speed-xphb|Speed]] without provoking [[actions#Opportunity%20Attack|Opportunity Attacks]].

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 6)

You gain the [[ability-score-improvement-xphb|Ability Score Improvement]] feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

### Subclass Feature (Level 7)

You gain a feature from your Fighter Subclass.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 8)

You gain the [[ability-score-improvement-xphb|Ability Score Improvement]] feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

### Indomitable (Level 9)

If you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Fighter level. You must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]].

You can use this feature twice before a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]] starting at level 13 and three times before a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]] starting at level 17.

### Tactical Master (Level 9)

When you attack with a weapon whose mastery property you can use, you can replace that property with the [[item-mastery#Push|Push]], [[item-mastery#Sap|Sap]], or [[item-mastery#Slow|Slow]] property for that attack.

### Subclass Feature (Level 10)

You gain a feature from your Fighter Subclass.

### Two Extra Attacks (Level 11)

You can attack three times instead of once whenever you take the [[actions#Attack|Attack]] action on your turn.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 12)

You gain the [[ability-score-improvement-xphb|Ability Score Improvement]] feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

### Indomitable (Level 13)

If you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Fighter level. You must use the new roll, and you can't use this feature again until you finish a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]].

You can use this feature twice before a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]] starting at level 13 and three times before a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]] starting at level 17.

### Studied Attacks (Level 13)

You study your opponents and learn from each attack you make. If you make an attack roll against a creature and miss, you have [[advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 14)

You gain the [[ability-score-improvement-xphb|Ability Score Improvement]] feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

### Subclass Feature (Level 15)

You gain a feature from your Fighter Subclass.

### Ability Score Improvement (Level 16)

You gain the [[ability-score-improvement-xphb|Ability Score Improvement]] feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify.

### Action Surge (Level 17)

You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action, except the [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action.

Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a [[short-rest-xphb|Short]] or [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]]. Starting at level 17, you can use it twice before a rest but only once on a turn.

### Indomitable (Level 17)

### Epic Boon (Level 19)

You can attack four times instead of once whenever you take the [[actions#Attack|Attack]] action on your turn.
