Only vague limbs and anguished features jut from these slurries of infernal proto-matter.```statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of swarm of lemures xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around swarm of lemures xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is blackmailing a artifact for money
