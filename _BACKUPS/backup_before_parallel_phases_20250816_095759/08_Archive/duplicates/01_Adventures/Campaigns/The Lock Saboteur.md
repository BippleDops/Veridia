## Overview

[The Lock]] - the massive arcane barrier holding back the creatures of [[Hadal Depth]] - has begun showing signs of systematic sabotage. Power fluctuations, missing security personnel, and disturbing whispers in the deep suggest an inside job. If the Lock fails completely, the horrors beneath will surge upward and consume all of [[Aquabyssos.

## Background

[Admiral Thorne Blackwater]] first noticed unusual readings from the Lock's monitoring stations. What seemed like normal degradation revealed itself as deliberate tampering when [[Vault Keeper Eternal found crystalline components that had been carefully weakened rather than naturally worn. Someone with intimate knowledge of the Lock's construction is methodically destroying it from within.

### Phase 1: Understanding the Lock (1 session)

**Location:** [The Lock]] - Surface Systems
**Objective:** Learn how the Lock functions and identify sabotage patterns

**The Lock's Structure:**
- **Crystalline Core**: Seven massive [[Seven Shards fragments channeling barrier energy
- **Pressure Systems**: Mechanical components maintaining structural integrity
- **Ritual Chambers**: Ongoing ceremonies that reinforce magical bindings
- **Monitoring Network**: Sensory apparatus detecting threats from below
- **[[Emergency Protocol|[Emergency Protocol]]s]]**: Last-resort systems for catastrophic failure

**[[Evidence of Sabotage:**
1. **Micro-fractures**: Crystalline supports show tool marks, not wear patterns
2. **Ritual Disruption**: Sacred ceremonies interrupted by "equipment failures"
3. **Missing Personnel**: Three technicians vanished during routine maintece
4. **Modified Components**: Replacement parts deliberately weakened before installation
5. **Memory Gaps**: Staff experiencing unexplained lapses in recollection

### Phase 2: Deep Investigation (1 session)

**Location:** [The Lock]] - Lower Levels, [[Pressure's End
**Objective:** Identify the saboteur and their methods

**[Suspects]] to Investigate:**
- **[[Engineer Brass Gearspin**: Has complete access and technical knowledge
- **[Drowned]]]]**: Religious extremist with philosophical motive
- **New Technician "[[Coral"**: Recent hire with suspicious background
- **[Memory Farmers]] Agent**: Could be erasing evidence of their infiltration
- **Deep Cultist**: Someone corrupted by exposure to abyssal influence

**Investigation Methods:**
- **Technical Analysis**: Examine sabotage techniques for signature patterns
- **Personnel Records**: Background checks reveal hidden connections
- **Memory Examination**: Magical investigation of staff amnesia
- **Temporal Analysis**: [[Time can detect [Timeline]] manipulations
- **Deep Sensing**: Psychic detection of abyssal corruption in personnel

### The Real Saboteur: Engineer Brass Gearspin

**Motivation:** Believes the Lock is slowly poisoning [[Aquabyssos with leaking abyssal energy
**Method:** Using his access to gradually weaken the barrier in "safe" ways
**Goal:** Force evacuation to surface before the accumulated corruption kills everyone
**Corruption Level:** 60% - partially influenced by abyssal whispers but still rational

**His Plan:**
1. **Controlled Failure**: Create manageable breaches that prove the Lock's danger
2. **Evidence Collection**: Document corruption effects on deep-dwelling citizens
3. **Mass Evacuation**: Convince authorities to relocate population to safety
4. **Selective Destruction**: Destroy the Lock only after [People]] are safe

### Moral Complexity

Brass Gearspin isn't evil - he's genuinely trying to save lives based on disturbing evidence:
- **Pressure Sickness** rates increasing annually
- **Memory degradation** in long-term deep residents
- **Genetic mutations** appearing in newborns near the Lock
- **Psychological disorders** correlating with proximity to abyssal energies

## Phase 3: The Confrontation (1 session)

**Location:** [[The Lock - Core Chamber
**Objective:** Stop the sabotage while addressing legitimate concerns

### Brass Gearspin's Final Gambit

When confronted, Brass reveals his master plan: a "controlled detonation" of the Lock's primary systems that will:
- Create obvious danger requiring evacuation
- Preserve enough barrier function to prevent total catastrophe
- Force authorities to find alternative solutions
- Save lives by removing people from slow corruption

**The Choice:**
- **Stop Him**: Maintain the Lock but ignore growing health crisis
- **Help Him**: Risk catastrophic failure for chance at real solution
- **Find Alternative**: Seek third option that addresses both problems

### Engineer Brass Gearspin (Corrupted)

**CR 9** (5,000 XP)
*Medium humanoid (human), chaotic good (corrupted)*

**Armor Class** 16 (Reinforced Engineer's Coat + Dex)
**Hit Points** 135 (`dice: 18d8` + 54)
**Speed** 30 ft., climb 30 ft. (via magnetic boots)

**STR** | **DEX** | **CON** | **INT** | **WIS** | **CHA**

#### Special Abilities

**Technical Mastery.** Brass can use an action to control any mechanical or magical system within 120 feet, including [The Lock]]'s defenses. This functions as *dominate monster* but only affects constructs and magical systems.

**Abyssal Corruption.** Brass is partially corrupted by exposure to [[Hadal Depths|The [Hadal Depths]]. He has resistance to necrotic and psychic damage but vulnerability to radiant damage. His corruption level fluctuates based on stress.

**Lock System Integration.** While within [[The Lock, Brass can see through any surveillance system and communicate through the facility's intercom as a bonus action.

**Jury-Rigged Mastery.** Brass can spend 10 minutes to create improvised explosive devices from available materials. These function as dynamite but deal an additional `dice: 1d6` necrotic damage from abyssal energy.

**Environmental Hazard Control.** As an action, Brass can activate environmental systems within [The Lock]] to create the following effects within a 30-foot radius:
- *Pressure Drop:* All creatures must make **DC 17** Constitution saves or be stunned for 1 round
- *Power Surge:* Deal 13 (`dice: 3d8`) lightning damage, **DC 17** Dex save for half
- *Gravity Manipulation:* Reverse gravity in the area for 1 minute

#### Actions

**Multiattack.** Brass makes two Corrupted Tools attacks or casts two spells.

**Corrupted Tools.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`dice: 1d8` + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 7 ([[`dice: 2d6`) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a **DC 17** Constitution saving throw or have their maximum hit points reduced by the necrotic damage until they finish a long rest.

**Abyssal Whispers (Recharge 5-6).** Brass shares horrifying visions of [The Hadal Depths]] with a creature within 60 feet. The target must make a **DC 17** Wisdom saving throw. On failure: 22 (`dice: 4d10`) psychic damage and the target is frightened for 1 minute. On success: Half damage and not frightened.

**Jury-Rigged Explosive.** *Ranged Attack:* +7 to hit, range 60/120 ft. *Hit:* All creatures within 15 feet of the target must make a **DC 17** Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (`dice: 4d6`) fire damage and 7 (`dice: 2d6`) necrotic damage on failure, or half on success.

**Emergency Lock Shutdown (1/Day).** Brass begins an emergency shutdown of [[The Lock's primary systems. This is a 3-round ritual. If completed, the barrier fails and creatures from [The Hadal Depths]] begin emerging. The ritual can be interrupted by dealing 25+ damage to Brass in a single turn or by making a successful **DC 20** Arcana check to counter the shutdown.

#### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)

**Move.** Brass moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
**System Control.** Brass activates one Environmental Hazard Control effect.
**Corrupted Strike.** Brass makes one Corrupted Tools attack.
**Desperate Sabotage (Costs 2 Actions).** Brass damages a critical system. If in combat within [[The Lock, all creatures must make a **DC 15** Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (`dice: 2d8`) damage from falling debris.

#### Spellcasting

Brass is a 12th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save **DC 18**, +10 to hit). He knows the following spells:
- **Cantrips (at will):** *mage hand*, *mending*, *prestidigitation*, *minor illusion*
- **1st level (4 slots):** *detect magic*, *identify*, *[Shield]]*
- **2nd level (3 slots):** *knock*, *see invisibility*, *spider climb*
- **3rd level (3 slots):** *counterspell*, *fireball*, *haste*
- **4th level (3 slots):** *fabricate*, *greater invisibility*, *wall of fire*
- **5th level (3 slots):** *animate objects*, *passwall*, *telekinesis*
- **6th level (1 slot):** *disintegrate*, *flesh to stone*

#### Equipment

- **Reinforced Engineer's Coat**: AS 14 + Dex modifier, provides resistance to one type of energy damage per day
- **Magnetic Climbing Boots**: Grant climbing speed and immunity to being knocked prone
- **Master's Toolkit**: Gives advantage on all tool-based checks
- **Abyssal Corruption Focus**: [[Crystal Shard that enhances spells with necrotic energy
- **Lock Master Key**: Allows access to all areas of [The Lock]]

**Tactics:** Brass uses his environmental control to create hazardous conditions while positioning himself to complete critical sabotage. He prioritizes incapacitating enemies over killing them, as he genuinely believes he's saving lives through his actions.

### Option 1: Traditional Stop (Combat Focus)

**Outcome:** Brass Gearspin defeated, sabotage halted, Lock remains functional
- **Immediate Safety**: No catastrophic breach occurs
- **Ongoing Problem**: Health crisis continues to worsen slowly
- **Political Fallout**: Cover-up required to prevent panic
- **Future Consequences**: Problem will resurface in more dangerous form

### Option 2: Collaborative Solution (Investigation Focus)

**Outcome:** Work with Brass to find safer way to address his concerns
- **Research [[Initiative]]**: Major study of Lock's health effects begins
- **Gradual Improvement**: Modified barrier reduces harmful emissions
- **Public Awareness**: Controlled revelation leads to health monitoring
- **Long-term Success**: Engineered solution protects both safety and health

### Option 3: Controlled Evacuation (Social Focus)

**Outcome:** Accept Brass's plan but improve its execution
- **Managed Crisis**: Create obvious but non-lethal Lock failure
- **Planned Relocation**: Organized movement to safer areas
- **Resource Allocation**: Major investment in alternative living spaces
- **New Equilibrium**: Society adapts to different relationship with the depths

### Pacing Recommendations

- **Session 1**: Investigation and growing awareness of moral complexity
- **Session 2**: Deep dive into technical details and suspect motivations
- **Session 3**: Confrontation and resolution with multiple viable solutions

> [!danger] DM Secret
> The Lock was never meant to be permanent. It's a stopgap measure created during an ancient emergency, and it's slowly destabilizing reality itself. Brass Gearspin is partially right - the Lock will eventually fail catastrophically, but his timeline is off by centuries. The real question is whether society should begin preparing for that eventuality now or wait until the crisis becomes undeniable.
