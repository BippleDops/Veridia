# Hyme
## Overview
### Hyme
![[55f5fz1j.u0e.png|Hyme|300]]
[[55f5fz1j.u0e.png|open outside]]

*Superficially it could be a horse — certainly there is some horse in it — but the resemblance is unnatural. It’s a dark thing, a thing the eye finds difficult to rest upon, with the anger and musk of a horse, but the shape is wrong. Its head is dark and long, and slaver drools from it onto the ground. And though it tosses its head like a horse, it has barbed teeth in its jaw.*

## Special Traits
Dislocated: The hyme’s form is made up of memories, which shift and change. The creature is continually under the effect of a blur spell (attacks against it are made with tactical disadvantage unless the attacker has blindsight, truesight, or an equivalent). The hyme can suppress or reactivate this ability at will as a bonus action.

Distorted: A hyme’s internal anatomy varies from individual to individual and seldom makes any biological sense. Critical hits against a hyme do a flat +1 damage but don’t roll damage dice twice.

**Musk of Fear (1/day):** As a bonus action, a hyme emits an unpleasant musk. All breathing creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 12 Con saving throw or be poisoned while within 30 feet of the hyme. The effect lasts 1 minute. A creature that spends its entire turn more than 30 feet from the hyme repeats the saving throw, ending the effect on itself with a success. Other hymes and their masters are immune. Beasts have a -2 modifier on the saving throw; horses save with tactical disadvantage.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The hyme bites once and attacks once with its hooves.

**Melee Attack—Bite:** +6 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d4 + 4` piercing damage.

**Melee Attack—Hooves:** +6 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d6 + 4` bludgeoning damage.

**Area Attack—Bray of Terror (recharge 5-6):** All creatures within 60 of the hyme and that can hear it must make a successful DC 12 Wis saving throw or be frightened of the hyme for `dice: 1d4` rounds. Other hymes and their masters are immune. Beasts have a -2 modifier on the saving throw; horses save with tactical disadvantage. A creature that saves successfully is immune to Bray of Terror for 24 hours.

## Description
**Environment**: Plains, swamp (Between)

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, or herd (3–12)

The first hyme came about one terrible night when a creature from Between was captured and held in a stable. Whilst the greedy captors sought to sell their prize to those who collect such creatures in peculiar menageries, something terrible happened, and when the hunters returned they simply found the creature gone and the horses within mad with terror. Cursing their bad luck, the hunters looked for new prey. A few months later, each mare in the stable birthed a horrible dark thing that resembled a foal but was certainly not of this world. The hunters went back to their original purchaser with their new creatures and sold them. These were the first hymes.

A bastard union of the Between and the horse, the hyme combines the qualities of a horse with the aggression of a [[Between Creature|Between creature]]. They are hard to tame, but not impossible, and broken ones now regularly pull coarse cabs around the city. Initially, such terrible dray were the exclusive property of those aristocrats who could afford them, but their prodigious appetites created more hymes from unions with mares (hymes are born to both hyme-hyme and hyme-horse parents). They are now seen regularly, but most often on dark nights.

Hymes command very high prices, and are extremely rare to find for sale. Occasionally, one becomes available, but generally only particular dealers — such as Groppit, Swift & Humb: Hyme Dealers by Royal Appointment — sell them. A hyme sells for 6,500 gp.
