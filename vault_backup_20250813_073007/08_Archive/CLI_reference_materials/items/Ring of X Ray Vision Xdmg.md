# Ring of X-ray Vision
*Ring, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/ring-of-x-ray-vision.webp#right)


While wearing this ring, you can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action to gain X-ray vision with a range of 30 feet for 1 minute. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don't prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances or a thin sheet of lead block the vision.

Whenever you use the ring again before taking a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]], you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] level.
