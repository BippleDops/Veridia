# Drow High Magic
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 74*  

**Prerequisite**: [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/races/elf-xphb|Elf]]

You learn more of the magic typical of dark elves. You learn the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-magic-xphb|detect magic]] spell and can cast it at will, without expending a spell slot. You also learn [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/levitate-xphb|levitate]] and [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic-xphb|dispel magic]], each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast those two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.
