--- # Treasure by Depth *"The deeper you dare descend, the greater the rewards that await."* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Treasure by Depth is a systematic approach to distributing rewards based on the dangerous depths explored in Aquabyssos. This system recognizes that deeper areas require greater risk, preparation, and skill, and should provide proportionally valuable rewards including rare materials, powerful magical items, and unique artifacts unavailable at shallower depths. ### Duration

Permanent system governing treasure distribution throughout campaign. ## Adventure Hooks

1. **Deep Treasure Map**: Ancient chart shows treasures at extreme depths
2. **Pressure Vault**: Secure treasure storage in deepest zones
3. **Salvage Operation**: Recover valuable cargo from deep wreckage ## Campaign Use


Provides mechanical framework for encouraging exploration while maintaining appropriate challenge-reward ratios. ## Player-Facing Summary Treasure by Depth is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Treasure by Depth as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Treasure by Depth. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Secret Covenant - Summon ancient evil ## Related Notes - [[Similar Topic 1]]
