Practical, table-ready rules for Memory Tide Navigation across Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. ## Player-Facing Summary Memory Tide Navigation is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Memory Tide Navigation as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Memory Tide Navigation. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.*
