# Vault Consolidation Report

## Directories Removed
- 03_Mechanics
- 05_Player_Characters
- 09_Performance
- 05_Player_Characters
- Players

## Files Consolidated
- 02_Worldbuilding/People → 03_People
- 02_Worldbuilding/Groups → 03_People/Factions
- 00_Indexes → _INDEXES
- 12_Research → 04_Resources/Research

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Review 03_People vs 02_Worldbuilding/People** - Significant duplication
2. **Standardize naming** - Choose either underscores or hyphens
3. **Flatten deep nesting** - Some files are 5+ levels deep
4. **Create _SCRIPTS directory** - Move all Python scripts there
5. **Audit stub files** - Many placeholder files could be removed
