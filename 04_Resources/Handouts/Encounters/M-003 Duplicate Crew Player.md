# Duplicate Crew Arrival

The hatch opens and you walk in—soaked, shaking, claiming to be five minutes ahead of yourself.

What you notice
- Clothes and gear slightly wrong
- A story that matches yours—almost

What you can try
- Keep calm and talk
- Check details
- Keep the ship safe while you decide

Possible outcomes
- Two versions of you work together
- Tense standoff
- A fight you didn’t want
