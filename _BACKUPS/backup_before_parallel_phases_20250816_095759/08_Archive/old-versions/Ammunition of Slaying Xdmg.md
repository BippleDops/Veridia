--- # Ammunition of Slaying

*Ammunition, very rare* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/ammunition-of-slaying.webp#right) This magic ammunition is meant to slay creatures of a particular type, which the DM chooses or determines randomly by rolling on the table below. If a creature of that type takes damage from the ammunition, the creature makes a **DC 17** Constitution saving throw, taking an extra``dice: 6d10``Force damage on a failed save or half as much extra damage on a successful one. After dealing its extra damage to a creature, the ammunition becomes nonmagical.`dice: [](ammunition-of-slaying-xdmg.md#^1-creature-type)`| dice: `dice: 1d100` | Creature Type |
