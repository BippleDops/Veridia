## Description

Sword wraith warriors are most often found on ancient battlefields where soldiers were hemmed in and slaughtered without quarter.

**Sword Wraiths.** When glory-obsessed warriors die in battle without honor, they might haunt the site as sword wraiths.

## Environment

grassland, swamp
