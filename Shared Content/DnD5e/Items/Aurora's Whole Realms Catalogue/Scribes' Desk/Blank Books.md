## Description
We have a remarkable assortment of blank books for ledger-keeping, notetaking, or just diaries and journals. Our most common cover style is leather-covered suthwood, but we also offer suthwood uncovered, as well as cloth (5% off table below), felt (15% over table cost), and even some exotic skins and furs (check on what is available when ordering, minimum of 500 gp over cost, depending on size and page length). We offer regular books (9 inches by 12 inches), and also a special “tome” size, which is useful for displaying prominently to impress guests (15 inches by 20 inches). We provide a variety of page numbers in our books: 25, 50, 75, 100, 200, and 500.

| **Number of pages:** | **Reg.** | **Tome** |
|---|---|---|
| 25 | 50 gp | 75 gp |
| 50 | 90 gp | 135 gp |
| 75 | 125 gp | 180 gp |
| 100 | 175 gp | 250 gp |
| 200 | 300 gp | 450 gp |
| 500 | 725 gp | 1000 gp |

The above table of costs applies to books with parchment pages. For books with paper, the cost must be doubled. Sorry, we do not offer bound books with papyrus pages.

## Additional Details
Example: a character wants to buy a book, made with paper, that is regular size and 200 pages. Furthermore, he wishes it bound in felt. Therefore, the base cost, 300 gp (from the table) is first multiplied by 1.15 (for felt), resulting in 345 gp, then doubled (for paper pages) for 690 gp.
