*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 97*  

A Trebuchet is a catapult that throws its payload in a high arc so it can hit targets behind walls. Loading a Trebuchet requires two [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] actions, and aiming it requires two more [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] actions. Then a crew member can take the Trebuchet Stone action.
