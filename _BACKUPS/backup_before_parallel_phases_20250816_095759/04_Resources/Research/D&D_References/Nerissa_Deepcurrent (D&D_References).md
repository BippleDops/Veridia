--- > [!figure] Portrait ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Description Nerissa appears ageless, though she has ruled for nearly two centuries. Her silver hair flows constantly as if underwater even in air pockets, and her skin has a subtle pearl-like shimmer. She wears robes woven from crystallized water that shift and flow with her movements. Her eyes change color with her emotions - deep blue when calm, storm green when angered, grey when sorrowful. ## Background Born into the Oracle bloodline that predicted the Great Submersion, Nerissa was raised from birth to lead Aquabyssos. She witnessed the last days of the surface empire through inherited memories and carries the weight of three thousand years of isolation. Her grandmother was the last Oracle to speak with [[Emperor Thalassius the Wise before his sacrifice. ### The Second Rising Prophecy

Her own visions show two paths:
1. Aquabyssos rises and burns in the sun
2. Aquabyssos stays and drowns in darkness

She seeks a third option but hasn't found it. ### Secret Projects

1. **Project Surface Light:** Building surface observation posts
2. **The Third Path:** Seeking way to partially surface Aquabyssos
3. **Memory Preservation:** Recording pre-Submersion history
4. **Void Research:** Investigating if the threat still exists ### [Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]]
