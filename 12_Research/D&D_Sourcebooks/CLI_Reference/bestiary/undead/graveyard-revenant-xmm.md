## Revets

*Vengeance from beyond the Grave*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Swamp, Urban  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Wrathful spirits bent on revenge, revets possess corpses and other materials, using them to seek justice or vent their rage on those who wronged them. Revets refuse to rest until those they seek to punish are no more. If their bodies are destroyed, revets claim new forms and continue their ruthless quests.
