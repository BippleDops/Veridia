# Possession
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 372. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* 

Some effects cause a creature to be possessed by another creature or entity. A possessing effect defines how the possession operates. Possession can be prevented by the [[protection from evil and good xphb|Protection from Evil and Good]] spell and ended by the [[dispel evil and good xphb|Dispel Evil and Good]] spell.
