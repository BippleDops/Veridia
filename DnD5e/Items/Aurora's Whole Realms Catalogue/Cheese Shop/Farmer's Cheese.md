## Description
Also called pot cheese or cottage cheese, Farmer’s Cheese is a simple cheese, little more than aged milk strained through a cheesecloth sieve and drained of most of its whey into large curds. Popular throughout the small farming communities of the Realms, it is usually made and consumed locally, as it does not travel well. An order of Farmer’s Cheese from Aurora’s will result in delivery of the freshest cheese possible, regardless of location. Serve it with salt and pepper for a light meal, or add cream for a rich side-dish with supper. Available wrapped in muslin in 1 lb lots (3 sp).
