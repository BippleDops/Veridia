## Secrets and Hidden Aspects

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Memory Threads
> [[Coral Silkweaver]] has developed a revolutionary technique using threads woven from processed memories, allowing garments to grant wearers temporary knowledge or skills from previous owners. This technique is kept absolutely secret, used only for the most trusted clients and most critical situations. The memory threads can transfer anything from language skills to combat techniques, but the process is dangerous and imperfect, sometimes transferring unwanted memories or personality traits along with desired abilities.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Spy Network
> The Silkweaver Atelier unknowingly serves as a hub for an international fashion spy network. Several master seamstresses working in different fashion houses across multiple kingdoms use clothing fittings and fashion communications to pass intelligence about political developments, military preparations, and economic plans. [[Coral Silkweaver]] is unaware of this network, which operates through coded patterns sewn into garments and secret messages hidden in fashion trend communications.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Cursed Collection
> Hidden in the deepest archives of the atelier is a collection of garments created by [[Coral Silkweaver]]'s predecessor, each one cursed with powerful magic that reflects the emotional state in which it was created. These garments are incredibly beautiful and functional, but wearing them subjects the wearer to the intense emotions that were woven into the fabric during creation. Some cause uncontrollable rage, others profound melancholy, and one is said to inspire such overwhelming love that the wearer becomes completely obsessed with the first person they see.
