Intricate engravings of sea creatures and nautical symbols cover the case, while the face is made of an iridescent material that shifts between deep blue and silver. The compass was recovered from the last known position of the merchant vessel *Golden Current*, floating alone in eerily calm waters. Its previous owner, Captain Elena Swiftwater, was renowned for never losing her way at sea. ## Properties **Requires Attunement** While attuned to this compass, you gain the following benefits: ### Find the Lost

As an action, you can activate the compass to point toward the nearest missing person, lost object, or hidden location within 5 miles. The needle glows with a faint blue light and points steadily in the correct direction for 1 hour or until you reach your target. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest. ### Navigate the Unknown When making Wisdom (Survival) checks to navigate or avoid getting lost, you have advantage on the roll. Additionally, you always know which direction is north, even in areas where conventional compasses fail (such as extraplanar locations). ### Detect Supernatural Interference

The compass needle spins wildly when you're within 100 feet of active magic that manipulates location, transportation, or navigation. This includes effects like *teleportation circle*, *transport via plants*, dimensional rifts, and similar magic. ### Harbor's Memory

When you're within sight of any large body of water (ocean, large lake, major river), you can spend 10 minutes concentrating with the compass to learn one of the following pieces of information:
- The most recent vessel to pass through these waters
- Whether any ships have gone missing in this area in the past month
- The general direction to the nearest active port or harbor
- If these waters have been affected by supernatural phenomena recently You can use this feature once per day. ## Curse **The Wayward Path**: While attuned to this compass, you have disadvantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks made to retrace your steps or return to a location you've previously visited. The compass seems to prefer leading you toward the unknown rather than the familiar. Additionally, you feel compelled to investigate any missing persons or mysterious disappearances you learn about. When you become aware of such a mystery, you must make a **DC 13** Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you become obsessed with solving the mystery and have disadvantage on ability checks not related to the investigation until the mystery is resolved or 7 days pass. ## History & Lore **History (**DC 15**)**: This compass belonged to Captain Elena Swiftwater of the merchant vessel *Golden Current*. Elena was famous among harbor folk for having an uncanny ability to find lost ships and missing persons. **History (**DC 20**)**: The compass was crafted by Tideweaver Magistrum, a renowned artificer who specialized in nautical magic items. It was commissioned by the Harbor Guild after a series of mysterious disappearances 30 years ago. **Arcana (**DC 18**)**: The iridescent face of the compass contains crushed pearls from deep-sea creatures that exist partially in the Ethereal Plane, explaining its ability to detect supernatural phenomena. **Investigation (**DC 16**)**: Examining the compass reveals tiny scratches inside the case forming letters that spell out "Find them all" - a message seemingly carved by a desperate hand. ### The Vanishing Merchant Vessels

This compass is a key piece of evidence in the investigation. It may hold clues about what happened to the missing ships and could lead the party to their fate. ### Future Adventures

The compass's compulsion to investigate mysteries makes it an excellent plot hook generator. The DM can use its curse to naturally draw the party toward new adventures and unsolved cases. ## Combat Applications While not primarily a combat item, the compass can provide tactical advantages:

- Detecting invisible or magically hidden enemies who use teleportation
- Finding escape routes or hidden passages during chase scenes
- Locating missing allies who have been captured or separated ## Upgrade Potential At the DM's discretion, the compass could evolve with use: **Enhanced (Very Rare)**: Find the Lost range increases to 25 miles, and you can use it twice per long rest. **Legendary**: Gain the ability to cast *locate creature* (**DC 17**) once per day, targeting anyone whose true name you speak while holding the compass. --- ## DM Notes This item is designed to:

- **Advance the current mystery** while providing ongoing utility
- **Generate future plot hooks** through its curse mechanics
- **Reward investigation** with practical benefits
- **Create interesting choices** between convenience and compulsion **Balance Considerations**: The curse prevents the item from being too powerful for navigation while adding story-driving compulsions. The daily/long rest limitations keep the abilities useful but not overwhelming. **Story Integration**: Use the compass to introduce new mysteries when the campaign needs direction, but be prepared for players to become genuinely invested in solving every missing persons case they encounter. --- *"Some say the compass doesn't find what you're looking for - it finds what needs to be found. Whether that's a blessing or a curse depends on how comfortable you are with the unknown."* - Harbormaster Willem Tidecaller ## Player-Facing Summary Harbor Master's Compass is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
