## Description
Our costume kits contain everything a thief needs to slip by unobtrusively. A vial of tree sap allows the goat-hair moustache or beard to be easily attached. The soft felt hat can assume many shapes and the linen coif doubles as a decorative hood. A coal pad darkens skin and adds dramatic shadows, while the chalk stick lightens and highlights skin. The pack even includes a wad of clay that can be shaped and colored to make a false nose or chin, or higher cheekbones. (20 gp)
