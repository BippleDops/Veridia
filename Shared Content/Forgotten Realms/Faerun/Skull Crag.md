# Skull Crag
Skull Crag is a human hamlet in the Storm Horns to the northwest of Cormyr. It is a mining community with a population of 270. The settlement is overshadowed by a large rock that has been made into a shrine to Kelemvor.

Dark Wind Pass leads east through the mountains to Minroe. The High Road (Cormyr) leads south to Old Axe or north towards Eagle Peak.

### Volo's Guide to Cormyr
This large fortified village of over 2,000 folk fills a flat-topped spur of Old Blind Mage Mountain and overlooks the High Road, commanding a view up and down it for miles. This location makes Skull Crag an ideal military base. Over half the Crag's folk are Purple Dragons who patrol up and down the road and in the skies over the Storm Horns. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">To patrol the air, they use a flight of hippogriffs and the aid of a tower staffed by no less than nine War Wizards</mark> .

All this military might protects anyone else settling here. Shepherds and miners have both come in force, claiming the rolling fields north of the village and Old Blind Mage Mountain, respectively. They feed local mouths with meat to spare and delve for iron, nickel, and copper. Excess meat is preserved by magic and sold to passing merchants. Local miners speak of a lost mine in the peaks east of Old Blind Mage, but no one in living memory has found it. Expeditions that set out to search for it are growing increasingly dangerous as peryton and other predators move into the area, attracted by the continued presence of numerous sheep and humans.

Adventurers are being hired to scour the mountain heights of monsters and go seeking lost mines and caverns. There's even local talk of using titanic magic to blast a pass east right through the Storm Horns into Cormyr's heartlands through the low mountains south of the Crag. This plan gives many Purple Dragon officers fits whenever they hear of it.
