## Description
Bahgtru, son of Gruumsh and Luthic, is the ore deity of unbridled strength. Legend says Bahgtru needed a mount as fierce as him for making war, so he sought a mighty aurochs, subjugated the creature with his bare hands, and hauled it to Nishrek, Gruumsh's realm. Bahgtru named the beast Kazaht, or "Bull" in Ore. On Kazaht's bare back, Bahgtru charges into battle, ramming into an enemy host and leaping over the aurochs's horns to land in the midst of his foes.

Ores that revere Bahgtru might tend a stable of war bulls that carry them into combat. Trained to be fierce mounts from a young age, aurochs are sacred symbols of Bahgtru. No ore will eat such creatures, which are treated as honored warriors when they perish.
