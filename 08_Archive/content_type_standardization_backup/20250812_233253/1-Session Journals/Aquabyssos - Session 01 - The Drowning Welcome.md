- Shadow independence manifestation

- Social encounter with Emperor's eels
- Investigation of quarters

### NPCs to Include
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Senator Glaucus|02 Worldbuilding/People/Senator Glaucus]] - Shadow-replaced host

## Session Timeline

### Opening Scene
**Location:** [[Abyssos Prime - Pressure Terminal]]
**Time:** Midday (though sunlight doesn't reach here)
**Description:** 
The party materializes from liquid form in the Pressure Terminal's reconstitution chambers. One member's shadow reforms a second late, moving independently for just a moment. Terminal guards check "molecular integrity" while making notes about shadow irregularities. Graffiti in Aquabyssos script on the walls reads: "The Harvest Comes."

> **Read Aloud:** "Your consciousness snaps back like a rubber band as your body reconstitutes from liquid. The sensation is wrong—like being poured into a mold that doesn't quite fit. As you solidify, you notice your shadow on the curved glass wall. For just a moment, it waves while your hand remains still."

### Key Events

#### Event 1: The Emperor's Court
**Location:** [[Throne of Bubbles]]
**NPCs:** [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Scattered Emperor|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Scattered Emperor]], [[Marina Red Tide Coralheart - Aquabyssos]]

**Outcome:** 
- Emperor speaks through electric eel collective
- Each eel contains personality fragment
- Warning about shadows: "Trust nothing that casts shadows"
- Marina introduced as adapted guide
- Bubbles containing last breaths reveal shadow murders

**Emperor's Fragmented Dialogue:**
- Eel 1: "We—"
- Eel 2: "—welcome—"
- Eel 3: "—you but—"
- Eel 4: "—trust nothing—"
- Eel 5: "—that casts—"
- Eel 6: "—shadows."

#### Event 2: The Dissolution
**Location:** [[Parliament of Echoes - Public Gallery]]
**NPCs:** [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Senator Glaucus|02 Worldbuilding/People/Senator Glaucus]], dissolving Senator Hadrian
**Witness Horror:** DC 13 WIS save or frightened for 1 minute
**Outcome:**
- Senator Hadrian screams and melts into living shadow

#### Event 3: Quarters Assignment

- Mirrors show shadows performing different actions
- Evidence someone entered rooms before arrival
- Waterfalls flow upward into ceiling pools

### Closing Scene
**Location:** [[Inverted Ballroom Wing - Party Quarters]]
**Time:** Night cycle (artificial darkness)
**Cliffhanger:** 
Party members wake to find their shadows standing at the foot of their beds, perfectly still, watching them. One shadow holds a knife. Marina bursts in: "Don't move. Don't even breathe. If you acknowledge them, they become real." Through the window, dozens of shadows dance in the Inverted Ballroom without their owners.
