## Description
Gillmonkeys are nasty, monkeylike creatures that live in the sea. They are native to saltwater, but they sometimes swim up rivers and into lakes to hunt or raid. They have hairless, pinkish-brown skin that is lightly scaled. Short appendages like tentacles grow from the tops of their heads, but they seem to be used only for handling food.

Gillmonkeys never fight alone; if someone is attacked by one gillmonkey, they will be attacked by more. Individually, gillmonkeys are weak and cowardly (more generous observers might call them shy), but in groups they can be quite dangerous—and they always travel in groups. When they attack, they swarm over a ship’s rails like waves crashing up from the sea.
