## Description
This beer, its containers stamped with a brand of a cyclops’ head, is brewed in Llorbauth on the southern coast of the Deepwash, just north of the Thornwood. The local brewer, a retired half-elf fighter/mage named Araneth Idogyr, learned the recipe from a cyclops he met and, strangely, befriended during the local Goblin Wars of 1358 DR. This relatively new brew is akin to the lagers of Calimshan—lighter and less opaque than the standard stouts of the North, but with a higher alcohol content. Old One Eye’s fiery red color comes from its secret brewing process. (Rumors mention pepper and other minute spices in the grain mix.) Its odd “hot” aftertaste makes this beer a one-of-a-kind drink. It is gaining quite a following among the locals and adventurers south of Cormyr, and tavern keepers like it for its long life and ease of travel. Hand keg, 15 cp; cask, 1 gp; barrel, 3 gp; butt, 7 gp; tun, 15 gp.
