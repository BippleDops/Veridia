## Special Traits
***Martial Advantage.*** Once per turn, the hobgoblin can deal an extra 10 (`dice: 3d6`) damage to a creature it hits with a weapon attack if that creature is within 5 ft. of an ally of the hobgoblin that isn't incapacitated.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The hobgoblin makes two greatsword attacks.

***Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (`dice: 2d6+2`) slashing damage.

***Javelin.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d6+2`) piercing damage.

***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the hobgoblin can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 ft. of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a `dice: d4` to its roll provided it can hear and understand the hobgoblin. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the hobgoblin is incapacitated.
