# Year Stealing (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *8th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 hour

**Range**: 1 mile

**Components**: V, S, M (the blood of the in-tended victim, a glass screen, and a black candle)

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
You take the blood and use it to inscribe ritualistic runes on the screen, all the while holding the lit candle. At the end of the casting, the creatureâ€™s whose blood you are using must make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 6d6 necrotic damage and your age is reduced by a number of years equal to half the amount of damage inflicted. If the creature takes enough damage to kill it, it will look as though it died of old age.
