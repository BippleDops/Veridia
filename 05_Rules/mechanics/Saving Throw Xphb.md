--- # Saving Throw

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 373. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* A saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to avoid or resist a threat. You normally make a saving throw only when a rule requires you to do so, but you can decide to fail the save without rolling. The result of a save is detailed in the effect that allowed it. If a target is forced to make a save and lacks the ability score used by it, the target automatically fails. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Saving throw xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.

Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around saving throw xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
