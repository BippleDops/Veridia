# Bad Medicine (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *9th-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 400 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a bundle of indigenous herbs, the claw of an eagle, and the venom of a poisonous snake)

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
You pick a point within range. All creatures within a 100-foot radius of that point are cursed, unless a Wisdom saving throw is made. On a success, the curse fails to take hold. On a failure, all creatures within that radius are at disadvantage for all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. You may dismiss this spell at any time. This spell can also be countered by a *remove curse* or similar spell, but each affected creature must be targeted separately.
