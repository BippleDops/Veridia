## Special Traits
**Frightful Howl:** As an action, a shadow mastiff can emit a terrifying, otherworldly howl that conjures nightmare visions in those who hear it. All living creatures within 300 feet of the shadow mastiff that hear its howl must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for `dice: 3d6` rounds. While frightened, the creature must move away from the shadow mastiff as rapidly as possible, until its far enough away that it cant hear the howling at all (not just beyond the howls effective 300-foot range).

**Shadow Affinity:** A shadow mastiff has tactical advantage on Dex (Stealth) checks in dim light or darkness, and it can make a Stealth check to become hidden as a bonus action anytime it is in darkness or dim light. A shadow mastiff suffers the effect of being poisoned while in bright light.

## Actions
**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (`dice: 2d6+2`) piercing damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any land

**Organization**: Hunting pack (4–16)

## Description
Shadow mastiffs are large dogs resembling normal mastiffs but seemingly composed of solid shadow. The existence of these and similar shadow creatures leads some scholars to posit the existence of an entire Plane of Shadow, but such conjectures are scoffed at by more experienced travelers of the multiverse. There’s no denying, however, that the glossy black coats and powerful jaws of these creatures have the look of shadow about them. What’s more, when a shadow mastiff is killed, its body rapidly “evaporates” into wisps of ectoplasmic darkness that flow into any nearby shadows and disappear.

Shadow mastiffs are hunters of the night. They always travel in packs, and except when they are trying to sneak up on prey, their fearful howling is constant. On a quiet night, they can be heard baying from more than a mile away; farther if the wind is right.
