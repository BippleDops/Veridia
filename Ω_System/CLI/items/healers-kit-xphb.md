# Healer's Kit
*Adventuring gear*  


- **Cost**: 5 gp
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

A Healer's Kit has ten uses. As a [Utilize](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Utilize) action, you can expend one of its uses to stabilize an [Unconscious](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Unconscious) creature that has 0 [Hit Points](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) without needing to make a Wisdom ([Medicine](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Medicine)) check.
