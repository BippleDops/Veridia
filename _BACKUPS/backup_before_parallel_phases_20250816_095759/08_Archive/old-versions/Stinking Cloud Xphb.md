*3rd-level, Conjuration* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a rotten egg)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute You create a 20-foot-radius [[Area of Effect Xphb of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud is [Heavily Obscured Xphb]]. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a strong wind (such as the one created by [[Gust of Wind Xphb) disperses it. Each creature that starts its turn in the [Area of Effect Xphb]] must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned condition until the end of the current turn. While [conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] in this way, the creature can't take an action or a [[Action Xphb. **Classes**: [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 321.
