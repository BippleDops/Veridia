# Fog Cloud
*1st-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create a 20-foot-radius [[sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]] of fog centered on a point within range. The [[sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]] is [[heavily-obscured-xphb|Heavily Obscured]]. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (such as one created by [[gust-of-wind-xphb|Gust of Wind]]) disperses it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The fog's radius increases by 20 feet for each spell slot level above 1.
