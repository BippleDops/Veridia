# Pirate Shadow Net

Invisible threads stretch across the water like a spider’s web. Your sensors hiccup; something is waiting beyond.

What you notice
- A flash of filament in the lights
- Sensors stutter, then recover

What you can try
- Spot the snare
- Cut the lines quickly
- Slip around the edge

Possible outcomes
- You clear the way cleanly
- The ship’s eyes go fuzzy
- Hooks thud into the hull
