# Blight Ape
## Overview
### Blight Ape
![[en0pqedk.bp4.png|Blight Ape|300]]
[[en0pqedk.bp4.png|open outside]]

*This creature looks like a strange caricature of a gorilla. Standing barely 4 feet tall, it superficially resembles a tawny-colored version of that animal save for its height. However, the resemblances end there. Rather than the look and posture of an animal, the creature carries itself with a sense of dignity. It stands straight (or as straight as possible for a creature whose knuckles drag the ground), and it wears a formal black vest. Its simian face is carefully composed, with its eyes bearing the look of long-suffering patience of a professional manservant.*

## Special Traits
**Blight Monkey Mange Vulnerability:** [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] apes are especially susceptible to the mange carried by [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] monkeys. A [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] ape makes saving throws against the disease with tactical disadvantage. If a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] ape contracts [[Blight Monkey|Blight monkey]] mange, it loses great patches of its fur as the disease’s characteristic rash spreads across its body, eventually infiltrating the ape’s respiratory system. If a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] ape sustains ability damage in excess of an ability score as a result of the disease, it dies as it slowly suffocates due to its compromised airways and lungs.

## Actions
**Melee Attack—Slam:** +5 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d4 + 3` bludgeoning damage.

## Description
**Environment**: Urban (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary

It is speculated that [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] apes probably originated as some species of Libynosi ape transported en masse over the years to Castorhage to serve in assorted menageries of the well-to-do, circuses for the common folk, and as game animals in the hunting preserves of the truly decadent. Whatever type of ape they are descended from is unknown because no further specimens have been found in recent centuries, and they are presumed to be extinct in their natural habitat due to hunting as well as the wholesale capture and exportation of them. Over the years, their numbers proliferated in the city of Castorhage, and they took readily to the ways of their captors, literally aping their mannerisms and habits. At some point in the last century, bored nobles who had long ago taken to dressing them in finery in mockery of their near-human appearance realized that the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] apes were no longer simply mimicking their human masters, they were in fact carrying out their own activities in the same manner as the humans around them. They had evolved into an entirely new species, no longer truly animals.

With the realization of the evolution of the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] ape came the discovery that they were both intelligent (if not truly smart) but also of an extremely lawful and peaceful nature. Likewise, though they can understand the Common tongue well enough, they never developed the ability to use language of their own beyond a few simple grunts and hand motions. It soon became in vogue to keep the creatures as scullions and servants, which developed over time into actually hiring them into trusted positions as butlers and governesses with a known penchant for keeping their mouths shut about any internal secrets they might learn. By whim of Castorhage law, [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] apes receive the same wage as any other hireling in their position and are now often seen as actual family members by some of the more benevolent folk of the city. However, there are far more [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] apes than there are staff positions in well-to-do households, so most [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] apes find themselves relegated to menial jobs and poor treatment.

Most are actually employed by the city, since few businesses choose to hire a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] ape over a human or other humanoid race if they’re going to have to pay the same rate anyway, but there are some exceptions — particularly for jobs where a combination of extreme loyalty and extreme discretion are desirable.

[[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] apes despise [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] monkeys with a passion, and the little cretins are one of the few things that can truly rouse a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] ape to anger. Some of the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] apes hired by the city are actually armed for the purpose of hunting down and exterminating nests of [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] monkeys among the city rooftops, an occupation which they pursue with relish. For their part, [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] monkeys enjoy humiliating and even killing a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] ape whenever possible.
