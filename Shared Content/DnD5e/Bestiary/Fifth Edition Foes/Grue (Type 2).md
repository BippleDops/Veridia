## Special Traits
**Aura of Darkness:** A type 2 grue is permanently enveloped by a sphere of darkness with a 15-foot diameter. Other than the aura's size and duration, it behaves exactly as the darkness spell.

**Extinguish Light:** As a bonus action, a grue can extinguish one normal (nonmagical) light within 100 feet.

**Soul Devourer:** The body of any creature killed by a grue, along with everything it wore or carried, fades from existence `dice: 1d6` x 10 minutes after its death unless it is protected by magic such as a gentle repose spell. Four days later, the vanished person's soul returns as a grue, and it becomes impossible for the slain creature to ever be raised.

**Spell Immunity:** The only spells that affect a type 2 grue are those that do radiant damage.

## Description
Found in the darkest recesses of dungeons or in the deepest corners of attics, [[Grue (Type 1)|grues]] are the essence of Chaos and Darkness given form and a ravenous appetite for living souls.

Grues are chaotic spirits that exist in a blot of pure darkness. Unlike type 1 grues, a type 2 grue does not flee from a light source; it extinguishes it and then attacks the light wielder.

Because of the nature of their darkness aura, grues are effectively invisible to anyone without magical sight. All that anyone typically sees is the blot of darkness surrounding the entity. With magical senses such as truesight, a grue can be seen for what it is: a set of grinning, slavering jaws filled with multiple rows of pointed teeth, with no other physical presence at all.

On rare occasions, type 2 grues have been known to converse with adventurers rather than attacking them. They have shown remarkably deep knowledge about tremendously narrow topics, and they seem to have a great sense of pride in this. They are also cruel and malicious, zeroing in on someone’s fears and insecurities for use as conversational weapons. It’s possible that adventurers could actually learn something from a type 2 grue, if they can establish communication with it and discover the subject of its interest.
