## How The Market Moves Between Realms

### The Dimensional Anchoring System
The Floating Market exists in a carefully constructed pocket dimension that maintains physical contact points with both [[Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos]]. The market doesn't truly "move" in a conventional sense, but rather shifts its access points between the realms on a precisely timed schedule.

#### The Portal Network
- **Primary Gates**: Two major portals, one connecting to each realm's capital city
- **Secondary Access**: Smaller portals to important trading centers and diplomatic hubs
- **Emergency Exits**: Hidden escape routes for crisis evacuation
- **Temporal Synchronization**: All portals maintain consistent time flow
- **Reality Buffers**: Transition zones that adapt visitors to dimensional differences

#### Movement Schedule
**Morning Phase (6 hours)**: Primary access to [[Aethermoor]]
- Major portal opens to [[The Crystal Metropolis]]
- Secondary gates connect to [[Brightforge]] and [[The Academy of Resonance]]
- Aquabyssos access limited to diplomatic channels only

**Afternoon Phase (6 hours)**: Balanced Access
- Both realms have full portal access
- Peak trading hours with maximum merchant activity
- Cultural exchange programs most active
- Neutral diplomatic meetings scheduled

**Evening Phase (6 hours)**: Primary access to [[Aquabyssos]]

- Aethermoor access limited to essential services

**Night Phase (6 hours)**: Restricted Access
- Both realms limited to emergency and diplomatic access

- Time for cleaning, restocking, and administrative tasks
- Portal energy regeneration period

### Dimensional Mechanics
The market maintains its neutral status through a complex system of dimensional anchors powered by [[The Great Crystal-Shadow Engine]], a unique device that harmonizes the opposing energies of both realms.

#### The Crystal-Shadow Engine
- **Location**: Deep beneath the market in heavily secured facility
- **Operation**: Combines Aethermoor crystal technology with Aquabyssos shadow manipulation
