_Source: Princes of the Apocalypse_ If Vanifer is in the fire node while [[Imix Pota isn't, the tiefling can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Vanifer uses a lair action to cast one of her spells, up to 3rd level, without using components or a spell slot. She can't cast the same spell two rounds in a row, although she can continue to concentrate on a spell she previously cast using a lair action. Vanifer can take no other lair actions while [conditions#Concentration|concentrating]] on a spell cast as a lair action. Her favorite use of this capability is casting [[fireball-xphb (spells) or [Hypnotic Pattern Xphb]]. If Vanifer casts [[Misty Step Xphb using this lair action, she also draws the power of the fire node into herself. By doing so, she regains 15 (``dice: 3d8` + 2`) hit points. ## Player-Facing Summary Vanifer pota is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of vanifer pota as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around vanifer pota. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A letter reveals a conspiracy about the cult
