# High Priestess Scylla Deepdream

## Overview
Once a surface world oracle who foresaw the Great Drowning, Scylla chose to drown herself ritually to gain the power to shape it. Now barely recognizable as having been human, she leads the Wake faction in their mission to awaken Thal'mexis and drown the surface world completely. She speaks only in prophecies and views linear time as a quaint limitation.

- Voice echoes from past and future simultaneously

## Personality
- Experiences all moments of her existence simultaneously
- Shows compassion by offering "merciful drowning"
- Genuinely believes drowning is evolution, not death
- Speaks in riddles because linear thought is impossible
- Loves all beings but in an alien, consuming way

## DM Notes
Scylla represents the alien horror of Aquabyssos—someone who chose transformation and can't understand why others resist. Her temporal abilities make her nearly impossible to surprise or defeat conventionally. She should feel like a force of nature rather than a person, speaking in paradoxes and prophecies that come true in unexpected ways. Her genuine belief that she's saving the world through drowning makes her sympathetic yet terrifying.
