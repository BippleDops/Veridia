# Spiderhaunt Woods
Spiderhaunt Wood was a forest on the southwestern edge of Shadowdale in the Dalelands. The North Ride ran just south of the woods, and the Tethyamar Trail ran the whole eastern border of the wood. A single trail, the Arachnid Pathway, led from the Tethyamar Trail into the heart of the wood.

Spellcasters of all types came to the Spiderhaunt Woods to gather spider-related spell components.

### Inhabitants
The Spiderhaunt Wood was, of course, inhabited by spiders of all known types, as well as ettercaps and chitines.

### Locations

#### Lake Melishar
Lake Melishar was a clear, cool lake in the middle of the Spiderhaunt Wood.

##### Geography
**Flora & Fauna**
The lake was known to be teeming with fish and the surrounding area was full of small wildlife like deer, raccoons, and rabbits. Giant spiders were rarely seen here as they didn't like the light that shone in from the open area of the forest.

**Nature's Inn**
A small cabin on the lake's shore

**History**
This lake was named after an elven ranger that explored Spiderhaunt Wood in the 13th century, DR.
