--- > [!figure] View # Angels and Depths *A weathered tavern where sea chanties blend with the whispers of the deep* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview The **Angels and Depths** stands as one of [[Aquabyssos's most storied taverns, built into the carved remains of an ancient [Leviathan]] skeleton that washed ashore centuries ago. Located in the [[Port Quarter, this establishment serves as neutral ground for [Pirates]], [[Merfolk diplomats, and [Deep Sea Cultists]] alike. The massive ribcage forms the main dining hall, while smaller chambers carved from vertebrae serve as private booths and guest rooms. Indeed, ## Atmosphere & Description The tavern's interior is a marvel of nautical architecture. Bioluminescent coral growths provide ethereal blue-green lighting, while the polished bone walls are adorned with salvaged treasures from countless shipwrecks. The air carries the perpetual scent of sea salt, aged rum, and the mysterious depths. At high tide, seawater laps at the lower windows, creating an otherworldly ambiance as [[Abyssal Fish swim past the glass. The centerpiece is the **Kraken's Crown** - a massive chandelier crafted from crystallized tentacles that pulses with faint magical energy. Local legend claims it grants prophetic dreams to those who sleep beneath it, though the visions often come with a price. ### Cordelia "Dead-Eye" Marrows
