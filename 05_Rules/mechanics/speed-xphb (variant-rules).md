--- # Speed

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 374. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* A creature has a Speed, which is the distance in feet the creature can cover when it moves on its turn. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Special Speeds Some creatures have special speeds, such as a Burrow Speed, [[Climb Speed Xphb, [Fly Speed Xphb]], or [[swim-speed-xphb (variant-rules), each of which is defined in this glossary. If you have more than one speed, choose which one to use when you move; you can switch between the speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can't use the new speed during the current move. For example, if you have a Speed of 30 and a [Fly Speed Xphb]] of 40, you could fly 10 feet, walk 10 feet, and leap into the air to fly 20 feet more. ## Changes to Your Speeds If an effect increases or decreases your Speed for a time, any special speed you have increases or decreases by an equal amount for the same duration. For example, if your Speed is reduced to 0 and you have a [[Climb Speed Xphb, your [Climb Speed Xphb]] is also reduced to 0. Similarly, if your Speed is halved and you have a [[Fly Speed Xphb, your [Fly Speed Xphb]] is also halved. ## Player-Facing Summary Speed xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of speed xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around speed xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is blackmailing an heir for love
