**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (100-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (a pair of miniature bronze drums)

## Effects
This spell is used to rally or demoralize troops. You choose which effect you wish to use.

♦ ***Drums of Despair.*** The sound of oppressively loud war drums fills the area. All creatures within that area, except for allies you designate, must make a Wisdom saving throw. A creature who fails is filled with dread and despair and be at disadvantage on all saving throws for the duration. In addition, whenever an affected creature rolls a 20 when rolling to attack, that creature must reroll.

♦ ***Rousing Anthem.*** The sound of rhythmic, encouraging drums fills the area. All allies you designate are at advantage on all saving throws for the duration. In addition, whenever an affected creature rolls a 1 when rolling to attack, that creature may re-roll.
