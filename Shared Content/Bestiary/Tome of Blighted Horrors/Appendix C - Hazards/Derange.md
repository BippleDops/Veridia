# Derange
## Overview
```ad-warning
title: GM Directions
collapse: open
Derange is blamed for much of the unsavory behavior to be found in The [[Blight]], or at least folk find it convenient to believe it to be the source.

Derange is a condition brought on when the tiny earwig spider lays its egg in the ear of a sleeping victim. The warmth of the victim’s body causes the egg to hatch and the tiny earwig larva to burrow through the eardrum and inner ear into motor control centers in the victim’s brain. Once the larva has nested in this area, it creates a small cyst and begins to draw nourishment from the hormones and chemical interactions within while bathing these centers with chemicals of its own. The result is that the victim’s personality changes, his alignment randomly shifting each morning when he awakes (see table). The victim is still in control of his actions, but these actions reflect the priorities and methods subscribed to by this new alignment. At night, the victim often awakes in the midst of sleep with a return to his original alignment and a full and sickening awareness of the things he has been doing.

This condition can be removed with *lesser restoration* or comparable magic. Likewise, each morning upon awakening, the victim makes a DC 13 Wis saving to resist the alignment-altering effect and to function with normal alignment. After 1–3 weeks, the derange larva matures into an earwig spider and exits the victim to begin the next stage of its lifecycle. When this occurs, the victim must make a DC 8 Con saving throw. If it succeeds, the victim recovers fully (though there may be lasting repercussions from deeds done under different alignments; being under the influence of derange is not recognized as a legal defense before the Courts of Castorhage). If the saving throw fails, then the departing earwig spider ruptures an artery in the victim’s skull as it crawls out of the victim’s head; the victim bleeds to death internally in `dice: 2d4` rounds unless magical healing halts the bleeding before then.
