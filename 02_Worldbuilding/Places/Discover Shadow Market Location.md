# Discover Shadow Market Location

*"The market that exists only in whispers and shadows."*

## Overview
A covert investigation quest where players must locate the hidden Shadow Market - a black market operating in the depths of Aquabyssos. This underground network deals in forbidden artifacts, illegal memory trades, and contraband from the surface world.

Success requires careful information gathering, building trust with criminal contacts, and avoiding detection by city authorities who have been trying to shut down the market for years.

## Quest Objectives
- Gather three location clues from different sources
- Gain trust of at least one shadow merchant
- Locate the market's current meeting place
- Avoid detection by city watch
- Optional: Establish ongoing trade relationship

## Investigation Methods
**Information Gathering**: Interview dock workers, tavern patrons, and known criminals
**Following Leads**: Track suspicious shipments and midnight meetings
**Building Trust**: Complete small favors for underworld contacts
**Stealth Operations**: Shadow suspects to meeting locations

## Key NPCs
- **Whisper Tom**: Informant with partial knowledge
- **Captain Blackcurrent**: Smuggler with connections
- **The Broker**: Shadow market coordinator (identity unknown)

## Potential Locations
- Abandoned kelp farms in the outer districts
- Hidden chambers beneath the Harbor District
- Mobile meetings on modified submarines
- Secret caves in the Abyssal Trenches

## Rewards
- Access to rare black market goods
- 1,500 XP per character
- Criminal network connections
- Information about larger conspiracies

## Complications
- City watch investigation running parallel
- Rival criminal groups protecting territory
- Market location changes frequently
- Some contacts may be undercover agents

## Adventure Hooks
1. Player needs specific illegal item or service
2. Investigation into missing person leads here
3. Character's criminal contact offers information trade

## DM Notes
Emphasize the cat-and-mouse nature of the investigation. The market should feel dangerous and exclusive. Players should earn access through roleplay rather than combat.
