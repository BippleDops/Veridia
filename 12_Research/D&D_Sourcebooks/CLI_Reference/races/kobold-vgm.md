## Traits

### Age

Kobolds reach adulthood at age 6 and can live up to 120 years but rarely do so.

### Size

Kobolds are between 2 and 3 feet tall and weigh between 25 and 35 pounds. Your size is Small.

### Darkvision

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Grovel, Cower, and Beg

As an action on your turn, you can cower pathetically to distract nearby foes. Until the end of your next turn, your allies gain advantage on attack rolls against enemies within 10 feet of you that you can see. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

### Sunlight Sensitivity

You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.
