*Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 114, Elemental Evil Player's Companion p. 7, Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide p. 115* **Prerequisite**: [[Gnome Deep Mtf You have inherited the innate spellcasting ability of your ancestors. This ability allows you to cast [nondetection-xphb (spells)]] on yourself at will, without needing a material component. You can also cast each of the following spells once with this ability: [[blindness-deafness-xphb (spells), [blur-xphb (spells)]], and [[disguise-self-xphb (spells)]]. You regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you cast them at their lowest possible levels. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Svirfneblin magic mtf is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
