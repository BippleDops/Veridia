## Description
I really adore this collection of ornamental and decorative walking aids. We offer everything from a basic walking stick (3 sp), to a fully carved ash staff (8 gp), to silver and gold carved cane heads, some set with gemstones (prices vary). If you just want to go hiking, cut down a sapling, but if you prize fine craftsmanship, youâ€™ll want to get our entire collection. Yes, we will special order personalized cane handle requests.
