### Useful Dataview Queries

#### Track Transformation
```dataview
TABLE 
  corruption_exposure as "Crystal",
  ap_gained as "Adaptation",
  shadow_level_change as "Shadow"
FROM #session
WHERE campaign contains "Aethermoor" OR campaign contains "Aquabyssos"
```

#### NPC Relationship Web
```dataview
LIST
FROM #npc
WHERE contains(tags, "aquabyssos") OR contains(tags, "aethermoor")
SORT faction
```

#### Location Merger Status
```dataview
TABLE
  depth as "Depth",
  merge_status as "Status",
  stability as "Stability"
FROM #location
WHERE world = "Aquabyssos" OR world = "Aethermoor"
```

### Linking Best Practices
- Use aliases for NPCs with multiple names
- Tag sessions with both world names when merged
- Create merger notes linking parallel locations
- Track transformation in character notes
- Use Mermaid diagrams for faction relationships

## üé¨ Final Thoughts

The beauty of the Aquabyssos-Aethermoor connection lies in its flexibility. Whether your players save everyone, doom both worlds, or create something entirely new, the framework supports their choices while maintaining narrative coherence.

Remember: In the space between worlds, identity itself becomes fluid. Use this uncertainty to create memorable roleplaying moments and force difficult decisions that have no perfect answers.

The merger isn't just about two worlds colliding‚Äîit's about what it means to be human when humanity itself is negotiable.
