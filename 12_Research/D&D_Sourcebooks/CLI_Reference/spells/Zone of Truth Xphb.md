--- # Zone of Truth

*2nd-level, Enchantment* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minutes You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius [[Area of Effect Xphb]] centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there makes a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can't speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether a creature succeeds or fails on this save. An affected creature is aware of the spell and can avoid answering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive yet must be truthful. **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 343.
