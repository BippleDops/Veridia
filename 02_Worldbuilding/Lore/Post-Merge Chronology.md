# Post-Merge Chronology
*The Birth and Development of Aquabyssos (1 AE - Present)*

## Overview

Following the Great Convergence, the merged realm of Aquabyssos has undergone three distinct historical periods: the Adaptation Era (1-156 AE), the Expansion Era (157-445 AE), and the Modern Era (446 AE - Present, 1247 AE). This chronicle documents the evolution of a civilization born from catastrophe.

## Personal Accounts Through the Ages

### Early Adaptation Period
**Marina Saltwind, Age 23, Former Surface Dweller (12 AE)**
*"Today I celebrated my daughter's fifth birthday underwater. She was born here, in the depths, and she's never known a world where the sky wasn't full of ocean. When I watch her play with mer-folk children and talk to the crystal formations like they're old friends, I know we didn't lose our world in the Convergence. We found it."*

### Expansion Era  
**Captain Kael Windweaver III, Age 45, Dimensional Explorer (298 AE)**
*"Grandfather always told stories about the old Aethermoor, floating cities and wind magic. Today I visited seventeen different dimensions, each with their own impossible wonders. The convergence didn't trap us underwater - it opened infinite skies for us to explore."*

### Modern Era
**Deep Speaker Harmony Voidheart, Age Transcendent, Reality Gardener (1156 AE)**
*"I helped birth a new reality today. Watched the first sparks of consciousness develop in a dimension we've been cultivating for three centuries. The little awareness-seeds are so curious about existence. Soon they'll be ready for their own teachers. The Deep Mother was right - we didn't survive the catastrophe. We became the gardeners of possibility."*

## Player-Facing Summary

Post Merge Chronology is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Post Merge Chronology as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Post Merge Chronology.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Post Merge Chronology to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at Post Merge Chronology to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to Post Merge Chronology active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
