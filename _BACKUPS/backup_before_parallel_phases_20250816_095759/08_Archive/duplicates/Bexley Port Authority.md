**Location**: [[Bexley]] ## Description

The Bexley Port Authority is the law enforcement agency that is responsible for patrolling the waters around the city of Bexley. They are a well-trained and well-equipped force, and they are dedicated to keeping the peace. ## Player-Facing Summary Bexley Port Authority is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Bexley Port Authority as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Bexley Port Authority. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - An heirloom has gone missing and evil awakens
