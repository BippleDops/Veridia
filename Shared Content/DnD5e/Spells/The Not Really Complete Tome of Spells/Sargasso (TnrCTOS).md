# Sargasso (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 300 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a small amount of seaweed and live brine shrimp)

## Effects
You choose a point within range. The area within a 100 foot radius of that point becomes choked with seaweed, turning it into difficult terrain for both ships and swimmers for the duration of the spell.
