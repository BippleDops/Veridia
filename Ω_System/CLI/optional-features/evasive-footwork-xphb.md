# Evasive Footwork
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 95*  

As a [Bonus Action](/3-Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), you can expend one Superiority Die and take the [Disengage](/3-Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Disengage) action. You also roll the die and add the number rolled to your AC until the start of your next turn.
