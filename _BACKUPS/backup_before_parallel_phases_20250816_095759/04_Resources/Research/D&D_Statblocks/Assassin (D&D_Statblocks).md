Any hit she scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit. **Shadow Step.** As a bonus action, Vespara can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space she can see that is in dim light or darkness. **Sneak Attack.** Once per turn, Vespara deals an extra 21 (`dice: 6d6`) damage when she hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll. **Crystal Shard Poison.** Vespara's weapons are coated with crystallized shadow essence. Targets hit must make a **DC 16** Constitution saving throw or take 7 (`dice: 2d6`) necrotic damage and be poisoned for 1 minute. **Evasion.** When subjected to an effect that allows a Dex saving throw for half damage, Vespara takes no damage on success and half on failure. ## Actions **Multiattack.** Vespara makes two attacks with her Shadow Blade or throws two Crystal Shards. **Shadow Blade.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (`dice: 1d8` + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (`dice: 2d6`) necrotic damage. **Crystal Shard.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (`dice: 1d6` + 5) piercing damage plus poison effect. **Infiltrate (3/Day).** Vespara casts *pass without trace* or *invisibility* (self only). ## Description Vespara Thorne is a legendary assassin who walks the razor's edge between Aethermoor and Aquabyssos. Once a noble's daughter from the Crystal Spires, she was touched by shadow corruption during a diplomatic mission to the depths. Rather than succumb to madness, she embraced the darkness and became something newâ€”a killer who moves between worlds like a whisper in the night. Standing 5'6" with platinum hair streaked with shadow-black, Vespara's most striking feature is her heterochromic eyes: one crystal-blue (Aethermoor heritage), one void-black (shadow corruption). Intricate tattoos of crystalline patterns spiral down her arms, pulsing faintly with trapped shadows. She operates from the Shadowblade District, a neutral zone where information flows like water and contracts are sealed in blood and crystal dust. Her reputation is built on three pillars: she never misses a target, she never breaks a contract, and she never kills without cause. ## Relationships **Allies:**

- **[[The Biomancers** - Has an uneasy alliance; they occasionally hire her services and she provides them with rare shadow-touched specimens
- **Master Keth** - Her former mentor in the Shadowblade Guild (presumed dead)
- **Whisper Network** - Information brokers throughout both realms **Enemies:**
- **[Parliament Loyalists]]** - They've placed a massive bounty on her head for assassinating Lord Crystalborn
- **The Purification Order** - Zealots who see her shadow corruption as an abomination
- **House Thorne** - Her own family disowned her after her transformation **Complicated:**
- **Captain Aldric Shadowmend** - Former lover turned political rival
- **The Shadow Courts** - She owes them a debt that grows heavier each day ## Quest Hooks 1. **The Crystal Heart Contract** - Vespara has been hired to steal the Heart of Aethermoor, but the job feels wrong. She needs the party's help to uncover who's really behind the contract. 2. **Shadow Debt** - The Shadow Courts are calling in Vespara's debt. She must complete three impossible tasks or forfeit her soul. She reluctantly seeks allies. 3. **Family Reunion** - House Thorne is hosting a grand ball, and Vespara has received an invitation written in her mother's hand. It's obviously a trap, but she can't resist going. 4. **The Biomancer's Gambit** - [[The Biomancers]] have offered Vespara a cure for her shadow corruption, but the price is assassinating someone she's sworn to protect. 5. **Mentor's Legacy** - Master Keth has been spotted alive in the deepest trenches of Aquabyssos, but he's no longer entirely human. Vespara needs a team to help her reach him. ## Roleplaying Notes **Personality**: Cool, calculated, but surprisingly moral. Speaks in measured tones with occasional flashes of dry humor. **Ideals**: "Death should have meaning. I am the sword that cuts away corruption, even if I must be corrupted to wield it." **Bonds**: "My brother's death will be avenged, no matter the cost to my soul." **Flaws**: "I trust no one completely, not even those who've earned it. Everyone has a price, everyone has a secret, everyone will betray you eventually." **Voice**: Speaks Common with an upper-class accent that she occasionally slips back into. Uses Aquabyssan curse words when frustrated. ## Player-Facing Summary Assassin is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Assassin as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Assassin. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
