# Challenge Rating
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 363. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

Challenge Rating (CR) summarizes the threat a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/monster-xphb|monster]] poses to a group of four [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/player-character-xphb|player characters]]. Compare a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/monster-xphb|monster's]] CR to the characters' level. If the CR is higher, the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/monster-xphb|monster]] is likely a danger. If the CR is lower, the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/monster-xphb|monster]] likely poses little threat. But circumstances and the number of [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/player-character-xphb|player characters]] can significantly alter how threatening a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/monster-xphb|monster]] is in actual play. The "Dungeon Master's Guide" provides guidance to the DM on using CR while planning potential combat [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/encounter-xphb|encounters]].
