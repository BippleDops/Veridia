--- # Legal System of Aquabyssos *The comprehensive judicial framework that governs life in the drowned world* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview The Legal System of Aquabyssos represents a unique fusion of ancient Tethyan maritime law, post-Drowning emergency protocols, and modern adaptations to underwater life. This complex judicial framework must address challenges unknown to surface civilizations: three-dimensional territory disputes, pressure-based crimes, magical pollution, and the intersection of multiple sapient species with vastly different legal traditions. The system emphasizes rehabilitation over punishment, recognizing that in the confined environment of underwater cities, social harmony is essential for survival. ### Pre-Drowning Legal Heritage

**Tethyan Maritime Code (1,823-1 BGD)**

The foundation of Aquabyssos law lies in the **Tethyan Maritime Code**, a comprehensive legal system developed by the ancient Tethyan Hegemony to govern their vast oceanic empire. This code emphasized:
- **Collective Responsibility**: Communities shared accountability for individual crimes
- **Restorative Justice**: Focus on repairing harm rather than punishment
- **Adaptive Precedent**: Laws that could evolve based on changing circumstances
- **Environmental Protection**: Strong regulations protecting oceanic ecosystems
- **Multi-Species Accommodation**: Legal frameworks for diverse sapient beings ### The Emergency Codex (1-47 AGD)

**Crisis Legislation**

In the immediate aftermath of the Great Drowning, survival took precedence over traditional jurisprudence. The **Emergency Codex** established temporary laws focused on:
