## Description
Longhorns produce perhaps the purest, most lyric tones of any instruments. Their simple elegance, playability, and portability have made them rival the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items (WOTC)/Yarting|yarting]] in popularity. The treble variety (15 gp) creates very high and piercing tones, like those of birds chirping. The common longhorn covers the mid to upper tones and comes in brass (15 gp), silver (35 gp), wood (10 gp), and bamboo (15 gp). Tenor longhorns are available only by special order.
