# Mind Lash

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Melee Weapon, Whip

**Rarity:** rare

**Attunement**: *requires attunement* by a mind flayer

**Weight**: 3 lbs.

**Damage:** 1d4 slashing

## Description

In the hands of any creature other than a [[mind flayer]], a mind lash functions as a normal whip. In the hands of an illithid, this magic weapon strips away a creature's will to survive as it also strips away flesh, dealing an extra `dice: 2d4` psychic damage to any target it hits. Any creature that takes psychic damage from the mind lash must also succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
