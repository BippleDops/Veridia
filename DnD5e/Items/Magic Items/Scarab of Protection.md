## Description
If you hold this beetle-shaped medallion in your hand for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface revealing its magical nature. It provides two benefits while it is on your person:
- You have [[2 - Advantage and Disadvantage|advantage]] on [[6 - Saving Throws|saving throws]] against spells.
- The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a [[Necromancy|necromancy]] spell or a harmful effect originating from an [[14 - Monsters|undead]] creature, you can use your [[12 - The Order of Combat|reaction]] to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.
