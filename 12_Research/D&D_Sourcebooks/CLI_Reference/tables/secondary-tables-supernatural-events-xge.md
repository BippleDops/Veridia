| 1-5 | You were ensorcelled by a fey and enslaved for `d6` years before you escaped. |
| 6-10 | You saw a demon and ran away before it could do anything to you. |

| 51-60 | You witnessed a minor miracle. |
| 61-70 | You explored an empty house and found it to be haunted. |

| 76-80 | You saw a ghost. |
| 81-85 | You saw a ghoul feeding on a corpse. |
