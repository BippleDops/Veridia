## Overview
Duke Cyrus Reefheart leads the [[Coral Courts]] from [[Lumengarde]], championing biological adaptation as the future of [[Aquabyssos World Overview]]. His body is a living artwork of symbiotic modification - coral grows from his shoulders, bioluminescent patterns pulse beneath his translucent skin, and small fish swim through hollow chambers in his torso. What remains human is beautiful in an alien way, but less of him is human each year.

## History
Born to ancient noble family that ruled the Coral Islands before drowning. Family was first to accept biological adaptation to survive. Cyrus took the process further than anyone, allowing complete symbiosis with coral palace. Has ruled Lumengarde for 89 years but appears ageless due to constant regeneration.

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Voice**: Soft and measured

**Speech Pattern**: Casual and relaxed

**Physical Habits**: Paces while speaking

## Current Activities
1. Merging further with his palace-body
2. Developing adaptation to resist [[The Deepmind]]
3. Negotiating trade disputes with [[Pressure's End]]
4. Spreading biological adaptation philosophy
5. Growing a "daughter" from his own biomass

## Secrets
> [!warning] DM Only
> - No longer has a human brain - consciousness distributed through colony
> - The Coral Courts are actually one super-organism he controls
> - Can infect others with symbiotic organisms through touch
> - Growing an army of bio-weapons in secret
> - Plans to forcibly adapt all of Aquabyssos "for their own good"

## Transformation Stages

3. **Year 31-60**: Hollow chambers, symbiotic organs
4. **Year 61-89**: Current state - more colony than man
