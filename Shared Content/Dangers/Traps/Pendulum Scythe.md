# Pendulum Scythe
## Overview
*Mechanical trap*
A large scythe drops from the ceiling and swings back and forth in a line 5 feet wide and 20 feet long when a hidden pressure plate in the room is pressed. Any weight of more than 20 pounds placed on the pressure plate triggers the trap. The pressure plate can be spotted with a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. A character studying the area can determine the pressure plate is a slightly different color than the rest of the floor with a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check and that the ceiling holds the outline of a trapdoor (from which the trap's blade springs forth) with a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating and attempting to open the compartment in the ceiling results in the trap activating.

Once the trap is triggered it acts at the start of every round. The scythe makes an attack roll against creatures in its path with a +7 bonus to attack. On a hit the attack deals 33 (6d10) slashing damage.

Some pressure plates are triggered to activate multiple pendulum scythes in a room or hall each of which runs along a different line and gets to make its own attacks at the start of the round.
