*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 23. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* Awakened shrubs can be any sort of small plant, from forest bushes to clustered flowers. They often appear near awakened trees or in regions imbued with primal magic. Some have whimsical appearances or foliage resembling rudimentary facial features, while others look like animate topiary creatures. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Awakened Plants *Vegetation Given Magical Life* - **Habitat.** Forest - **Treasure.** None Magic can invest plants with mobility, sapience, and even a voice. Spells such as [Awaken Xphb]] or the influence of other planes of existence might bring mundane vegetation to life, while other remarkable plants might naturally have these features. > [!quote] A quote from Rivergleam, Pixie > > Just because we protect the forest doesn't mean it's defenseless.```statblock
