## Description
Wizards and priests quickly tire of digging through a pile of crumpled scrolls at the bottom of a backpack, hurriedly trying to find the right scroll while the party’s getting eaten. To solve that problem, we have created a special scrollcase, made of fine-tooled leather, that organizes your scrolls with quick ease. The entire device is a long strip of leather, wide enough for most standard size scrolls, in which a series of pockets have been sewn, overlapping down the line. Any scroll can be slipped into one of the pockets, with only the top edge of the parchment page showing, revealing the title of that scroll. With a whole series of scrolls in place, your entire collection is easily indexed for quick perusal, yet quite safe in individual pockets. The whole case unrolls to about two feet, holding up to fifteen scrolls. When you’re ready to travel, the case rolls up into a nice, sturdy tube that clips shut, with a special pouch at the end that seals the whole up tight, protecting your precious scrolls against the elements. Our unique scrollcase sells for only 5 gp.
