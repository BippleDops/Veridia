# Goldwave Manor
## The Crown Jewel of Merchant Nobility

> *"Gold flows like water through these halls, and water shimmers like gold in the light of our success. Here, where crystal meets current, the future of two realms is bought and sold with the elegance befitting true nobility."*
> — [02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Aurelius Goldwave]], Master of the House

## Overview

Goldwave Manor stands as the most magnificent private residence in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian - Market Square, serving simultaneously as luxurious family estate, sophisticated financial headquarters, and exclusive social center for [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s mercantile elite. Built by the legendary Goldwave Trading Empire over three generations, this architectural marvel demonstrates how vast wealth can be transformed into lasting power and influence.

Unlike traditional noble houses that derive their status from bloodlines and land holdings, the Goldwave family has created their aristocracy through commercial genius and financial innovation. Their manor reflects this unique position, combining the grandeur expected of high nobility with cutting-edge magical technology and practical business facilities that manage a trading empire spanning multiple realms.

The estate occupies a prime location overlooking both [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian Harbor and the city's central financial district, strategically positioned to monitor commercial activity while displaying the family's prosperity. The manor's distinctive architecture, featuring walls that literally flow with liquid gold suspended in crystal matrices, has become an iconic symbol of merchant power and sophisticated wealth.

Beyond its role as private residence, Goldwave Manor functions as an exclusive financial institution, diplomatic center, and social hub where the most important commercial and political decisions affecting [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s economy are negotiated over elegant dinners and in opulent private chambers.
