# Wakened Scaled Ornament

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** very rare

**Attunement**: *requires attunement*

## Description

This ornament can be jewelry, a cloak, or another wearable accessory. It appears to be fashioned from a dragon's scale, tooth, or claw, or it incorporates images in those shapes.

You gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can't be [[charmed]] or [[frightened]]. Moreover, each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you has advantage on saving throws it makes to avoid being [[charmed} or [[frightened]] or to end those conditions on itself.

When you would take damage of the type dealt by the breath of the dragon in whose hoard the ornament became Wakened, you can use your reaction to take no damage instead, and you regain hit points equal to the damage you would have taken. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
