# Flying
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 367. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A variety of effects allow a creature to fly. While flying, you fall if you have the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] or [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Prone|Prone]] condition or your [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/fly-speed-xphb|Fly Speed]] is reduced to 0. You can stay aloft in those circumstances if you can hover.

Flying xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of flying xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around flying xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
