# Giant Insect
*4th-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You summon a giant centipede, spider, or wasp (chosen when you cast the spell). It manifests in an unoccupied space you can see within range and uses the [[giant-insect-xphb|Giant Insect]] stat block. The form you choose determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your [[initiative-xphb|Initiative]] count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [[actions#Dodge|Dodge]] action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.

**Classes**: [[list-spells-classes-druid|Druid]]; [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]
