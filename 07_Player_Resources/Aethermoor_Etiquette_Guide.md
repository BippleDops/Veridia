# Aethermoor Etiquette Guide

*Navigate the treacherous skies of social propriety*

## Overview

In Aethermoor, where crystal spires pierce clouds and nobility float above common concerns, proper etiquette can mean the difference between advancement and exile, between alliance and war. The sky realm's complex social hierarchies, influenced by altitude, crystal corruption, and ancient traditions, create a labyrinth of protocols that even natives sometimes struggle to navigate.

This guide provides essential knowledge for surviving—and thriving—in Aethermoor's social situations, from casual market interactions to formal court presentations.

## The Hierarchy of Heights

### Altitude-Based Status

In Aethermoor, physical elevation directly correlates to social standing:

| Altitude | Social Class | Forms of Address | Behavioral Expectations |
|----------|--------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Sky Palaces** (10,000ft+) | Royalty | "Your Radiance" | Never speak unless spoken to |
| **High Spires** (7,000-10,000ft) | High Nobility | "Your Grace" | Bow deeply, avert eyes |
| **Noble Quarters** (5,000-7,000ft) | Lesser Nobility | "Lord/Lady" | Bow, may make eye contact |
| **Merchant Clouds** (3,000-5,000ft) | Wealthy Merchants | "Master/Mistress" | Nod respectfully |
| **Common Platforms** (1,000-3,000ft) | Commoners | By name | Casual interaction |
| **Ground Level** (0-1,000ft) | Servants/Outcasts | No formal address | Often ignored |

### The Cardinal Rule
**Never physically position yourself above someone of higher social rank.** This means:
- Sitting while they stand is insulting
- Flying above them is aggressive
- Building higher is revolutionary
- Looking down on them is treasonous

## Greetings and Introductions

### Formal Greetings by Class

#### To Royalty
1. Drop to one knee (never both—that's for deities)
2. Right hand over heart, left behind back
3. Say: "This humble servant greets Your Radiance, may your light never dim"
4. Remain kneeling until acknowledged
5. Rise only when explicitly permitted

#### To Nobility
1. Bow from waist (45° for High, 30° for Lesser)
2. Hands clasped in front
3. Say: "Your Grace/Lord/Lady [Name], I am honored by your presence"
4. Wait for acknowledgment before speaking further

#### To Equals
1. Slight bow (15°) or nod
2. Right hand extended palm up (showing no weapon)
3. Say: "Well met in clear skies, [Name/Title]"
4. Handshake only if offered

#### To Lower Classes
- Nobility to merchants: Slight nod if feeling generous
- Merchants to commoners: Brief acknowledgment
- Anyone to servants: Usually no greeting required

### Introduction Protocols

**The Rule of Three**: When introducing yourself, provide:
1. Your name
2. Your affiliation (family/guild/faction)
3. Your purpose

Example: "I am Marcus Windwright, of the Merchant Guild's Third Circle, seeking audience regarding the crystal trade."

**Order of Introduction**:
- Highest rank introduces themselves last
- Oldest before youngest (among equals)
- Locals before visitors
- Men before women (traditional) or women before men (progressive courts)

## Court Behavior

### Entering the Court

1. **Announcement**: Wait to be announced by the Herald
2. **Approach**: Walk (never run) directly to designated position
3. **The Three Steps**: Stop three steps from the throne/seat
4. **Acknowledgment**: Perform appropriate greeting
5. **Permission**: Wait for permission to speak

### Speaking in Court

#### The Five Nevers
1. Never interrupt royalty
2. Never turn your back on the throne
3. Never speak out of turn
4. Never show strong emotion
5. Never touch royalty unless saving their life

#### Proper Address Forms
- **To the Crown**: "If it pleases Your Radiance..."
- **To the Court**: "Noble lords and ladies..."
- **Making a Request**: "I humbly petition..."
- **Disagreeing**: "Perhaps Your Grace might consider..."
- **Accepting**: "You honor me beyond measure"
- **Declining**: "I fear I am unworthy of such honor"

### Court Positions

Where you stand matters:
- **Right of throne**: Highest honor
- **Left of throne**: Trusted advisor
- **Before throne**: Petitioner/accused
- **Sides of hall**: According to rank
- **Back of hall**: Observers only
- **Doorway**: Not yet permitted entry

## Dining Etiquette

### Sky Wine Ceremony

The traditional Aethermoor wine service:
1. **Presentation**: Sommelier shows label to host

3. **Tasting**: Host's cup first, small sip
4. **Serving**: Clockwise from host's right
5. **The Float**: Wine glasses literally float at proper height

## Gift Giving

### Appropriate Gifts by Occasion

| **Birthday** | Personal item | Crystals (implies corruption) |
| **Wedding** | Paired items | Singular items |

1. Use both hands
2. Bow while offering
3. State: "A humble token of [sentiment]"
4. If refused once, insist gently
5. If refused twice, withdraw gracefully
6. If refused thrice, you've given offense

## Crystal Corruption Etiquette

### Discussing Corruption

**Polite Terms**:
- "Blessed by crystal" (not "infected")

### Social Interactions
- Mild corruption (< 25%): Ignore politely
- Moderate (25-50%): May compliment if artistic
- Severe (50-75%): Offer assistance if appropriate
- Terminal (> 75%): Treat as nobility (they're beyond mortal concerns)

## Business Etiquette

5. **Presentation**: State terms clearly but softly
6. **Negotiation**: Three counter-offers maximum

## Dueling Etiquette
