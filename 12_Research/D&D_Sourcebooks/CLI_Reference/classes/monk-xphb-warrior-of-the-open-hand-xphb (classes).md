They learn techniques to push and trip their opponents and manipulate their own energy to protect themselves from harm. ### Open Hand Technique (Level 3) Whenever you hit a creature with an attack granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target. #### Addle The target can't make [[actions#Opportunity%20Attack|Opportunity Attacks]] until the start of its next turn. #### Push The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 15 feet away from you. #### Topple The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the [[conditions#prone|Prone]] condition. ### Wholeness of Body (Level 6) You gain the ability to heal yourself. As a [[Action Xphb]], you can roll your Martial Arts die. You regain a number of [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] equal to the number rolled plus your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] regained). You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long-rest-xphb]]. ### Fleet Step (Level 11) When you take a [[Action Xphb]] other than Step of the Wind, you can also use Step of the Wind immediately after that [[Action Xphb]]. ### Quivering Palm (Level 17) You gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's body. When you hit a creature with an [[Unarmed Strike Xphb]], you can expend 4 Focus Points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which last for a number of days equal to your Monk level. The vibrations are harmless unless you take an action to end them. Alternatively, when you take the [[actions#Attack|Attack]] action on your turn, you can forgo one of the attacks to end the vibrations. To end them, you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you end them, the target must make a Constitution saving throw, taking`10d12`Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a time. You can end the vibrations harmlessly (no action required). ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Monk xphb warrior of the open hand xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
