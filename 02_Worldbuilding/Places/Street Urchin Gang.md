# Street Urchin Gang

*"Small hands, quick minds, and nothing left to lose."*

## Overview
A resourceful band of homeless children and teenagers who survive on the streets of Aquabyssos through theft, information trading, and minor criminal activities. Led by streetwise youth, they operate in the city's forgotten corners and abandoned structures.
