The party witnesses a crystallized corpse being pulled from [[Port Meridian's harbor, releasing a pulse of violet energy that threatens everyone nearby. As they investigate the crystal plague's origins, they uncover disturbing connections between missing naval personnel, smuggling operations, and mysterious nightmares shared by all victims. ### [Opening Scene]]

**Location:** [[Pier 7
**Time:** Mid-morning, low tide
**Description:** The party arrives at the harbor as dock workers use hooks to pull something from the water. It's a crystallized corpse - a sailor whose body has transformed into purple crystal. As the workers lift it onto the pier, the corpse suddenly shatters with a sound like breaking glass. A pulse of violet energy erupts outward. **Mechanical:** Everyone within 10 feet makes **DC 12** Constitution save or gains 1 level of crystal exposure. #### Event 1: [The Shattered]] [[Sailor Investigation

**NPCs:** [[[Brother Marcus Steelbane]], plague victims
**Outcome:**
- Witness overwhelmed medical facilities

**NPCs:** [[Crystal Cult Initiates (4)
**Outcome:**

**Location:** Party's lodgings
**Cliffhanger:** Investigation reveals all clues point to the abandoned [[Lighthouse_of_Storms|Lighthouse of Storms on [[[Whisper Island]]]]. As night falls, a pillar of violet light erupts from the lighthouse, visible across the entire harbor. The light pulses three times, and every plague victim in the city screams simultaneously. ### Combat
