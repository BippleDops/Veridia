--- # The Tide Rises *Missing nobles, diplomatic immunity, and a conspiracy that threatens to drown Aethermoor* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Quest Overview

Several lesser nobles from [[Crystalhaven|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven have vanished after attending "cultural exchange" events at [The Drowned Embassy|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Drowned Embassy]]. [[Captain Lyanna Brightshield|02 Worldbuilding/People/Captain Lyanna Brightshield suspects foul play but cannot legally investigate due to diplomatic immunity. The party must uncover the truth while navigating international incidents and discovering a threat greater than anyone imagined. ## Quest Giver

**[Captain Lyanna Brightshield|02 Worldbuilding/People/Captain Lyanna Brightshield]]** approaches the party unofficially, as official channels are blocked by diplomatic protocols. ## Background

Three nobles - Lord Aldric Wavecrest, Lady Marea Shelworth, and Sir Donnel Clearwater - attended Embassy events over the past two months and haven't been seen since. [[Ambassador Korvin Blacktide|02 Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Korvin Blacktide claims they left safely, but their families report strange dreams of drowning and whispered words in unknown languages. ### Primary Objectives

1. Investigate the disappearances without violating diplomatic immunity
2. Discover the fate of the missing nobles
3. Uncover the true purpose of [The Drowned Embassy|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Drowned Embassy]]
4. Decide whether to expose, stop, or ally with the conspiracy ### The Noble's Fate

The nobles are alive but being transformed into Deep Heralds in the Embassy's flooded cells. They're nearly complete - in 3 days, they'll be sent back as sleeper agents. ### The Blackmail Web

[[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde|02 Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde knew about the kidnappings but is being blackmailed by Korvin, who has evidence of her corruption. She's been providing him with information about crystal defenses. ### The Greater Threat

The missing nobles are part of a ritual to open the Deep Gate. Their bloodlines are tied to ancient pacts that seal the boundary between realms. Once transformed, their corrupted blood will break these seals. ### The Goldspire Connection

[Zephyr Goldwhisper|02 Worldbuilding/People/Zephyr Goldwhisper]] and the Confederacy know about the threat and are prepared to use their Bombs to destroy the entire Embassy district if necessary, casualties included. ## DM Secrets

> [!warning] Timeline Pressure

> - Day 1-2: Investigation phase, gathering clues
> - Day 3: Transformation completes if not stopped
> - Day 4: Sleeper agents activated or Deep Gate ritual begins
> - Day 5: Either invasion begins or Goldspire implements scorched earth > [!danger] The Moral Dilemma
> The nobles can be saved, but they've already been partially transformed. Saving them means they'll carry Aquabyssos corruption forever, potentially spreading it. Killing them prevents the invasion but murders innocents. Letting them transform might be the only way to learn Aquabyssos's true plans. > [!info] Hidden Ally
> Tidecaller Nerissa, Korvin's attaché, is having doubts about the plan. She was once from Aethermoor and still has family in [[Port Meridian|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]]. She can be turned with the right approach. ## Player-Facing Summary The Tide Rises is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Tide Rises as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Tide Rises. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A letter reveals a conspiracy about a local noble
