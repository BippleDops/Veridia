%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 90* The astral brig is the standard githyanki military vessel. It requires a crew of five and can transport up to sixty passengers. A brig is 90 feet long and 30 feet wide, with two levels below decks for quarters and storage space. It is equipped with two ballistae, each one operated by a pair of crew members, and has a top speed of 12 miles per hour.```ad-statblock
