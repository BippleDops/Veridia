## Overview

Before the establishment of the [Parliament of Echoes]], [[Aquabyssos was ruled by a series of monarchs whose reigns spanned from the pre-drowning era through the tumultuous centuries following [The Great Drowning|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Drowning]]. These rulers, known collectively as the Drowned Dynasties, shaped the underwater civilization through periods of survival, adaptation, expansion, and eventually, the transition to democratic goverce.
