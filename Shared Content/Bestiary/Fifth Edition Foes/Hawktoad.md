## Special Traits
**Strangling:** When a hawktoad hits a target with its tongue, the monster wraps its tongue around the victim's neck. It then quickly maneuvers itself behind the target, landing on the target's back. The hawktoad digs in its claws and tries to strangle the victim with its tongue. If the targeted creature makes a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, it gets an arm, a hand, or some other limb or object under the hawktoad's tongue and avoids any further danger from this specific tongue attack; the hawktoad can try again on coming turns. If the Dexterity saving throw fails, the creature is being strangled by the hawktoad; it runs out of breath and begins suffocating. As long as the hawktoad continues strangling it, the unconscious creature can't stabilize by making successful death saving throws. If the hawktoad is killed or its stranglehold is broken, the victim can recover normally. A creature has tactical disadvantage on attacks against a hawktoad that has grappled it and is clinging to its back. A hawktoad uses its Dex in contests to maintain its grapple, instead of Str.

## Actions

**Claws:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (`dice: 1d4+2`) slashing damage.

**Tongue:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: the target is grappled and strangled (see above).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate and warm forest and swamp

**Organization**: Army (2–12)

## Description
Hawktoads are amphibians with the body of a very large toad, but their front paws have very long, hooked claws. Instead of back legs, they have a thick tail like that of a tadpole. The full length of a hawktoad is about 3 feet.

These bizarre creatures float in air and “swim” through it by lashing their tails, exactly the way a tadpole swims through water. Their sharp claws are dangerous, but the real threat comes from their tongues, with which they can strangle creatures up to Large size. Once a hawktoad gets its tongue around a potential victim’s neck and latches onto the victim’s back, it quickly transitions from pest to lethal threat.

A single hawktoad would be easy to deal with, but they always move and attack in packs. Hawktoads are most dangerous in spring, when they can be ravenous if the winter was particularly long or harsh.

There are rumors that some wizards have attained hawktoads as familiars, but most scholars discount them as legend. Even if such stories were true, the hawktoad’s foul temper would make it an unpleasant companion.
