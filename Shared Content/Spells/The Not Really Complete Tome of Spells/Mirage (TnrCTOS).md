# Mirage (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *illusion*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (seven drops of water)

**Duration**: 6 hours


## Effects
You create an elusive mirage on the horizon that beckons convincingly but never gets any closer. It occupies no more than a 45Â° arc, vertically or horizontally, and always appears fuzzy and indistinct.

All creatures who are capable of seeing it when you cast the spell must make a Wisdom saving throw; if they fail, they see the mirage. The creatures do not need to be facing the mirage; a creature that is facing away will still see a flicker in the corner of its eye.

If the mirage depicts something very de-sirable, anyone failing the first saving throw must make a second one or feel compelled to head towards the vision for the duration of the spell. Creatures who are immune to be-ing charmed cannot be affected by this spell.
