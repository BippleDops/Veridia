# Banishing Arrow
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 29*  

You use abjuration magic to try to temporarily banish your target to a harmless location in the Feywild. The creature hit by the arrow must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished in this way, the target's speed is 0, and it is [[conditions#Incapacitated|incapacitated]]. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it vacated or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

After you reach 18th level in this class, a target also takes `2d6` force damage when the arrow hits it.
