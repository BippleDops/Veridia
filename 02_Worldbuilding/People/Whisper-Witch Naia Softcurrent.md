# Whisper-Witch Naia Softcurrent

*She who trades in secrets and speaks in currents*

> [!figure] Portrait
> ![NPC Portrait](04_Resources/Assets/Generated/Portraits/whisper-witch-naia-softcurrent.png)

## Overview

Naia Softcurrent is one of the most enigmatic figures in Aquabyssos's underworld of information trading. Operating from a hidden grotto in the Depth Markets, she deals exclusively in secrets, prophecies, and forbidden knowledge. Her unique ability to "hear" the whispers carried by ocean currents makes her invaluable to those seeking hidden truths, though her prices are never measured in mere gold.

What sets Naia apart from other information brokers is her connection to the Whispering Way, an ancient network of mystics who claim to interpret the ocean's own memories. Whether she's genuinely psychic or simply exceptionally well-informed remains a mystery that even her closest associates cannot solve.

## Appearance

### Physical Description
- **Race**: Sea Elf (Depth-Adapted)
- **Age**: Appears 40, actually over 200
- **Height**: 5'8", elongated by water adaptation
- **Build**: Ethereally thin, almost translucent
- **Distinguishing Features**: Bioluminescent tattoos that pulse with her heartbeat, gills behind her ears, webbed fingers with extra joints
- **Typical Attire**: Flowing robes made from woven kelp that seem to move independently, adorned with small shells that chime softly

### Mannerisms
- **Voice**: Speaks in whispers that somehow carry perfectly through water, never raises her voice
- **Gestures**: Traces patterns in the water that leave brief glowing trails
- **Quirks**: Never makes direct eye contact, always listening to something others can't hear

## For the Table

### First Meeting (Read Aloud)
> *In a grotto lit only by bioluminescent algae, you find her floating in lotus position, eyes closed, surrounded by slowly orbiting spheres of water. Her kelp robes undulate without any current, and the tattoos on her visible skin pulse in patterns that hurt to follow. As you approach, she speaks without opening her eyes: "The currents told me you would come. They also told me what you seek... but not yet what you're willing to sacrifice for it."*

### Quick Roleplay Guide
- **Motivation**: To maintain the balance of information flow in Aquabyssos
- **Personality**: Cryptic, patient, unsettlingly perceptive
- **Speaking Style**: Whispers, speaks in metaphors about currents and tides
- **Topics They'll Discuss**: Secrets, prophecies, the nature of truth, prices
- **Topics They'll Avoid**: Her past, the Whispering Way's true nature, her sources

### The Three Things
1. **Secret**: She's slowly losing her physical form, becoming one with the ocean itself
2. **Desire**: To prevent the catastrophic merger of realms she's foreseen
3. **Fear**: That speaking certain truths aloud will make them real

### Interaction Outcomes
- **If PCs befriend**: Provides cryptic warnings about future dangers
- **If PCs antagonize**: Their secrets start spreading through the underworld
- **If PCs ignore**: Critical information reaches their enemies first
- **If PCs kill**: The Whispering Way marks them as enemies, information network turns hostile

## DM Notes

### Running This NPC
- **Core Concept**: Information has a price, but it's never what you expect
- **Key Decisions**: What secrets to reveal, what prices to demand
- **Flexibility**: Adjust her knowledge based on campaign needs

### Secrets Within Secrets
She's actually three entities sharing one body: past, present, and future versions of herself, which is why she knows so much but speaks in riddles.

### Alternative Interpretations
- Make her genuinely benevolent but cursed to speak in riddles
- She's a fragment of an abolished consciousness
- She's actually multiple people sharing an identity

### Voice Notes
Whisper everything. Pause mid-sentence as if listening. End statements with questions. "The tide rises, doesn't it?" Use water metaphors constantly.
