## Description
Stygian skeletons were first encountered in Rappan Athuk (see the adventure, Rappan Athuk from Necromancer Games and Frog God Games). Much more powerful than standard skeletons, these minions of evil are often employed as guardians over ancient knowledge that is best left undiscovered. They are intelligent, free-willed monsters, unlike zombies and lesser skeletons. They are known to sometimes act against the commands of those they serve, if doing so benefits the Stygian skeleton, preserves its existence, or furthers its mission.

Stygian skeletons are the remnants of creatures that were slain in an area saturated with evil. The bodies of fallen heroes become contaminated and polluted by the ambient evil and, within days after their death, rise as Stygian skeletons, leaving their former lives and bodies behind. Stygian skeletons maintain some memories of their former lives, but the retention is random and the skeletons themselves are often not aware of the memories’ significance (undead, as a group, are not known for deep introspection) until an event or a person reminds them.

Stygian skeletons wear whatever clothes and armor they wore in life. Some still carry the same ancient gear and weapons, but they tend to swap their deteriorating weapons for newer ones taken from victims whenever they can. For an unknown reason, Stygian skeletons favor fighting with two short swords or with one short sword and their own filthy, infected claws.

Having been veteran warriors in life, Stygian skeletons are excellent tacticians. They employ enveloping maneuvers, timing, and even ruses in combat. They are smart enough to know when a battle is lost and withdraw to save themselves. Most, however, simply fight until one side or the other is destroyed, driven by some unseen hatred for the living.
