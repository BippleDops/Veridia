# Disease and Plague System

## Crystal Corruption
- Exposure Clock (0–6). Each tick adds crystal filigree under skin.
- Stage Effects:
  - 1–2: Itch and shimmer; disadvantage vs. charm (hyper-focus).
  - 3–4: Pain spikes; -1 to STR/DEX checks; can siphon light for 1 minute.
  - 5–6: Crystallized thoughts; must speak truth in Quiet Chapels; gain resistance to radiant.
- Cure: Verdant salve, shard-hum counter-ritual, or guardian consent.

## Pressure Sickness
- Build over rapid depth shifts. On failure: 1 Fatigue and nausea.
- Treatment: Slow equalization at Pressure Gates; tea of deep kelp; short rest with constitution tonic.

## Void Madness
- Triggered by exposure to abyssal silence; whispers invite bargains.
- Stages:
  - Edge: -1 to Insight; advantage to detect lies (paranoia bias).
  - Split: Disadvantage on group checks; advantage on solitary stealth.
  - Embrace: Immune to fear; compelled toward abyssal sites.
- Recovery: Sun-songs, community meals, vow in Quiet Chapel.

## Hooks and Procedures
- On failed exposure checks, add clues to cures rather than block progress.
- Quarantine provides time to roleplay bonds; offer side-objectives inside.
