# Investigators Anonymous
*"Truth Rises Like Bubbles, Even From The Deepest Lies"*

## Organization Overview

Investigators Anonymous represents the most sophisticated intelligence and investigation network in [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Aquabyssos World Overview|Aquabyssos]], operating as a secret society dedicated to uncovering truth regardless of political consequences. Founded by refugees from law enforcement agencies who became disgusted with corruption and cover-ups, the organization fills the crucial gap between official investigators (who are often compromised) and criminal information brokers (who care only about profit).

Unlike traditional detective agencies, Investigators Anonymous operates on principles of absolute anonymity and collective knowledge sharing. Members never know each other's identities, cases are distributed through coded networks, and payment comes not in currency but in information exchange. The organization has evolved into something between a professional guild and a philosophical movement, united by the belief that truth-seeking is both a sacred duty and a necessary tool for survival in the transformed world.

The Investigators maintain vast databases of unsolved mysteries, criminal patterns, and hidden connections throughout the depths. Their work spans from personal missing persons cases to investigations of major political conspiracies, always operating in the shadows while serving clients who seek answers that official channels cannot or will not provide.

## History and Foundation

### The Great Corruption Scandal (350 years post-Drowning)
The organization emerged from the aftermath of a massive corruption scandal that revealed how deeply the early [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Aquabyssos World Overview#Government The Depth Hierarchy|Depth Hierarchy]] government had been compromised. When several high-ranking officials were discovered selling government positions to [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Aquabyssos World Overview#The Deep Dreamers|Deep Dreamers]] infiltrators, the scandal destroyed public trust in official investigations.

### The Anonymous Accords (348 years post-Drowning)
**Detective-Prime Clarity Truthseeker** and twelve other disgraced law enforcement officials established the founding principles of Investigators Anonymous: absolute anonymity for operatives, shared intelligence networks, and independence from all political factions. They established the first "Archive of Questions" - a hidden repository of unsolved cases and suspicious activities.

### The Network Expansion (320-280 years post-Drowning)
As political instability increased throughout the depths, demand for independent investigation services grew exponentially. The organization expanded from a local group to a depth-spanning network, establishing communication protocols that allowed members to collaborate without ever meeting face-to-face.

### The Code Wars (250 years post-Drowning)
When several governments attempted to infiltrate and control the organization, Investigators Anonymous developed increasingly sophisticated counter-intelligence methods. The "Code Wars" period saw the creation of their current cell-based structure and unbreakable anonymous communication systems.

## Leadership Structure

### The Anonymous Hierarchy
**The Anonymous Inquisitor**: The current supreme leader, whose identity is unknown even to other leadership figures. They coordinate major operations through encrypted communications and are suspected to be someone with high-level access to multiple faction intelligence networks. Even their gender and transformation status are unknown.

### The Question Council
Seven senior investigators who each specialize in different types of cases and maintain different aspects of the organization:

#### **The Archivist** (Case Management)
Maintains the central database of cases, evidence, and patterns. Responsible for assigning cases to appropriate investigators and tracking progress across the network.

#### **The Networker** (Communications)  
Manages the complex web of coded communications that allows anonymous coordination. Creates new security protocols and monitors for infiltration attempts.

#### **The Patron** (Client Relations)
Handles intake of new cases and manages payment/information exchange systems. The only leadership member who has any contact with non-members.

#### **The Hunter** (Active Operations)
Coordinates ongoing investigations requiring multiple investigators or dangerous fieldwork. Specializes in cases involving criminal organizations or hostile factions.

#### **The Keeper** (Security & Counter-Intelligence)
Protects the organization from infiltration, handles internal security threats, and maintains the anonymity systems that keep the organization functional.

#### **The Scholar** (Analysis & Research)
Analyzes patterns across multiple cases, maintains historical databases, and provides research support for complex investigations requiring academic expertise.

#### **The Judge** (Ethics & Standards)
Ensures investigations adhere to the organization's moral code, arbitrates disputes between members, and makes decisions about which cases the organization should or should not accept.

### The Investigation Ranks

#### **Truth-Seekers** (Field Investigators)
200+ active investigators working individual cases. Each uses coded identification and specializes in different investigation types: financial crimes, missing persons, political corruption, factional conflicts, or supernatural mysteries.

#### **Evidence-Gatherers** (Support Specialists)  
150+ members who provide specialized support: surveillance, forensic analysis, document procurement, witness protection, or technical infiltration.

#### **Information-Brokers** (Intelligence Network)
300+ part-time contacts throughout Aquabyssos society who provide tips, access, and local intelligence. Most don't know they're part of a larger organization.

## Members and Resources

### Recruitment Philosophy
Investigators Anonymous recruits from among individuals who have been failed by official systems: wrongfully accused criminals, victims of corruption, witnesses to cover-ups, and professionals disgusted by institutional failures. The organization seeks people with investigation skills but more importantly, those with personal commitment to truth-seeking.

### The Anonymous Protocol
All members operate under strict anonymity rules:
- **No Real Names**: All interactions use coded identifications
- **No Face-to-Face Meetings**: All communication through secure, anonymous channels  
- **Compartmentalized Knowledge**: Members know only what they need for their specific cases
- **Payment in Information**: Services exchanged for intelligence rather than currency
- **Emergency Protocols**: Methods for protecting identity if captured or compromised

### Organizational Resources

## Goals and Methods

### Primary Objectives

#### **Truth Above Politics**
The organization's core mission is uncovering truth regardless of political consequences. They take cases that official investigators won't touch due to political pressure, and they pursue evidence wherever it leads.

#### **Justice for the Forgotten**
Investigators Anonymous specializes in cases involving individuals who lack power or connections: missing commoners, fraud victims, witnesses to corruption, and anyone whose cases have been ignored or covered up by official channels.

#### **Pattern Recognition**
By maintaining comprehensive databases across all their cases, the organization identifies criminal patterns, conspiracy networks, and systemic corruption that individual investigations might miss.

#### **Institutional Independence**
The organization works to remain completely independent from all political factions, governments, and power structures, allowing them to investigate anyone without conflict of interest.

### Investigation Methodologies

#### **Anonymous Collaboration**
Multiple investigators can work different aspects of the same case without knowing each other's identities, allowing for sophisticated operations while maintaining security.

#### **Information Trading**
The organization operates on an economy of information exchange, where investigators pay for services with intelligence rather than currency, creating a network of mutual obligation and shared knowledge.

#### **Ethical Standards**
All investigations must adhere to strict ethical codes: no evidence fabrication, protection of innocent parties, respect for client confidentiality, and refusal to enable harm through their discoveries.

#### **Counter-Intelligence Operations**  
The organization actively protects itself from infiltration and manipulation, using sophisticated counter-surveillance and security protocols developed through decades of experience.
