## Description
A skein of string can cover a multitude of sins. Useful not only as wicks and draw-strings to seal opened [[Bags|bags]], string can also temporarily jury-rig most any laboratory setup. We offer a white, resilient and absorbent string (3 sp per 50 feet) that comes from a Maztican material crop, as well as the more familiar flaxen string (2 sp per 50 feet) from the Shining Plains. For an added 3 cp per 50 feet, we offer black, red, and yellow string. All our string can hold up to 15 pounds before fraying.

## Additional Details
a skein of 1000 feet is required for a complete laboratory
