## Special Traits
**Spore Infection:** A creature that fails the DC 11 Constitution saving throw against a phycomid's fluid glob attack is infected with the plant's spores. Tiny mushroomlike growths sprout from the creature's body. These look like fine, white hairs at first, but after 10 minutes they become recognizable as distinct mushroom shapes. An infected creature takes 1 acid damage and its maximum number of hit points declines by 1 at the start of each of its turns, until the infestation is ended with a lesser restoration spell or comparable magic, or by spending `dice: 2d4` rounds burning away the phycomid spores or scraping them off with a dagger or other edged weapon. Scraping or burning causes 2 (`dice: 1d4`) slashing or fire damage per round. A creature can't take any other actions during a round when it is destroying a spore infection. If a creature dies while infected, its body immediately sprouts a new, full-strength phycomid.

## Actions
**Fluid Glob:*** Ranged Attack*: +2 to hit, range 20 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (`dice: 1d8`) acid damage and the target must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be infected by phycomid spores (see above).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Underground

**Organization**: Solitary or patch (2–5)

## Description
A patch of phycomids is often found growing in garbage heaps, refuse pits, and other such dark, moist places with plenty of rotting organic material for the phycomid to feed on. A typical patch covers an area of 4 to 5 square feet. The exact number of mushroom growths making up a patch varies wildly.

Phycomids themselves are highly variable. The caps of phycomid mushrooms can be white, red, purple, or yellow, but the stalk of the plant is always milky white or off-white. The mushrooms range from less than an inch tall to a foot or more, with an average of 8 inches.

What all phycomids have in common, and what makes them unique among fungi, is that the body of the plant forms a hollow tube, similar in some ways to a clam’s siphon. This tube opens through the cap of the mushroom, but the opening usually is kept tightly closed. It opens only when the phycomid “attacks” by “spitting” an oozy, liquidy glob of slime at a nearby living creature. This slime contains the phycomid’s reproductive spores. The acid of the slime eats into the target, allowing the spores to take root in the wound and then spread quickly throughout the creature, inside and out.
