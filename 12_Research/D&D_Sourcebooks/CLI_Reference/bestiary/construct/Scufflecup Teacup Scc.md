*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 159* Scufflecup is a game students created after finding a box of teacups in a nearby building's storage room. The students discovered that pouring hot tea into the cups animates them for 10 minutes and causes them to sprout little arms and legs.```statblock
