--- # Sphere of Crushing Doom

*Generic Hazard* The court jester devised a deadly trap to foil anyone who sought to steal his magic fool's cap. The jester's tomb is located at the end of a 10-foot-wide, 150-foot-long hallway that descends sharply from north to south. The entrance to the tomb is a door on the eastern wall at the bottom of the slope, at the south end of the hall. *Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 119* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Sphere of crushing doom xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
