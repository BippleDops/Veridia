This magnificent necropolis-parliament serves as both the seat of [Parliament of Echoes|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Parliament Of Echoes]] and a testament to the idea that death should not disqualify one from civic participation in an undead society. The chamber itself is a marvel of necromantic architecture, built within what was once the grand cathedral of the surface capital. Massive bone buttresses support a vaulted ceiling decorated with the preserved remains of pre-drowning stained glass, now telling stories of transformation and undeath rather than divine salvation. The entire complex operates on the principle that consciousness, not biology, determines citizenship rights. ### The Democratic Covet

When [[The Great Drowning transformed most of the surface world's political class into various forms of undead, the surviving governmental structures faced a crisis: should the transformed politicians retain their positions? The Democratic Covet, signed in blood and ectoplasm, established that citizenship transcends biological status. ### The First Undead Session

The initial post-drowning parliamentary session was chaotic, with undead senators forgetting parliamentary procedure, ghost representatives unable to physically vote, and zombie congressmen eating the legislation. However, over time, specialized protocols were developed to accommodate the unique needs of deceased democracy. ### Evolution of Undead Rights

The Eternal Senate has become the primary advocate for undead rights throughout [Aquabyssos]], establishing legal frameworks for:
- Spectral property ownership
- Undead marriage and civil unions
- Rights of the recently deceased
- Protection from necromantic exploitation
- Ethical guidelines for resurrection magic ### Chamber of Eternal Debate

The main parliamentary floor where legislative sessions take place. The chamber modifieded with specialized speaking platforms for different types of undead representatives—floating podiums for ghosts, reinforced stands for zombies, and sealed chambers for more dangerous undead forms. **Unique Features:**
- Spectral amplification system for ghost voices
- Necromantic lighting that doesn't harm undead vision
- Temperature control for various undead comfort needs
- Preservation fields to prevent undead decay during long sessions
- Emergency containment systems for unstable undead ### The Spectral Gallery

**[[The Spectral Gallery|Full Details**

Public viewing area where citizens (both living and undead) can observe parliamentary proceedings. The gallery includes special seating arrangements for different types of undead and living visitors, with privacy screens for those whose undead forms might be disturbing to others. ### The Voting Crypts

Private voting chambers designed to accommodate senators who cannot safely interact with others due to their undead nature. Each crypt is customized for different types of undead, with appropriate environmental controls and security measures. **Voting Methods:**
- **Traditional:** Living senators use standard ballot systems
- **Spectral:** Ghosts manifest their votes as ectoplasmic signatures
- **Empathic:** Wraiths project their intentions directly
- **Symbolic:** Intelligent zombies arrange objects to indicate choices ### Memory Archive Vaults

Extensive libraries containing the complete legislative history of both pre and post-drowning governments. The archives serve as institutional memory, particularly important since many undead senators have memory issues. ### The Speaker's Throne

Elaborately carved throne that serves as the seat of the Eternal Speaker, the parliament's presiding officer. The throne incorporates necromantic enchantments that allow it to accommodate speakers of any undead type while providing them with enhanced authority and mental clarity. ### The Eternal Speaker

**[People]]**

The parliamentary leader who presides over sessions and maintains order. The current Speaker is a lich who died during the drowning but retained their political acumen and dedication to democratic principles. **Powers and Responsibilities:**
- Maintain order during debates
- Recognize speakers and manage speaking time
- Interpret parliamentary procedure for undead needs
- Cast tie-breaking votes
- Represent the parliament in external relations #### The Original Senators

Politicians who served before the drowning and retained their positions after death. They tend to be conservative, focused on maintaining pre-drowning governmental traditions adapted for undead society. **Key Issues:**
- Preserving democratic institutions
- Maintaining connection to pre-drowning law
- Protecting undead rights and dignity
- Resisting radical changes to goverce #### Shadow Replacements

Senators whose original consciousness replaceded by shadow entities, though they maintain their political positions. They often have different agendas than the original politicians they replaced. **Key Issues:**
- Shadow integration into society
- Expanding shadow rights and recognition
- Reforming laws that discriminate against shadow entities
- Secret coordination with [[The Shadow Trade Network|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/The Shadow Trade Network #### The Transcended

Politicians who have evolved beyond simple undeath into more complex forms of post-mortem existence. They advocate for progressive policies and societal evolution. **Key Issues:**
- Advancing undead society beyond mere survival
- Exploring new forms of consciousness and existence
- Building relationships with other supernatural entities
- Developing post-biological social structures #### New Death Faction

Recently deceased individuals who were elected to represent the interests of the newly undead and those still transitioning from life to death. **Key Issues:**
- Support for recent drowning victims
- Transition services for new undead
- Bridge-building between living and dead communities
- Reform of outdated undeath policies #### The Shadow Citizenship Act

Controversial legislation that would grant full citizenship rights to shadow entities, including shadow replacements of living people. The bill has created deep divisions within the senate. **Support Arguments:**
- Shadows demonstrate consciousness and agency
- Discrimination based on origin violates equality principles
- Shadow entities contribute to society
- Integration is better than segregation **Opposition Arguments:**
- Shadows may be displaced souls rather than true individuals
- Security risks from entities with unclear origins
- Potential for shadow takeover of democratic institutions
- Ethical concerns about identity theft #### Undead Labor Protection Act

Legislation designed to prevent exploitation of undead workers, particularly zombies and skeletons who are often treated as mindless labor. #### The Memory Preservation Initiative

**[[The Clerk of Souls** - Unknown entity
- Records all parliamentary proceedings in mystical ledgers
- Appears as different forms to different observers
- Never speaks except to clarify procedural points
- May be the embodied spirit of democracy itself ### Negative Energy Concentration

The high concentration of undead creates areas of intense negative energy that can be harmful to living visitors:
- ****DC 14** Constitution saves** to avoid temporary level drain
- Living creatures may experience existential dread
- Healing magic is less effective in the chamber ### Temporal Distortions

Intense political debates create localized time anomalies:
- Some debates echo from multiple time periods
- Filibusters can literally slow down time
- Important votes may repeat until they achieve consensus
- Parliamentary procedure exists in multiple temporal states ### Psychic Resoce

The emotional intensity of undead political passion creates psychic effects:
- Sensitive individuals may experience undead memories

**40% of senators are shadow replacements**, but this information is classified to prevent political chaos. The real number may be even higher, with some shadows having replaced other shadows. ### The Living Conspiracy

A secret faction of living senators is working to gradually reduce undead political power, believing that death should disqualify political participation. ### The Memory Merchants

Several senators are secretly selling their pre-drowning memories to [Memory Farmers|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/Memory Farmers]], compromising their ability to represent their original constituencies. ### The Resurrection Clause

Buried in parliamentary procedure is a clause that would dissolve the entire undead government if a way to resurrect all drowning victims were discovered. ### The Speaker's True Nature

The Eternal Speaker may not be a lich but rather a collective consciousness formed from all the pre-drowning political leaders who died during the catastrophe. ### Political Intrigue

1. **The Shadow Citizenship Vote:** The controversial Shadow Citizenship Act comes to a vote, and various factions are using increasingly desperate measures to influence the outcome. Players must navigate political manipulation, assassination attempts, and moral complexities to ensure a fair democratic process. 2. **The Missing Senators:** Three senators have disappeared in the past month, and their empty seats are affecting crucial votes. Investigation reveals a conspiracy that goes to the heart of undead democracy and threatens the entire governmental system. ### Investigation

3. **The Memory Thief:** Someone is stealing the memories of undead senators, leaving them unable to remember their political positions or constituent needs. Players must identify the culprit and restore the stolen memories before the government collapses into chaos. 4. **The False Replacement:** A living senator claims that their undead colleague is actually a shadow replacement, but proving this requires delving into the dangerous politics of identity and consciousness in undead society. ### Moral Dilemmas

5. **The Resurrection Referendum:** Evidence emerges that mass resurrection of drowning victims is possible, but it would dissolve the undead government and potentially harm those who have adapted to undeath. Players must help decide whether to pursue resurrection or preserve undead society. 6. **The Living Rights Movement:** A growing movement of living citizens argues that undead senators cannot truly represent living interests. Players must mediate between groups while addressing legitimate concerns about representation and democracy. ### Social Challenges

7. **The Diplomatic Crisis:** Foreign governments refuse to recognize the legitimacy of undead democracy, threatening trade and political relationships. Players must serve as diplomats to convince skeptical living governments that undead societies can be legitimate democracies. 8. **The Succession Crisis:** The Eternal Speaker is showing signs of final dissolution, and the various factions cannot agree on a replacement. Players must help manage the succession while preventing the government from falling into chaos. ## Random Encounters (d10) | Roll | Encounter |
