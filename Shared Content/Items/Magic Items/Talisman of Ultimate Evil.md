## Description
This item symbolizes unrepentant evil. A creature that is neither good nor evil in [[2 - Alignment|alignment]] takes `dice: 6d6` (6d6) [[17 - Damage and Healing|necrotic]] damage upon touching the talisman. A good creature takes `dice: 8d6` (8d6) [[17 - Damage and Healing|necrotic]] damage upon touching the talisman. Either sort of creature takes the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.

If you are an evil [[Cleric|cleric]] or [[Paladin|paladin]], you can use the talisman as a holy [[Symbol|symbol]], and you gain a +2 bonus to [[2 - Casting a Spell|spell attack]] rolls while you wear or hold it.

The talisman has 6 charges. If you are wearing or holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the talisman and choose one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the target is of good [[2 - Alignment|alignment]], a flaming fissure opens under it. The target must succeed on a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 20 [[Dexterity|Dexterity]] saving throw or [[9 - The Environment|fall]] into the fissure and be destroyed, leaving no remains. The fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman dissolves into foul-smelling slime and is destroyed.
