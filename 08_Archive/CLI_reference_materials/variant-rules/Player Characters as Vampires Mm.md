# Player Characters as Vampires
*Source: Monster Manual p. 295, Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft p. 236* 

The game statistics of a player character transformed into a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/vampire-spawn-xmm|vampire spawn]] and then a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/vampire-xmm|vampire]] don't change, except that the character's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores become 18 if they aren't higher. In addition, the character gains the vampire's damage resistances, [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/senses#Darkvision|darkvision]], traits, and actions. Attack and damage rolls for the vampire's attacks are based on Strength. The save DC for Charm is 8 + the vampire's proficiency bonus + the vampire's Charisma modifier. The character's alignment becomes lawful evil, and the DM might take control of the character until the vampirism is reversed with a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish-xphb|wish]] spell or the character is killed and brought back to life.
