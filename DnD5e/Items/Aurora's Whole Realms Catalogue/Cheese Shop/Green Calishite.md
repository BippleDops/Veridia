## Description
Sample at your own risk, for the management accepts no responsibility for those who think this just another cheese. The Calishites mix ground curry in with their cheese as a preservative and flavor-enhancer. And what flavor it has! Many a northern barbarian has been brought low by grabbing a hunk of Green, thinking it an ordinary cheese, and biting in. The curry gives [[Calishite]] its radiant aquamarine hue as well, serving as a warning to the uninitiated. Available in ½ lb loaves (4 sp), but special orders may be made through your local station.
