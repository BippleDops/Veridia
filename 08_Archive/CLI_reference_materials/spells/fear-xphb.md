# Fear
*3rd-level, Illusion*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Cone)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a white feather)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each creature in a 30-foot [Cone](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb.md) must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and have the [Frightened](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Frightened) condition for the duration.

A [Frightened](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Frightened) creature takes the [Dash](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Dash) action and moves away from you by the safest route on each of its turns unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a space where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends on that creature.
