While holding this weapon, you can take a [[Action Xphb]] to alter its form, turning it into a 6-inch rod (for ease of storage) or a 10-foot pole, or reverting it a Quarterstaff; the weapon will elongate only as far as the surrounding space allows. In certain forms, the weapon has the following additional properties. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Acrobatic Assist (Quarterstaff and 10-Foot Pole Forms Only) While holding this weapon, you have [[Advantage Xphb]] on Dexterity ([[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]) checks. ## Attack Deflection (Quarterstaff Form Only) When you are hit by an attack while holding the weapon, you can take a [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules)]] to twirl the weapon around you, gaining a +5 bonus to your [[armor-class-xphb (variant-rules)]] against the triggering attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you. You can't use this property again until you finish a [[short-rest-xphb]] or [[long-rest-xphb]]. ## Ranged Weapon (Quarterstaff Form Only) This weapon has [[item properties#Thrown|Thrown]] with a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet.
