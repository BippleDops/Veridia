# Archon Meredith Saltweaver

## Overview
Archon Meredith Saltweaver rules [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/New Tethys]] and the [[Tethyan Hegemony]] with an iron fist wrapped in silk. A master politician and powerful hydromancer, she maintains her position through careful manipulation, strategic alliances, and rumored dark pacts. She appears as a regal woman in her 50s, though magic keeps her looking younger. Her skin has a blue-green tint from partial adaptation, and her eyes glow with an unsettling cerulean light.

## Personality
- **Public Face**: Charismatic, reasonable, concerned for citizens' welfare
- **True Nature**: Ruthlessly pragmatic, paranoid, increasingly influenced by whispers
- **Motivations**: Maintain power, prepare for [[The Emergence]], serve hidden masters
- **Fears**: Loss of control, full transformation, the truth being revealed

## Abilities
- Master hydromancer specializing in control and divination
- Can breathe both air and water indefinitely
- Telepathic connection to water within 1 mile
- Political genius with networks everywhere
- Resistant to mind-affecting magic (or so she believes)

## Relationships

## History
Born to merchant family before the drowning's completion, Meredith witnessed the final transformations of the surface world. She maneuvered through the chaos to seize power, supposedly making a deal with something in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Cerulean Trench]] for the strength to rule. Has ruled New Tethys for 47 years.

## Current Activities
