# Javelin of Lightning
*Weapon ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/javelin-xphb|javelin]]), uncommon*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/javelin-of-lightning.webp#right)

- **Damage**: 1d6 piercing
- **Range**: 30/120
- **Properties**: [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties#Thrown|Thrown]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

Each time you make an attack roll with this magic weapon and hit, you can have it deal Lightning damage instead of Piercing damage.

## Lightning Bolt

When you throw this weapon at a target no farther than 120 feet from you, you can forgo making a ranged attack roll and instead turn the weapon into a bolt of lightning. This bolt forms a 5-foot-wide [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/line-area-of-effect-xphb|Line]] between you and the target. The target and each other creature in the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/line-area-of-effect-xphb|Line]] (excluding you) makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking `4d6` Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Immediately after dealing this damage, the weapon reappears in your hand. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.
