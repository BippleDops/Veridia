# Purist Coalition Thugs
*The Clean Blade Movement, Crystal Breakers, Guardians of Natural Order*

## Overview
The Purist Coalition Thugs represent the militant arm of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor's anti-crystal corruption movement, believing that the widespread use of [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aether Crystals|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aether Crystals]] is slowly poisoning both the land and its people. What began as a legitimate philosophical movement questioning magical dependence has evolved into a violent extremist organization that uses terrorism, sabotage, and assassination to "purify" the kingdom from crystal influence. They see themselves as freedom fighters saving civilization from magical addiction, but their methods often harm innocent civilians caught between ideology and pragmatism.

## History

### The Great Awakening (75 Years Ago)
**Recognition of the Threat**
- Founded by [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Brother Marcus Steelbane, a former crystal miner who witnessed corruption firsthand
- Initial movement focused on education about crystal addiction dangers
- Documented cases of crystal sickness and magical dependency syndrome
- Established support groups for those seeking to reduce magical reliance
- Published "The Natural Path" manifesto outlining philosophy

### The Radicalization (50 Years Ago)
**From Philosophy to Violence**
- Frustrated by government inaction on crystal regulation
- Witnessed [02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Silverscale Consortium|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/The Silverscale Consortium]] suppression of anti-crystal research
- First violent incident: bombing of crystal refinery killing 12 workers
- Split from mainstream anti-crystal movement
- Adopted cell-based organization structure for security

### The Underground War (25 Years Ago)
**Peak Militant Activity**
- Coordinated attacks across multiple crystal facilities
- Assassinated three prominent crystal researchers
- Developed "Crystal Bane" alchemical compounds to neutralize magical effects
- Infiltrated government positions to access crystal distribution networks
- Created martyr culture around "pure sacrifice" for the cause

### Modern Extremism (Last 10 Years)
**Evolution and Desperation**
- Increasingly isolated from mainstream society
- Adopted more extreme interpretations of original philosophy
- Began targeting civilians using crystal-enhanced items
- Formed alliances with other anti-establishment groups
