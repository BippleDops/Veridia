# Laughing Water (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust and a seed from any green plant)

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
You transform up to a gallon of water into sweet, sparkling, gently glowing *laughing water*.

Imbibing at least a mouthful of laughing water removes any levels of exhaustion the drinker may have and cures blindness, deafness, disease, and incapacitation.

You may also throw a vial at a fiend or undead creature; on a successful hit, it causes 4d6 radiant damage.
