_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_ The region containing an adult or ancient red dragon's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects: - **Burning Heat.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is an area of extreme heat. A burning creature or object takes an additional`d4`Fire damage at the start of each of its turns. - **Smoldering Haze.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is [[lightly-obscured-xphb (variant-rules) with clouds of ash. Whenever a creature other than the dragon or one of its allies finishes a [long-rest-xphb]] in that area, that creature must succeed on a **DC 15** Constitution saving throw or have the [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned condition for 1 hour. If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. ## Player-Facing Summary Red dragon xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of red dragon xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around red dragon xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Related Notes - [Similar Topic 1]]
