## Description
This frothy ale is almost sinister in appearance, with pale yellow foam atop a cloudy brown bubbly liquid. Despite a daunting demeanor, this ale is excellent, with a light bitter taste. Brewed in [[Shadowdale]], this ale travels easily and is found as far away as Luiren; many adventurers who first tasted this fine brew at the Old Skull are glad to have its familiar taste in any major cityâ€™s taverns. Hand keg, 17 cp; cask, 1 gp; barrel, 35 sp; butt, 9 gp; tun, 18 gp.
