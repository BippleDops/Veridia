# Helm of Telepathy
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/helm-of-telepathy.webp#right)

While wearing this helm, you have telepathy with a range of 30 feet, and you can cast [[detect-thoughts-xphb|Detect Thoughts]] or [[suggestion-xphb|Suggestion]] (save DC 13) from the helm. Once either spell is cast from the helm, that spell can't be cast from it again until the next dawn.
