## Fruit of Restoration

One plant in your Greenhouse has three magical fruits growing on it. Any creature that eats one of these fruits gains the benefit of a [[lesser restoration xphb|Lesser Restoration]] spell. Fruits that aren't eaten within 24 hours of being picked lose their magic. The plant replaces all picked fruits daily at dawn, and it can't be transplanted without killing it.

## Harvest Options

When you issue the "Harvest" order to this facility, choose one of the following options:

- **Harvest.** Healing Herbs. You commission the facility's hireling to create a [[potion of greater healing xdmg|Potion of Healing (greater)]] made from healing herbs. The work takes 7 days and costs no money.  
- **Harvest.** Poison. You commission the facility's hireling to extract one application of a poison from rare plants or fungi. Choose the type of poison from the following options: [[assassins blood xdmg|Assassin's Blood]], [[malice xdmg|Malice]], [[pale tincture xdmg|Pale Tincture]], or [[truth serum xdmg|Truth Serum]]. See ""Poison"" in "chapter 3" for each poison's effect. Once harvested, the poison can be contained in a vial. The work takes 7 days and costs no money.

## Player-Facing Summary

Greenhouse is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of greenhouse as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around greenhouse.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
