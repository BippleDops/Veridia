**Sylvan Forest Encounters**

| d12 + d8 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 2 | 1 [[displacer-beast-xmm|displacer beast]] |
| 3 | 1 [[gnoll-pack-lord-xmm|gnoll pack lord]] and `2d4` [[gnoll-warrior-xmm|gnolls]] |
| 4 | `d4` [[gnoll-warrior-xmm|gnolls]] and `2d4` [[hyena-xmm|hyenas]] |
| 5 | A grove of burned trees. Characters searching the area and succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom ([[skills#Survival|Survival]]) check find [[gnoll-warrior-xmm|gnoll]] tracks. Following the tracks for `d4` hours leads to an encounter with [[gnoll-warrior-xmm|gnolls]], or the discovery of dead [[gnoll-warrior-xmm|gnolls]] with elven arrows sticking out of their flea-ridden corpses. |
| 6 | 1 [[giant-owl-xmm|giant owl]] |
| 7 | An ivy-covered statue of an elven deity or hero. |
| 8 | 1 [[dryad-xmm|dryad]] (50%) or `d4` [[satyr-xmm|satyrs]] (50%) |
| 9 | `d4` [[centaur-trooper-xmm|centaurs]] |
| 10 | `2d4` [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout-xmm|scouts]] (elves). One [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout-xmm|scout]] carries a horn and can use its action to blow it. If the horn is blown within the forest, roll on this table again. If the result indicates a monster encounter, the indicated monster or monsters arrive in `d4` minutes. New arrivals other than [[gnoll-warrior-xmm|gnolls]], [[hyena-xmm|hyenas]], [[owlbear-xmm|owlbears]], and [[displacer-beast-xmm|displacer beasts]] are friendly toward the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout-xmm|scouts]]. |
| 11 | `2d4` [[pixie-xmm|pixies]] (50%) or `2d4` [[sprite-xmm|sprites]] (50%) |
| 12 | 1 [[owlbear-xmm|owlbear]] |
| 13 | `d4` [[elk-xmm|elks]] (75%) or 1 [[giant-elk-xmm|giant elk]] (25%) |
| 14 | `d4` [[blink-dog-xmm|blink dogs]] |
| 15 | A magical plant with `2d4` glowing berries. A creature that ingests a berry becomes [[conditions#Invisible|invisible]] for 1 hour, or until it attacks or casts a spell. Once picked, a berry loses its magic after 12 hours. Berries regrow at midnight, but if all its berries are picked, the plant becomes nonmagical and grows no more berries. |
| 16 | An elven tune carried on a gentle breeze |
| 17 | `d4` [[faerie-dragon-youth-xmm|orange]] (75%) or [[faerie-dragon-adult-xmm|blue]] (25%) faerie dragons |
| 18 | 1 [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/druid-xmm|druid]] (elf). The [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/druid-xmm|druid]] is initially indifferent toward the party but becomes friendly if the characters agree to rid the forest of its gnoll infestation. |
| 19 | 1 [[treant-xmm|treant]]. The [[treant-xmm|treant]] is friendly if the party includes one or more elves or is accompanied by a visible fey creature. The [[treant-xmm|treant]] is hostile if the characters are carrying open flames. Otherwise, it is indifferent and doesn't announce its presence as the characters pass by. |
| 20 | 1 [[unicorn-xmm|unicorn]] |
