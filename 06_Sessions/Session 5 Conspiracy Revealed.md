In the great Parliament chambers, hastily repaired after the recent attack, representatives from every corner of the underwater realm debate frantically. Some call for immediate mobilization, others for diplomatic solutions, while a few whisper of ancient powers that could end the threat forever. **[Current Situation]] Assessment**:
- **[[Surface Fleet**: 12 warships approaching, ETA 18 hours
- **[Parliament Status]]**: Divided between military and diplomatic responses
- **[[Ancient Technology**: Various levels of access depending on party's Session 4 choices
- **[Modified Citizens]]**: Recovery efforts ongoing, some still unaccounted for
- **[[Public Mood**: Fear mixed with determination, unity against external threat **Party's Position**:
- **Heroes of the Realm**: Recognized as key investigators who uncovered the conspiracy
- **[Critical Intelligence]]**: Only the party knows the full scope of the surface world threat
- **[[Political Influence**: Their recommendations will carry significant weight
- **[Time Pressure]]**: Must present comprehensive strategy to Parliament within hours ### [[The Intelligence Brief **[Harbor Master]] [[Luna Freedrift's Summary** (based on party's discoveries): > "What you've uncovered changes everything we thought we knew about this crisis. This isn't just about stolen ships or political corruption—it's about the fundamental relationship between our civilizations. The surface world has been planning this for years, possibly decades. But there are also elements within their leadership who may be open to genuine negotiation." **[Key Intelligence]] Revealed**:
1. **[[Surface Fleet Capabilities**: Advanced weapons incorporating ancient Aquabyssos technology
2. **[Invasion Timeline]]**: Detailed schedule with specific targets and objectives
3. **[[Internal Surface Politics**: Not all surface world leaders support the invasion
4. Subsequently, **[Ancient Power]] Sources**: Extent of technology that could shift the balance
5. **[[Modified Agent Network**: How many surface world agents remain in Aquabyssos
6. **[Diplomatic Options]]**: Potential paths to peaceful resolution ### Parliament's [[War Council **[The Assembled]] Leadership**: **[[Speaker Coralia Deepsong**: - **Position**: Seeks diplomatic solution but prepared for military response
- **Concerns**: Civilian casualties, long-term consequences of war
- **Resources**: Full parliamentary authority, but limited military experience **[Admiral Blackwater]]**:
- **Position**: Advocates for preemptive military strike
- **Concerns**: Aquabyssos military inferiority, need for every advantage
- **Resources**: Naval forces, strategic knowledge, military experience **[[Ambassador Nerida Deepcurrent**:
- **Position**: Desperate to find diplomatic alternative
- **Concerns**: Total war would devastate both civilizations
- **Resources**: Communication channels, knowledge of surface world culture **[The Ancient]] Guardian** (if party gained its alliance):
- **Position**: Offers power to defend Aquabyssos, but at cost of isolation
- **Concerns**: Preventing surface world domination without repeating ancient mistakes
- **Resources**: [[First Throne technology, ancient knowledge, pressure control ### Presenting the Intelligence **[The Full]] Brief** to Parliament leadership: **[[Surface World [Invasion Plan]]**: > "The surface fleet isn't just coming to occupy territory—they're coming to replace our civilization with one that serves their interests. Using ancient technology stolen from the facility, they can manipulate pressure itself as a weapon. Their plan is simple: demonstrate overwhelming force, then offer 'protection' to whoever submits." **[[The Modified [Agent Network]]**: Evidence from the facility reveals the extent of infiltration:
- **[[Parliament Members**: At least 3 confirmed, possibly more
- **[Military Officers]]**: Several key positions compromised
- **[[Civil Service**: Bureaucrats placed to enable invasion support
- **[Communication Systems]]**: Surface world has access to Aquabyssos communications **[[Ancient Technology Assessment**: Party must report on the status of [First Throne]] technology:
- **[[If Secured**: Aquabyssos has access to ancient defensive systems
- **[If Destroyed]]**: Neither side can use the dangerous power sources - **[[If Compromised**: Surface world may have partial access
- **[If Activated]]**: Ancient systems are awake but unpredictable ### [[Strategic Options Presented **[Military Response]] Options**: #### Option 3: [[Ancient Power Activation - **Strategy**: [Use First]] Throne technology to create impregnable defenses
- **Advantages**: Could create Aquabyssos completely invulnerable
- **Disadvantages**: [[Isolates Aquabyssos from surface world permanently
- **Requirements**: Party's cooperation with [Ancient Guardian]]
- **Consequences**: End of all surface-underwater relations **[[Diplomatic Response Options**: #### Option 6: Expose the Conspiracy - **Strategy**: Reveal surface world manipulation to their own people
- **Advantages**: Could cause surface world internal conflict
- **Disadvantages**: Requires proof that surface world citizens would believe
- **Requirements**: Communication with surface world, credible evidence
- **Consequences**: Internal surface world political crisis **[Hybrid Approaches]]**: Party can propose combinations of strategies:
- **Military + Diplomatic**: Negotiate while demonstrating strength
- **Ancient + Diplomatic**: Use ancient power as bargaining chip
- **Exposure + Military**: Political warfare backed by military preparation ### [[The Parliamentary Debate **[Different Factions]]** argue based on their perspectives: **[[The Military Hawks** (led by [Admiral Blackwater]]): > "Every moment we spend debating gives them more time to prepare. We know they have our stolen technology, we know they're coming to conquer us, and we know they've already infiltrated our government. The time for half-measures is over." **[[The Peace Faction** (led by [Ambassador Deepcurrent]]): > "War benefits no one except those who profit from destruction. There must be surface world leaders who can be reasoned with. If we attack first, we become the aggressors in their eyes and justify their conquest." **[[The Ancient Traditionalists** (if Guardian is allied):
> "Our ancestors faced this choice before and chose isolation over subjugation. The old ways protected us for centuries. Perhaps it is time to embrace that wisdom again, even at the cost of progress." **[The Pragmatic]] Moderates** (led by [[Speaker Deepsong):
> "We need solutions that preserve both our independence and our future. Whatever we choose, we must be able to live with the consequences for generations to come." ### [Individual Character]] Moments **[[Personal Stakes for [Party Members]]**: Each party member has opportunities to address personal connections to the crisis: - **Family/Friends**: Loved ones threatened by impending war

2. **[Modified Agents]]**: Convert captured infiltrators into communication channels
3. **[[Ambassador Network**: Official diplomatic channels (may be compromised)
4. **[Direct Approach]]**: Intercept invasion fleet directly for parley ### [[First Contact with [Surface Leadership]] **[[Admiral Cortez Ironwave** (if survived Session 4): > "Aquabyssos representatives, you've impressed me with your resourcefulness. I'm authorized to discuss terms, but understand—my government sent this fleet because diplomacy has failed before. You need to offer something we can't simply take by force." **[Surface World]] [[Negotiation Team**:
- **[Admiral Ironwave]]**: Military representative, pragmatic but demanding
- **[[Diplomat Sarah Wavelash**: Surface world ambassador, seeks peaceful solution

**[Aquabyssos Position]]**: Modification of citizens is violation of sovereignty
**[[Possible Compromises**: Prisoner exchange, rehabilitation programs #### 5. [Future Relations]] **[[Surface Position**: Formal alliance with surface world leadership
**[Aquabyssos Position]]**: Independence with friendly relations
**[[Possible Compromises**: Non-aggression pact, trade agreements ### [Diplomatic Skill]] Challenges **Multi-[[Stage Negotiation** requiring different approaches: **Stage 1: [Establishing Credibility]]** (**DC 16**) - **Persuasion**: [[Demonstrate Aquabyssos is serious about negotiation

- [[Speaker Coralia Deepsong - -- **[Adventure Conclusion]]** * [[The Sunken Conspiracy* concludes with the party having shaped the future relationship between two civilizations through their choices, courage, and dedication to justice. Whether through diplomatic triumph, military victory, ancient power, or some combination thereof, they have proven that individuals can create a difference in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges. The underwater realm of Aquabyssos will never be the same, but thanks to their efforts, it has a future—whatever form that future may take. In the crushing depths where pressure shapes all things, they have shown that the greatest pressure of all is the weight of moral choice, and that even in the darkness of conspiracy and betrayal, the light of truth can still shine through. The adventure ends, but the story of these heroes and the world they helped shape continues in whatever adventures await in the transformed relationship between the realms above and below the waves. <invoke name="<parameter name=" ## Player-[Facing Summary]] Session 5 [[Conspiracy Revealed is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
