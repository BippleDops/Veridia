# Scroll of Titan Summoning (Empyrean)
*Scroll, legendary*  

When you take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to read this scroll, an [[empyrean-xmm (miscellaneous)]] appears in an unoccupied space on the ground or in water that you can see within 1 mile of yourself.

The [[empyrean-xmm (miscellaneous)]] is [[Hostile Attitude Xphb]] toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]]. If the [[empyrean-xmm (miscellaneous)]] is summoned into a space that isn't large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted.
