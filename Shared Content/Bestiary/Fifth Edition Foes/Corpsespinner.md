*A massive, bone-white tarantula is the only way to describe this monster. Bands of gray and silver ring its abdomen and legs, and its body is covered in short, bristly hairs of white and silver. A large, skull-like marking appears on the creature’s thorax. Its eight eyes are stark white.*

## Special Traits
**Astral Jaunt:** A corpsespinner can shift between the Astral and Material Planes in either direction as a move. This does not trigger a reaction.

**Astralsense:** A corpsespinner can automatically sense the presence and location of anything within 200 feet of it on the Astral Plane.

**Create Corpsespun:** Creatures that die while affected by a corpsespinner's poison (and not devoured by the corpsespinner) rise in 1 hour as a [[Corpsespun|corpsespun]].

## Actions
**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 16 (`dice: 2d10+5`) piercing damage plus 5 (`dice: 1d10`) poison damage and the target is poisoned. A poisoned creature makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns; a successful save ends the condition.

**Web (Recharge 5—6):*** Ranged Attack:* +6 to hit, range 80 ft., one creature. Hit: the target is restrained. A restrained creature can use its action to attempt a DC 14 Strength (Athletics) check, becoming free of the webs on a success. A character has tactical disadvantage on this check on the Astral Plane. These webs can be destroyed with slashing damage (AC 12, 10 hp), but they are immune to all other damage, including fire.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Astral Plane

**Organization**: Solitary or troupe (1 plus 4–9 [[Corpsespun|corpsespun]])

## Description
Corpsespinners are highly aggressive extraplanar spiders originating on the Astral Plane, where they hunt and devour [[Astral Shark|astral sharks]] and other native creatures. Only rarely do they enter the Material Plane to hunt all types of giant spiders and humanoids.

On the Astral Plane, corpsespinners spend their time constructing elaborate webs. They enjoy using unusual anchor points for their constructions, such as bizarre outcroppings of rare materials, the corpses of deceased astral travelers, drifting astral ruins, and just about anything else the corpsespinner finds intriguing or unique.

When not constructing webs, the corpsespinner is usually hunting— and this sometimes leads it to the Material Plane. If encountered on the Material Plane, there is a good chance the corpsespinner has its most recent victims with it as [[Corpsespun|corpsespun]].

Corpsespinners seldom associate with others of their kind. Their ecology and reproduction cycles are unknown by outsiders, though intrepid interplanar adventurers have talked of seeing huge webbed lairs on the Astral Plane containing young corpsespinners.

When hunting on the Material Plane, a corpsespinner uses its ability to shift back and forth between the planes to confuse and stymy its foes. If facing defeat, the corpsespinner retreats to the Astral Plane and seeks the safety of its lair.

When accompanied by [[Corpsespun|corpsespun]], the corpsespinner focuses on trapping foes in webs and then lets its minions soften up the trapped enemies. The corpsespinner wants to ensure that their veins are filled with its poison when they die, to keep its supply of [[Corpsespun|corpsespun]] high.
