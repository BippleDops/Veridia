## Overview

Sage Driftwood is Aquabyssos's most renowned deep-sea navigator and oceanic philosopher, possessing an almost mystical understanding of underwater currents, tidal patterns, and the hidden [path]]ways that connect distant parts of the ocean realm. Known for her unconventional methods that blend scientific observation with intuitive wisdom, she has guided more successful deep-sea expeditions than any other navigator in the city's history.

Driftwood operates both as a practical navigator-for-hire and as a teacher of oceanic wisdom, training younger navigators while pursuing her own research into the deeper mysteries of oceanic consciousness and the spiritual aspects of underwater travel. Her unique philosophy views navigation not just as a technical skill, but as a form of communion with the sea itself.

Her services are in high demand as political tensions make safe travel increasingly important, while her neutral stance and deep understanding of oceanic patterns make her valuable to all factions.

## Appearance

Sage Driftwood is an elderly sea elf woman whose exact age is difficult to determine, appearing to be anywhere from sixty to several hundred years old. Her silver-green hair flows like seaweed, often adorned with small shells, bits of [[Coral, and trinkets collected from her travels. Her eyes are the deep blue-green of abyssal waters, seeming to hold depths of ancient knowledge.

She dresses in practical but elegant robes made from various aquatic materials - [Sea Silk]], kelp fiber, and scales from friendly sea creatures. Her most distinctive possession is an ancient staff carved from driftwood that she claims came from the first tree to ever touch the ocean, adorned with navigation instruments that blend magical and mundane techniques.

## Background

Driftwood has spent over two centuries studying the ocean's mysteries, beginning as a young elf fascinated by the patterns she observed in tidal pools. Her studies gradually expanded to encompass the entire oceanic system, leading her to develop her unique philosophy that treats the ocean as a living, conscious entity.

She earned her title "Sage" after successfully navigating a rescue mission through the Temporal Storms - oceanic disturbances where [[Time flows differently. Her ability to guide ships safely through impossible conditions established her reputation and led to her current role as Aquabyssos's premier navigator.

Throughout her career, she has trained dozens of navigators while conducting personal research into the deepest mysteries of oceanic consciousness and the spiritual aspects of sea travel.

## Current Activities

Driftwood is increasingly concerned about disturbances in the ocean's natural patterns that seem to correspond with the political unrest in Aquabyssos. She's been conducting extensive observations to determine whether the city's internal conflicts are affecting the surrounding oceanic environment or vice versa.

She's also been approached by various factions seeking her navigation services for sensitive missions, requiring her to carefully balance her neutral stance with her de[Sire]] to help maintain stability in the region.

## Quest Hooks

1. Driftwood offers to guide [[The Party to a location that can only be reached during specific oceanic conditions that occur rarely and unpredictably.
2. Strange disturbances in oceanic patterns suggest supernatural interference, and Driftwood needs investigators to help identify the source.
3. The party requires safe passage through dangerous waters, leading them to seek Driftwood's unique navigation expertise.
