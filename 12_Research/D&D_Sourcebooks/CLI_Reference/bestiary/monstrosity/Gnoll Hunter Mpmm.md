Hunters are the stealthiest gnolls in a war band. In the vanguard, they creep around, picking off isolated opposition while clearing the way for the rest of the force to advance.

Hunters are particularly skilled with the longbow, and they fire arrows with viciously barbed heads. Even when a hunter doesn't kill their target with their first shot, the arrow strike brings so much pain that the victim is hobbled in its attempt to run away.

## Gnolls

The first gnolls were hyenas transformed by magic. Many of them were then corrupted by the demon lord Yeenoghu. Whether in service to Yeenoghu or dedicated to the survival of their kin, gnoll war bands seek to soften up foes with surprise attacks and to leave no survivors alive.
