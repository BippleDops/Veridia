# Detect Magic
*1st-level, Divination (ritual)*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Sphere)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you sense the presence of magical effects within 30 feet of yourself. If you sense such effects, you can take the [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears the magic, and if an effect was created by a spell, you learn the spell's "school of magic".

The spell is blocked by 1 foot of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of metal; or a thin sheet of lead.

**Classes**: [Druid](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Warlock](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Ranger](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md); [Paladin](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md); [Sorcerer](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Cleric](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Wizard (Diviner)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-diviner-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard (College of Lore)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
