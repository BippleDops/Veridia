# Quest - The Perfect Purifier

**Level:** 7-10 | **Type:** Heist/Investigation | **Duration:** 3-5 sessions

## Quest Overview
Alchemist Master Theron Crystalline claims to have developed the Perfect Purifier - a device capable of cleansing any corruption, including the Crystal Plague. However, his laboratory was ransacked and the device stolen by unknown agents. The race is on to recover this potentially world-saving invention before it falls into the wrong hands.

## Quest Giver
**Master Theron Crystalline** - Brilliant but paranoid alchemist who dedicated his life to fighting corruption. Offers his entire fortune (15,000 gp) and rare alchemical formulas as reward for the device's safe return.

## Background
Theron spent decades studying various forms of magical corruption, developing increasingly sophisticated purification methods. His latest creation, the Perfect Purifier, represents the culmination of his life's work - a crystalline device that can allegedly neutralize any form of magical taint or disease.

## Initial Investigation
**Laboratory Crime Scene:**
- Sophisticated break-in with minimal damage
- Specific targeting of the Perfect Purifier
- Other valuable items left untouched
- Signs of magical detection and dispelling
- Hidden message from Theron warning of "the Consortium"

## The Consortium Connection
**The Purist Consortium** - Secret organization believing corruption serves a "natural selection" purpose. They view the Perfect Purifier as a threat to the cosmic order and seek to destroy it.

### Key Members
- **Lady Venetia Silkwind** - Public face and financial backer
- **Shadow Operative Kaine** - Mastermind of the theft
- **Dr. Mordecai Blight** - Researcher studying beneficial aspects of corruption
- **The Cleanser** - Assassin targeting purification researchers

## Investigation Leads
1. **Black Market Dealers** - Rumors of unusual alchemical equipment sales
2. **Rival Alchemists** - Professional jealousy and academic disputes
3. **Corruption Victims** - Desperate individuals seeking the device
4. **Government Agents** - Official interest in controlling the technology
5. **Religious Orders** - Theological debates about purification morality

## The Device's Trail
**Phase 1:** Underground auction in the Merchant Quarter
**Phase 2:** Transport via secret tunnel network
**Phase 3:** Hidden facility in abandoned temple ruins
**Phase 4:** Final confrontation at Consortium stronghold

## Major Encounters
1. **Auction House Infiltration** (Social/Stealth) - Gathering intelligence
2. **Tunnel Chase Sequence** (Action) - Pursuing the device
3. **Corrupted Guardian** (Combat CR 8) - Temple ruins defender
4. **Consortium Strike Team** (Combat CR 9) - Elite operatives
5. **The Cleanser Assassin** (Combat CR 7) - Personal vendetta

## Moral Complications
**The Device's True Nature:** The Perfect Purifier doesn't just cleanse corruption - it removes ALL magical energy, potentially devastating magical ecosystems and creatures.

**Ethical Dilemmas:**
- Should such powerful technology exist?
- Who has the right to decide what constitutes "corruption"?
- Could the device be used as a weapon against magical beings?
- Is some corruption actually beneficial or necessary?

## Multiple Resolutions
**Recovery Route:** Return device to Theron for completion and controlled use
**Destruction Route:** Destroy the device to prevent misuse
**Consortium Route:** Join the Consortium in studying corruption's benefits
**Government Route:** Turn device over to official authorities
**Modification Route:** Alter the device for limited, safer applications

## Consequences Based on Choice
**Recovery:** Theron begins careful purification work, but attracts more enemies
**Destruction:** Corruption continues spreading, but dangerous technology eliminated
**Consortium:** Gain access to corruption research, but become complicit in suffering
**Government:** Device becomes political tool with unknown consequences
**Modification:** Compromise solution with both benefits and limitations

## Rewards and Punishments
**Base Reward:** 15,000 gp, rare alchemical components
**Bonus Rewards:** Potion of Supreme Healing, Ring of Protection, Theron's Research Notes
**Social Consequences:** Reputation changes based on final choice
**Long-term Impact:** Ongoing effects on Crystal Plague situation

## Recurring Antagonists
Consortium members may return as recurring villains, while Theron could become ongoing ally or dangerous obsessive depending on party actions.

## Expansion Opportunities
- Investigate other Consortium operations
- Deal with consequences of device usage
- Explore corruption's role in magical ecosystem
