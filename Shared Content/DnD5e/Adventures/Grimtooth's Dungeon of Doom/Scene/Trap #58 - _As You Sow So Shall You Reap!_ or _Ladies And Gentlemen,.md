# Trap #58 - "As You Sow So Shall You Reap!" or "Ladies And Gentlemen,
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The entire steel wall opposite the entry slowly sinks into the ground. This will reveal a room 20 feet deep and 40 feet wide. This is in reality an extension of the staff room, steel walls and all.
> 
> At the back of the room is a large, comfortable, throne like chair. The chair is resting on a low pedestal. In the air above the chair is a glowing crystal globe. The globe pulses with a brilliant red light It is this light that illuminates this portion of the room.
> 
> On the throne is a stumpy figure. It is clad in the almost comically familiar wizards robe, complete with sun, moon, and star symbols. The figure seems to be sleeping.
> 
> The gang of tomb robbers have it in their power all this time to attack the dozing figure, or the glowing sphere above it.
> 
> If the delvers attack they will seal their own fate. The globe will loose the energy stored from the deamons, and those who have tried to touch the staff. It will blast the remaining delvers with annihiliatory force (note not flame, but the primal force of disintigration.) and then go back to waiting for the next party.
> 
> Can't you see it now? The delvers have bashed, thrashed, and trashed their way into this wizardly prescence, and then blow the whole deal by acting just like delvers always do. "Look there he is George, it's Evinrood. Let's blow him up and see what happens." This is what is most likely to happen. Good old humanoid tomb trashers, they seldom let me down.
> 
> Yet it is just possible that they will exert some forebearance. If so, they will have a chance to witness the return from a form of magical hibernation of one crafty wizard.
> 
> Evinrood' s soul and the magical power it possessed would have been seized at the time of his death by the minnions of Selgolub. Keep in mind Evinrood had tried and failed to defeat the dearnon lord and his operatives before. So Evinrood knew he needed a plan or he was going to become a karmic power plant for the plans of conquest the Deamon Lord was fostering.
> 
> Evinrood constructed this entire network with the aid of the dwarves, who owed him quite a few favors, and his own elementals. The purpose of the tomb's trap network was to Lhwart the assassins, both human and deamonic, that would be sent to see just why his soul could not be taken. Then in the center of the complex he built a place he could go and notexactly- die. The steel room with his staff in place were set up to store power to bring his body back to life. The magic in the walls would keep his soul from escaping into the clutches of Selgolub. The globe stored the energy of Sttength and Intelligence until enough was available to enable Evinrood to return to normal.
> 
> What the party witnesses is a blinding flash of light from the globe. When the after images of the light have cleared Evinrood will be standing up.
> 
> At this point he will go into some maudlin diatribe about how nice everybody was to come in and help him out. This is after he checks to see of the two ladies in traps 50, and 52 are O.K. (If they aren't then see blast-of-magical force from above! See there is always hope. No foolish deed goes unpunished!)
> 
> The old wizard, has obviously gone soft in his old age, as at this point he will bestow on the remaining members of the party the globe. (Which has changed to ordinary iron and is about the size and weight of an 81b. shot) He tells the party that this device can act as a storehouse for any human attribute, but only one at a time. If it is not used for this it can be used to store up Lo 5 spells for a mage which can be cast simultaniously, or one at a time as well as the wizards own.
> 
> He will then tum to leave. Walking through the staff room, he stops to pull the staff out of the stone, and notices the little piles of ash. "Oh my, I knew I was forgetting something." And with a gesture all the delvers blasted will be restored! With another gesture, they are all teleported to the nearest village outside the trap complex. (After all this.just walking out would be anti-climactic.)
> 
> Now I know that most of you would just as soon see the delvers get their just desserts, but it seems that only nice old high-level wizards have the time to devote to trap science, at least in the old days. As a result this namby-pamby ending will have to do. But for those who have a real feeling for irony, just let yourself stop at the point where the doddering old psychotic blasts everyone and exits laughing. It is a sight to warm the cockles of a Trap Masters Heart.
> 
> That's it for now ...
