Unlike most creation myths that speak of gods bringing forth life from nothing, the tale of the Drowned God describes a divine sacrifice so profound that it fundamentally altered the nature of existence across both worlds. ### The Original Deity Before the great submergence that created [Aquabyssos]], the entity known as **Oceanus Prime** was a god of boundaries - the divine force responsible for maintaining the separation between different realms of existence. Neither benevolent nor malevolent, Oceanus Prime served as cosmic infrastructure, ensuring that the various layers of reality remained distinct and stable. Ancient texts describe Oceanus Prime as having no fixed form, appearing sometimes as vast crystalline structures, sometimes as geometric patterns of flowing energy, and sometimes as an absence of space that still somehow maintained presence and awareness. This deity required no worship and granted no boons - it simply existed to maintain cosmic order. ### The Cosmic Crisis

Millennia ago, reality faced a catastrophic threat: the barriers between dimensions were failing, allowing entities from beyond normal existence (now recognized as aspects of the [[Deep Mother) to begin infiltrating all worlds simultaneously. The cosmic order that Oceanus Prime maintained was collapsing under assault from forces that operated by fundamentally different rules of existence. ### The Divine Choice

Faced with the imminent destruction of all ordered reality, Oceanus Prime made an unprecedented decision. Rather than fight the cosmic invaders directly (which would have required abandoning its role as boundary-maintainer and thus accelerating reality's collapse), the deity chose to transform itself into a new form of barrier - one that could exist within the compromised reality rather than separate from it. ### The Drowning Transformation

Oceanus Prime deliberately "drowned" itself in the chaotic energies of the dimensional breach, allowing the alien forces to corrupt and transform its divine essence. This sacrifice created several unprecedented effects: - The deity's consciousness was fractured across multiple aspects, some remaining protective and some becoming hostile
- Its divine power became distributed throughout the waters of all worlds, creating "blessed drowning" that could either save or damn
- A new form of reality stabilization emerged - not separation of dimensions, but controlled integration
- The cosmic boundary between [Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos became permeable but stable, allowing limited interaction while preventing total merger ### The Protective Aspect

The part of Oceanus Prime that retained its original purpose became what surface dwellers call "The Drowned God" - a deity of necessary sacrifice and protective transformation. This aspect: - Guides souls through life-changing transitions that require "death" of old selves
- Grants power to those willing to sacrifice their terrestrial existence for aquatic adaptation
- Protects underwater civilizations from cosmic threats through controlled exposure to manageable amounts of chaos
- Maintains the dimensional barriers that keep both worlds stable during convergence events ### The Corrupted Aspect The portions of Oceanus Prime that were too deeply touched by alien influence became something darker - entities that whisper from the deepest trenches, offering power through submission to cosmic horror. This corrupted aspect: - Seeks to complete the "drowning" of all reality by merging it with extra-dimensional chaos

- Grants terrible knowledge and power to those who surrender their humanity entirely
- Works to weaken the barriers between worlds in ways that would benefit cosmic horror entities
- May be connected to the [Deep Mother]] manifestations that plague both realms ### The Neutral Waters

Most of the Drowned God's influence exists in a state between salvation and damnation - waters that transform rather than simply blessing or cursing. These neutral aspects: - Create environments where both beneficial and harmful changes are possible
- Test individuals through trials that can result in transcendence or destruction
- Serve as communication medium between the protective and corrupted aspects
- Allow for redemption of the corrupted and corruption of the pure with equal ease ### The Orthodox Religious View

*Temple doctrine from both worlds* The Drowned God is a benevolent deity who sacrificed its original nature to protect all reality from cosmic destruction. The apparent "corruption" and hostile aspects are either tests of faith or misinterpretations by those who lack proper spiritual preparation. Worship should focus on accepting necessary sacrifice and trusting in divine protection even when it appears threatening. ### The Academic Analysis

*Scholarly research and historical documentation* Oceanus Prime was likely a naturally occurring cosmic phenomenon - possibly a stable dimensional rift or reality-maintece mechanism - that was anthropomorphized into deity status by cultures trying to understand forces beyond their comprehension. The "sacrifice" was probably natural evolution of this phenomenon under stress from extra-dimensional intrusion. ### The Mystic Understanding

*Deep-current oracles and void-touched seers* The Drowned God exists in a state of eternal conflict with itself, simultaneously working to save and destroy reality. This isn't contradiction but necessity - true protection sometimes requires controlled destruction, just as healing sometimes requires cutting away infected tissue. Worshippers must be prepared to serve either aspect as cosmic circumstances demand. ### The Cosmic Horror Revelation

*Knowledge accessible only to those touched by alien truth* The Drowned God is a successful example of how cosmic horror entities integrate with local reality - not through conquest but through transformation of existing divine structures. What appears to be "sacrifice" was actually successful possession and conversion. The protective aspects are just more subtle forms of the same alien intelligence that manifests as the corrupted aspects. ### Sacred Sites

Locations throughout both worlds where the Drowned God's influence is strongest:
- **The Weeping Depths**: Underwater caverns where prayers echo in languages that predate human speech
- **Transformation Pools**: Surface springs that can grant aquatic adaptation at unknown cost
- **The Neutral Current**: A band of water that flows between worlds, serving as both passage and trial
- **Sacrifice Sanctuaries**: Temples where offerings must be made to maintain cosmic stability ### Divine Interventions

The Drowned God occasionally manifests directly:
- **Protective Drownings**: Individuals facing certain death underwater sometimes emerge with aquatic adaptations and altered loyalties
- **Wisdom Floods**: Sudden access to impossible knowledge, usually accompanied by partial transformation toward aquatic physiology
- **Convergence Visions**: Prophetic dreams showing potential futures for both worlds, with the understanding that preventing the worst outcomes requires personal sacrifice
- **Redemptive Submersions**: Opportunities for the corrupt to achieve purification through controlled exposure to beneficial drowning ### The Prophetic Cycle

Ancient texts suggest the Drowned God's sacrifice was not a single event but an ongoing process. As convergence between worlds accelerates, the deity faces the choice again: maintain current reality through continued self-sacrifice, or allow complete merger that might either save or damn both worlds. ## Mechanical Effects **Drowned God Blessing** (Divine Favor)

**Summary**: Mechanical Effects **Drowned God Blessing** (Divine Favor) - Key information at a glance.

Characters who earn the deity's favor may receive:
- Ability to survive underwater indefinitely
- Resistance to transformation effects (both beneficial and harmful)
- Access to divine knowledge about cosmic threats and dimensional stability
- Gradual physical adaptation toward aquatic existence (may be blessing or curse) **Sacred Drowning** (Ritual Effect)

Controlled exposure to the deity's power through ritual submersion:
- Allows major life transitions and character development arcs
- Can cure corruption from cosmic horror exposure
- May grant new abilities related to water and dimensional travel
- Always involves sacrifice of some aspect of character's original identity **Divine Conflict** (Environmental Effect)

In areas where the Drowned God's influence is strong:
- Magic related to water or transformation functions unpredictably
- Characters may receive conflicting divine guidance (protective vs. Corrupted aspects)
- Reality occasionally "glitches" as different aspects of divine will conflict
- Both salvation and damnation are possible from identical actions ### The Divine Schism

The protective and corrupted aspects of the Drowned God are moving toward open conflict, which could destabilize reality itself. The PCs must either prevent this divine civil war or choose which side deserves support. ### The Sacrifice Required

Prophecies suggest that preventing catastrophic convergence will require someone to undergo the same transformation as Oceanus Prime originally did. Who will make the ultimate sacrifice, and can they trust that it will actually help? ### The False God

Evidence surfaces that the entity worshipped as the Drowned God is actually an elaborate deception created by cosmic horror entities. But if the "false" god has been protecting both worlds for millennia, does the truth of its origin matter? ### The Redemption Quest

The PCs discover a way to potentially heal the Drowned God's fractured nature, restoring Oceanus Prime to its original form. But would this restoration help or harm both worlds, given how much reality has adapted to the current divine dysfunction? ### The Divine Awakening

The Drowned God begins manifesting more directly, offering clear guidance and power to those willing to serve its cause. But its actions seem to be preparing for something that will fundamentally change the nature of existence across both worlds. ### The Successor Crisis

The Drowned God's power is fading, and it seeks a mortal to inherit its role as boundary-maintainer between worlds. The PCs must decide whether to accept this divine burden, prevent anyone from taking it, or find an alternative solution to maintain cosmic stability. ## The Eternal Question The Drowned God embodies the fundamental question of whether protective sacrifice can ever truly be distinguished from destructive surrender. Is the deity a heroic protector that gave up its original nature to save reality, or a cautionary tale about how even divine beings can be corrupted by the very forces they attempt to fight? The answer may determine whether the approaching convergence represents an opportunity for transcendence or a trap leading to cosmic horror dominion. *"In drowning, we learn to breathe new truths. In breathing new truths, we discover what parts of ourselves were always meant to drown."* - Inscription at the First Temple of Sacred Depths ## Player-Facing Summary The Drowned God is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Drowned God as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Drowned God. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A letter reveals the truth about this place
