## Description
This [[Wand|wand]] has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice: 1d6+1` (1d6+1) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

***Command.*** While holding the [[Wand|wand]], you can use an action to expend 1 charge and command another creature to flee or grovel, as with the **[[Command|command]]** spell (save [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15).

***Cone of Fear.*** While holding the [[Wand|wand]], you can use an action to expend 2 charges, causing the wand’s tip to emit a 60-foot [[2 - Casting a Spell|cone]] of amber [[9 - The Environment|light]]. Each creature in the cone must succeed on a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15 [[Wisdom|Wisdom]] saving throw or become [[Frightened|frightened]] of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take [[12 - The Order of Combat|reactions]]. For its action, it can use only the [[14 - Actions in Combat|Dash]] action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
