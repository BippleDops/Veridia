# Shandaril's Tracer (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *divination*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
You place an invisible rune on a single inanimate object. Thereafter, you can concentrate for a minute and learn direction and distance to that object, even if it’s on another plane; you can also tell if the object is handled by another creature. If the rune is dispelled or the item is destroyed, you will be instantly alerted.

The rune will be revealed if a *detect magic* or *true seeing* spell is cast on the item. If this happens, you will be instantly alerted. Finally, an object with this spell on it acts as an “associated object” for purposes of teleporta-tion.
