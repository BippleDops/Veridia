| 3 | A maze of barrels, crates, or similar obstacles stands in your way. Make a DC 10 Dexterity or Intelligence saving throw (your choice) to navigate the maze. On a failed save, the maze counts as 10 feet of [[difficult terrain xphb|Difficult Terrain]] for you. |
| 4 | The ground is slippery with rain, spilled oil, or some other liquid. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, you have the [[conditions#prone|Prone]] condition. |
| 5 | You encounter a brawl in progress. Make a DC 15 Strength, Dexterity, or Charisma saving throw (your choice) to get past the brawlers unimpeded. On a failed save, you take `2d4` Bludgeoning damage, and the brawlers count as 10 feet of [[difficult terrain xphb|Difficult Terrain]] for you. |
| 6 | You must make a sharp turn to avoid colliding with something impassable. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to navigate the turn. On a failed save, you collide with something hard and take `d4` Bludgeoning damage. |
