# Gatekeeper Iron-Lung Boris

*"Every passage tells a story, every visitor brings change. I've watched a thousand tales unfold through these gates - some beautiful, some terrible, all necessary."*

## Overview

Gatekeeper Iron-Lung Boris controls one of the most important entry points into Aquabyssos's restricted zones, managing access to the Deep Engineering Sector where the city's most critical infrastructure is maintained. A veteran of the city's expansion period, Boris earned his nickname from the mechanical breathing apparatus he requires due to exposure to toxic gases during early construction projects.

Boris combines the duties of security guard, customs official, and informal intelligence gatherer, as his position allows him to observe who enters and exits the secured areas. His decades of experience have given him an uncanny ability to assess people's intentions and identify potential threats or valuable intelligence.

Despite his gruff exterior and mechanical breathing, Boris has become a beloved figure among the engineering community and serves as an unofficial mentor to younger workers.

## Appearance

Boris is a stocky dwarf in his sixties, with gray-streaked hair and beard that frame a face marked by years of exposure to industrial hazards. His most distinctive feature is the bronze and crystal breathing apparatus that covers his nose and mouth, connected to a small backpack unit that filters and processes air for his damaged lungs.

He wears a modified uniform that combines elements of engineering gear with official security insignia, complete with numerous pockets containing tools, keys, and documentation. His eyes are sharp and alert despite his mechanical breathing, missing nothing that happens in his domain.

## Personality
- Protective of the workers and infrastructure under his watch
- Surprisingly well-informed about city politics and technical matters
- Gruff exterior hiding genuine care for those he considers worthy
- Takes pride in maintaining security without being unnecessarily harsh

### Special Abilities
**Iron-Lung Apparatus.** Boris's breathing apparatus grants him immunity to inhaled toxins and advantage on Constitution saves against gas-based attacks.

**Gatekeeper's Authority.** Boris can activate magical security systems and has advantage on rolls to detect lies or hidden intentions from those seeking passage.

**Engineering Knowledge.** Boris has expertise with mechanical devices and can identify the purpose and function of technological items.

### Actions
**Multiattack.** Boris makes two attacks with his security baton or crossbow.

**Security Baton +1.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. On a critical hit, the target is stunned until the end of their next turn.

**Heavy Crossbow.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. *Hit:* 6 (1d10 + 1) piercing damage.

**Security Alert (1/day).** Boris can activate alarm systems that alert security forces and grant allies advantage on initiative rolls for the next minute.

**Lockdown Protocol (1/day).** Boris can seal security doors and activate barriers in a 60-foot radius, requiring DC 18 Strength or Thieves' Tools checks to bypass.

## Background

Boris arrived in Aquabyssos thirty-five years ago as a young dwarf engineer, working on the dangerous early construction projects that expanded the city into previously inaccessible areas. During a catastrophic gas leak incident, he saved dozens of workers but sustained permanent lung damage that requires his mechanical breathing apparatus.

Rather than retiring on disability, Boris requested assignment to security duties where his engineering knowledge would remain valuable. His position as gatekeeper has evolved over the decades from simple access control to intelligence gathering and threat assessment.

Boris has become an institution at his post, with three generations of workers having passed through his checkpoint and benefited from his guidance and protection.

## Current Activities

As political tensions rise, Boris has noticed increased attempts to access restricted areas by individuals with unclear motivations. He's been quietly documenting suspicious activities and coordinating with security forces to prevent potential sabotage of critical infrastructure.

He's also been mentoring a new generation of security personnel, passing on his expertise in identifying threats and maintaining the delicate balance between security and operational efficiency.

## Relationships
- **Engineering Corps**: Respected veteran and informal advisor
- **Security Forces**: Senior colleague and source of intelligence
- **Infrastructure Workers**: Protective guardian and mentor figure
- **All Factions**: Maintains professional neutrality while protecting critical systems

## Secrets
- Maintains detailed logs of all individuals who have accessed restricted areas over the past decade
- Has discovered evidence of systematic attempts to map the city's infrastructure
- Knows the locations of several emergency protocols that could secure or evacuate critical areas
- Has identified patterns suggesting coordinated intelligence gathering by unknown parties

## Quest Hooks
1. Boris approaches the party with evidence of infiltration attempts on critical infrastructure, needing discrete investigation.
2. The party requires access to restricted areas for their mission, leading to negotiations with Boris about security protocols.
3. An attempt to sabotage Boris's post suggests someone wants to compromise security at a crucial time.

## DM Notes
Boris serves as both a security resource and an information source about infrastructure and technical matters. His position makes him valuable for providing access to restricted areas while his experience offers insights into the city's industrial and security operations. Use him to represent the dedicated civil servants who keep the city functioning regardless of political upheavals.
