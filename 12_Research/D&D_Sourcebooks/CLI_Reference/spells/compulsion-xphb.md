# Compulsion
*4th-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each creature of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] condition until the spell ends.

For the duration, you can take a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] to designate a direction that is horizontal to you. Each [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] target must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that direction on its next turn, taking the safest route. After moving in this way, a target repeats the save, ending the spell on itself on a success.

**Classes**: [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-glory-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Paladin (Oath of Glory)]]
