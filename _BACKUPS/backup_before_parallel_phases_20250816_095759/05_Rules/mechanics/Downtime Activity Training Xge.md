*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 134* Given enough free time and the services of an instructor, a character can learn a language or pick up proficiency with a tool. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Resources Receiving training in a language or tool typically takes at least ten workweeks, but this time is reduced by a number of workweeks equal to the character's Intelligence modifier (an Intelligence penalty doesn't increase the time needed). Training costs 25 gp per workweek. ## Complications Complications that arise while training typically involve the teacher. Every ten workweeks spent in training brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Training Complications table. ## Player-Facing Summary Downtime activity training xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
