## Timeline Validation Rules

### Date Consistency
1. All PD dates count backwards from Convergence Day
2. All AE dates count forward from Day 1 post-Convergence
3. Character ages must align with birth dates and historical events
4. Event durations cannot exceed logical timeframes

### Causal Chain Requirements
1. Preparation events must precede outcomes by sufficient time
2. Information spread follows realistic communication speeds
3. Population changes follow logical demographic patterns
4. Technology development requires adequate research time

### Cross-Reference Standards
1. All character birth dates must align with their described ages
2. Institution founding dates must precede character involvement
3. Cultural changes require generational timeframes
4. Political events must follow logical succession
