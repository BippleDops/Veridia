--- # Crystal Bloom

*Living Crystal Growth Transformation* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Crystal Bloom begins when magical crystals take root in living flesh, slowly converting organic matter into living gemstone. The transformation grants increasing durability and magical resoce at the cost of flexibility and humanity. ## Stage I: Awakening (1-10 TP)

*Small crystal growths appear at injury sites* ## Stage II: Manifestation (11-20 TP)

*Crystal patches spread across body* ## Stage III: Evolution (21-30 TP)

*Half the body becomes living crystal* ## Stage IV: Metamorphosis (31-40 TP)

*Mostly crystal with traces of original form* ## Stage V: Transcendence (41+ TP)

*Pure living crystal entity* ## Adventure Hooks

1. A crystal bloom outbreak threatens a mining town
2. Ancient crystal gardens hold transformed ancestors
3. A cure exists in the heart of a living crystal cave
4. Crystal beings seek to transform a entire city
5. The party must negotiate with transcended crystal entities --- *"Beauty eternal, humanity forgotten. The crystal song calls, and flesh answers."* ## Player-Facing Summary Crystal Bloom is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Crystal Bloom as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Crystal Bloom. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Shadow Alliance - Control trade routes ## Plot Hooks - Strange dreams suggest ancient magic
