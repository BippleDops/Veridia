# Investment of the Chain Master
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 156*  

**Prerequisite**: Level 5 Warlock

When you cast [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/find-familiar-xphb|Find Familiar]], you infuse the summoned familiar with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the following benefits.

## Aerial or Aquatic

The familiar gains either a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/fly-speed-xphb|Fly Speed]] or a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/swim-speed-xphb|Swim Speed]] (your choice) of 40 feet.

## Quick Attack

As a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]], you can command the familiar to take the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Attack|Attack]] action.

## Necrotic or Radiant Damage

Whenever the familiar deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can make it deal Necrotic or Radiant damage instead.

## Your Save DC

If the familiar forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC.

## Resistance

When the familiar takes damage, you can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb|Reaction]] to grant it [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/resistance-xphb|Resistance]] against that damage.
