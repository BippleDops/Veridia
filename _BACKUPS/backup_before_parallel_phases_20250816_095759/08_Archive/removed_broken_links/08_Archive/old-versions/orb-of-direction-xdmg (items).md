--- # Orb of Direction

*Wondrous item, common* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/orb-of-direction.webp#right) - **Weight**: 3.0 lbs. This orb can be used as an Arcane Focus. While holding this orb, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic action to determine which way is magnetic north. Nothing happens if the orb is used in a location that has no magnetic north. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 283* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Orb of direction xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.

Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around orb of direction xdmg. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology.
