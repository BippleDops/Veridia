# Observatory
*Level 13 Bastion facility*  

- **Prerequisites**: Ability to use a [Spellcasting Focus](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/spellcasting-focus-xphb.md)
- **Space**: Roomy (16 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 1
- **Order**: empower

Situated atop your Bastion, your Observatory contains a telescope aimed at the night sky.

## Observatory Charm

You can use your Observatory to peer into the far corners of "Wildspace" and the "Astral Plane". After spending a Long Rest in your Observatory, you gain a magical [Charm](/03_Mechanics/CLI/rewards/observatory-charm-xdmg.md) (see ""Supernatural Gifts"" in "chapter 3") that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast [Contact Other Plane](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/contact-other-plane-xphb.md) without expending a spell slot. You can't gain this Charm again while you still have it.

## Empower: Eldritch Discovery

When you issue the "Empower" order to this facility, you enable yourself or the facility's hireling to explore the eldritch mysteries of the stars for 7 consecutive nights. At the end of that time, roll a die. If the number rolled is even, nothing is gained. If the number rolled is odd, an unknown power bestows one of the following Charms on you or another creature of your choice that is on the same plane of existence as you: "Charm of Darkvision", "Charm of Heroism", or "Charm of Vitality" (all described in "chapter 3").

## Player-Facing Summary

Observatory is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of observatory as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around observatory.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties observatory to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at observatory to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to observatory active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
