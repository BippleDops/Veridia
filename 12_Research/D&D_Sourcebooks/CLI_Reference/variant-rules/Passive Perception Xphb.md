--- # Passive Perception

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 372. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* Passive Perception is a score that reflects a creature's general awareness of its surroundings. The DM uses this score when determining whether a creature notices something without consciously making a Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) check. A creature's Passive Perception equals 10 plus the creature's Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) check bonus. If the creature has [[Advantage Xphb]] on such checks, increase the score by 5. If the creature has [[Advantage Xphb]] on them, decrease the score by 5. For example, a level 1 character with a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception has a Passive Perception of 14 (`10 + 2 + 2`). If that character has [[Advantage Xphb]] on Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) checks, the score becomes 19 (`10 + 2 + 2 + 5`). ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Passive perception xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.

Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around passive perception xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
