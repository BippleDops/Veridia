## Plot Hooks and Adventure Opportunities

### The Vanishing Collection
**Level**: 4-8
Several of the Antiquarium's most valuable artifacts have begun disappearing, seemingly vanishing from their secured display cases. Investigation reveals the items are being drawn back to their original locations by some powerful force, potentially endangering both the collection and the city.

### The Cursed Commission
**Level**: 6-10
A wealthy collector commissions the Antiquarium to acquire a specific artifact rumored to grant great power. However, the item's location is protected by ancient guardians, and its removal could disturb the balance between surface and sea civilizations.

### The Temporal Smuggler
**Level**: 5-9
Artifacts from the future are appearing on the black market, suggesting someone has found a way to harvest items from temporal currents. The party must trace the source and prevent disruption of the natural flow of time through the oceans.

### The Atlantean Conspiracy
**Level**: 7-12
Evidence surfaces that suggests the lost city of Atlantis wasn't destroyed but deliberately hidden, and that someone is using the Antiquarium's collection to locate its current position. The party must determine whether this discovery represents opportunity or threat.

### The Deep Madness
**Level**: 8-14
Scholars who study certain artifacts from the deepest parts of the ocean are developing a form of madness that grants them disturbing insights into otherworldly truths. The party must investigate whether this is contamination, curse, or unwilling enlightenment.

### The Diplomatic Incident
**Level**: 3-7
An underwater civilization claims that several artifacts in the Antiquarium's collection are sacred relics that were stolen from them. Diplomatic tensions rise as the party must navigate between legitimate ownership claims and international relations.

### The Shard Connection
**Level**: 9-15
Evidence emerges that one of the Seven Shards is hidden among the Antiquarium's collection, disguised as a lesser artifact. However, locating it attracts the attention of powerful entities seeking to gather all the Shards.

## Secrets and Hidden Elements

### The Living Collection
Some of the artifacts in the Antiquarium are not entirely inanimate—they retain fragments of consciousness from their original owners or the civilizations that created them. Eliza carefully manages these semi-sentient items, using their knowledge while preventing them from exerting unwanted influence.

### The Deep Sea Trading Network
The Antiquarium serves as a hub for a secret network of traders who deal directly with current underwater civilizations. This network allows for the acquisition of contemporary items from societies that officially don't exist according to surface records.

### The Temporal Anchor
Hidden beneath the main building is an ancient device that helps stabilize the temporal currents in the region, preventing artifacts from different time periods from creating paradoxes when brought together in one location.

### The Extinction Archive
A sealed vault contains the last remaining artifacts from underwater civilizations that have been completely destroyed. These items represent irreplaceable windows into lost cultures, but some carry curses or diseases that contributed to their creators' destruction.

### The Prophet's Collection
Among the future artifacts are items that belonged to members of the current party, suggesting their future adventures will have significant impact on oceanic history. Eliza carefully guards this knowledge to avoid creating paradoxes.

### The Shard Research Project
Eliza has been secretly researching the Seven Shards for years, using her collection to trace their historical movements and effects on oceanic civilizations. Her findings could be crucial to understanding their ultimate purpose.
