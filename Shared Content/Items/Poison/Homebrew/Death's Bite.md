# Death's Bite
## Overview
Start with Wyrmtongue Petals like all poisons, and grind in the root part of some Arctic Creeper. Then add some Spineflower Berries and Quicksilver Lichen. This [[Poisoned|poison]] has a Alchemy Attempt DC of 18. The resulting mixture should look like a translucent [[Light|light]] grey liquid with lines of silver flakes from the lichen. When used appropriately, the target it is used on becomes [[Poisoned|poisoned]] for 30 seconds, and takes `dice: 2d6` + Alchemy Modifier necrotic damage per round.
