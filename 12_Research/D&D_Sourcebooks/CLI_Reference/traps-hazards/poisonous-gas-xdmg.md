# Poisonous Gas
*Generic Hazard*  

Poisonous gas is usually encountered in an enclosed space, such as a sewer or sealed tomb. The gas fills as much space as it can, up to a maximum of ten 10-foot [[cube-area-of-effect-xphb|Cubes]]. The transparent gas carries a foul odor. The gas is continuously or periodically replenished by some natural or magical source, though a strong wind disperses the gas for 1 minute.

Any creature that enters poisonous gas for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (`d10`) Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures in the gas also have [[disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on [[death-saving-throw-xphb|Death Saving Throws]].
