# Horn of the Endless Maze

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** Rare

## Description

You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Abyss appear within 60 feet of you. These spirits look like minotaurs, and use the [[berserker]] statistics. They return to Abyss after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

The horn summons `dice: 3d4+3` berserkers. To use the horn, you must be proficient with all simple weapons.

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.
