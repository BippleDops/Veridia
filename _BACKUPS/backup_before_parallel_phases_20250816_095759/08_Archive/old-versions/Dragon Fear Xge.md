--- # Dragon Fear

*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 74* **Prerequisite**: [[dragonborn-xphb (races) When angered, you radiate menace. You gain the following benefits: - Increase your Strength, Constitution, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20. - Instead of exhaling destructive energy, you can expend a use of your Breath Weapon trait to roar, forcing each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you to make a Wisdom saving throw (**DC 8** + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier). A target automatically succeeds on the save if it can't hear or see you. On a failed save, a target becomes [conditions#frightened|frightened]] of you for 1 minute. If the [[conditions#frightened|frightened target takes any damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Dragon fear xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
