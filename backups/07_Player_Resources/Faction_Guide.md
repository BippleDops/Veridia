# Complete Faction Guide
*Navigate the Treacherous Waters of Politics*

## Understanding Faction Politics

### The Web of Alliances
No faction exists in isolation. Each organization maintains complex relationships with others, creating a web of alliances, rivalries, and uneasy truces that shift like ocean currents. Your actions for one faction ripple outward, affecting your standing with all others.

### Standing System Explained
Your relationship with each faction is measured from -5 to +5:

| Standing | Status | Benefits | Drawbacks |
|----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| -5 to -4 | Enemy | None | Kill on sight, bounty on head |
| -3 to -2 | Hostile | None | Barred from territory, watched |
| -1 to 0 | Neutral | Basic services | No special treatment |
| +1 to +2 | Friendly | Discounts, information | Minor obligations |
| +3 to +4 | Allied | Safe houses, resources | Major obligations |
| +5 | Inner Circle | Faction secrets, leadership access | Life belongs to faction |
