## Special Traits
**Ghost Flames:** Every creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of a kurok-spirit must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw or take 2 (`dice: 1d4`) necrotic damage. The creature's maximum number of hit points is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage, and the kurok-spirit gains the same number of temporary hit points.

**Incorporeal:** A kurok-spirit can move through solid objects and other creatures as if they were difficult terrain. The kurok-spirit takes 5 (`dice: 1d10`) force damage if it is still inside something solid at the end of its turn.

**Soul Eater:** A creature slain by a kurok-spirit can't be raised from the dead; its soul was devoured by the kurok-spirit and no longer exists.

## Actions
**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (`dice: 1d8`) necrotic damage and the target must make a successful DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or take 6 (`dice: 1d6+3`) psychic damage.
