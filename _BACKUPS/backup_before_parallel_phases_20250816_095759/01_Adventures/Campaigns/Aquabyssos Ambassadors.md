*Bridges Between Two Worlds* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview The Aquabyssos Ambassadors represent one of the most challenging diplomatic corps in either realm, tasked with maintaining relations between the underwater civilization of [[Aquabyssos and the surface world of [Aethermoor|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]. These skilled diplomats must navigate not only political complexities but also the literal challenges of operating in two drastically different environments. Led by the experienced [[Ambassador Korvin Blacktide|02 Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Korvin Blacktide, the Ambassador Corps serves as the primary interface between [Parliament of Echoes|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Parliament Of Echoes]] and surface governments. Their work ranges from negotiating trade agreements to preventing wars, all while managing the deep cultural misunderstandings that arise between civilizations separated by [[The Great Drowning|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Drowning.
