## Description
Served to emperors in the courts of Shou Lung, this unusual fruit is not available in the West. I offer this rare fruit in two forms; dried, so that it is not dissimilar to Imnescarian dates, and preserved in syrup, so the fruit retains all its tender sweetness. (50 gp/lb dried; 10 gp/pt. preserved)
