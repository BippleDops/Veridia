[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]], a city where crystal spires reach toward the heavens and aether-powered technology lights every street.

[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]. Unlike approaches that seek to dominate or eliminate one reality in favor of another, healing practitioners believe that both worlds can be restored to wholeness while maintaining their unique characteristics. This discipline combines advanced magical theory, consciousness manipulation, and profound spiritual understanding to address the fundamental trauma that fractured reality during [[The Great Crystallization]] and [[Timeline of the Drowning]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] while belonging fully to neither. Created and operated by [[The Liminal Trading Company]]

[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor Archives]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]], built upon the ruins of the God-King Aetheron's empire 500 years ago. Currently led by [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]], centered in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven]] and led by [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]. They champion the controlled use of Aether Crystals for the betterment of society while maintaining order through the [[Crystal Wardens]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]], controlling the majority of crystal trade, banking, and increasingly, political power through debt manipulation. Founded 200 years ago by dragon-blooded merchants, the Consortium has evolved from a trading guild into a shadow government that rivals [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Crown]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]], controlling the production, distribution, and sale of the finest silks, enchanted fabrics, and magical textiles throughout the realm. Under the leadership of Lady Venetia Silkwind, the Guild has evolved from a traditional artisan cooperative into a sophisticated commercial empire that influences fashion, politics, and economic policy across both Aethermoor and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]], forming the continent's primary maritime frontier and its most prosperous trading region. Named for the distinctive blue-tinted waters created by underwater crystal formations, this 400-mile coastline serves as the main interface between the surface world and the underwater realm of [[Aquabyssos]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] for twelve years, ascending to the throne after her father's mysterious death. Beautiful, intelligent, and politically savvy, she has championed the advancement of crystal technology while trying to maintain peace between the [[Crystal Wardens]] and the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Purist Coalition]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] has been transformed from a magnificent seat of royal power into something both beautiful and terrifying—a crystalline cathedral where [[The Queen|Queen Seraphina]]'s possessed consciousness communes with [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]], its crystalline spires reaching toward the heavens like prayers made manifest. Built from rare [[Illumination Crystals]] that glow with perpetual divine radiance, the Cathedral serves as the spiritual heart of the realm and the primary seat of the [[Sacred Order of Luminous Dawn]]. Here, [[High Luminary Celestine Brightward]]

[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s largest trading hub, where ships from across the world dock to trade in Aether Crystals and exotic goods. The city is ruled not by nobles but by the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Merchant Princes]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s military might—an elite force of warriors who have undergone crystal enhancement to serve as [[The Queen|Queen Seraphina]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s most famous explorer before his expedition vanished in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Crystalline Wastes]] two months ago. Secretly funded by [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s most notorious information broker, operating through a network of bardic colleges, taverns, and noble courts. No one knows their true identity—they appear differently to each person, always behind an ornate crystal mask that shifts colors with their mood. Their voice can shatter crystal or mend hearts, and they claim to know every secret worth knowing in both Aethermoor and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s most powerful and dangerous criminal organization, built around exploiting the growing [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Shadow Corruption]] that seeps through crystal networks. Named after their enigmatic leader [[Vex Shadowthorn the Kingpin]], this syndicate controls illegal activities across multiple floating cities, specializing in corrupted crystal trafficking, shadow-magic services, and exploiting the chaos caused by unstable [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s most powerful criminal organization, dealing in corrupted crystals, blackmail, and forbidden knowledge. Under [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s most significant foreign partners and potential threats - a maritime commercial empire built on trade networks, financial manipulation, and technological innovation. Located across the eastern ocean from [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Azure Coast]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] society. This year's 500th anniversary festival promises to be spectacular—but shadows gather beneath the celebration. [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s premier interdimensional marketplace, specializing in goods and services that exist in the liminal spaces between realities. Part commercial enterprise, part secret society, the Bazaar facilitates trade in shadow-touched items, memories, identities, and experiences that cannot be found in conventional markets. They bridge the gap between [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s recorded history, fundamentally reshaping the political, technological, and magical landscape of the entire continent. What began as a succession dispute in the ancient Kingdom of Drakmoor escalated into a nine-year struggle that drew in every major power, introduced revolutionary military technologies, and ultimately established the modern balance of power between [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven]], [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Ironhold]], [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]], and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Sylvanheart]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s stability—a network of aristocrats and court officials who have been corrupted by crystal possession, serving as unwitting agents of [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]]'s will while maintaining their positions of authority. Unlike [[The Queen|Queen Seraphina]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]], stands as one of the most tragic and dangerous figures in the realm's current crisis. Once beloved for her wisdom, compassion, and masterful command of crystal magic, she has become something far more sinister—a vessel for the ancient consciousness that dwells within [[The Seven Shards]]. Her transformation represents not just personal tragedy, but a fundamental threat to Aethermoor's survival as [[The Convergence Point]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s traditional institutions while advancing the divine agenda for [[The Convergence Point]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]. Their coordinated act of treachery - the attempted theft of [[The Crown of Stars]] - directly caused [[The Great Crystallization]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]], the largest remaining area untouched by crystal corruption. Protected by [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Archdruid Thornweaver]] and the [[Verdant Accord]], these ancient woods represent the world as it was before [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Crystallization]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] town whose crystal networks had been corrupted was healed through innovative techniques combining traditional crystal magic with [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] with the shadow energies of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Ancient Tunnels Beneath Palace]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]], and the mysterious [[Tenebrarum]] to negotiate the groundbreaking [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/The Depth Accords]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]. According to ancient [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Aboleth Prime Yoth]] memories and the teachings of [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Drowned Prophets]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] - a massive floating fortress built within the eye of a perpetual magical storm. Home to [[Storm Empress Tempestas Maelstrom]] and the seat of [[The Tempest Sovereignty]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] - an area where reality itself becomes unstable, constantly shifting between different states of existence. Sometimes the water is there, sometimes it isn't. Sometimes gravity works normally, other times it flows sideways or upward. The area appears to be the result of dimensional tears caused by [[The Great Drowning]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] and [[The Hadal Depths]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], appearing as pools of absolute darkness from which emerge the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]. As shadow corruption spreads throughout the realm and [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Shadow Conspiracy]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]. Built within and around a massive living blood coral formation known as the **Crimson Heart**, this fortress serves as both the operational nerve center of the syndicate's vast criminal empire and a testament to the raw power wielded by [[Coral Empress Scarletina]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] has grown from therapeutic necessity to widespread social phenomenon, but this technological advancement comes with severe unintended consequences. What began as medical treatment for [[Timeline of the Drowning]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], having ruled from [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Deepmind]] for over twelve millennia. As the true power behind the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Parliament of Echoes]], Yoth orchestrates the shadow corruption spreading through the underwater realm. They possess perfect racial memory stretching back to before the gods walked the realms, making them one of the few beings who remembers the time before [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Deep Mother]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], having undergone extreme depth adaptation that allows her to survive at any pressure. What makes her unique—and dangerous—is her conscious partnership with her shadow, regularly switching control of their shared body. She's one of the few beings who maintains independence from both the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Shadow Conspiracy]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], leading an elite unit of enforcers who patrol the deepest, most dangerous districts where regular authorities fear to tread. A hybrid born from human-sahuagin union during the early days of the submersion, he possesses the best traits of both species: human intelligence and adaptability combined with sahuagin predatory instincts and natural aquatic abilities. His relentless pursuit of criminals, especially [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Jasper "Three-Eyes" Flint]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], marking an individual's full acceptance and integration into aquatic society. More than a simple coming-of-age ritual, it represents the spiritual and physical transformation that connects each citizen to [[The Deep Mother]]'s embrace and the collective consciousness of the depths. The ceremony has evolved from the original survival adaptations during [[Timeline of the Drowning]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]. More shadow than flesh after years of bonding with umbral entities, she trades in the most dangerous commodity of all: secrets. Unlike [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Jasper "Three-Eyes" Flint]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]. Neither fully elemental nor entirely humanoid, Zephyr exists as a conscious manifestation of the ocean's currents themselves, given form and purpose during the Great Drowning. As head of the [[The Current Riders Guild]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]. Once the crown jewel of [[Scholar Emperor Thalassius the Wise]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]. Once the immortal god-emperor who ruled both Aquabyssos and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]. Operating from [[The Reflection Chamber]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], preaching that biological adaptation is the path to true harmony with the depths. Unlike those who resist the Drowning Embrace, Jasper celebrates transformation as evolution's gift. As the primary religious authority in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Abyssos Prime]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos Prime]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], serving as both police force and military organization responsible for maintaining order throughout the vast underwater realm. Founded over eight centuries ago during the consolidation of Aquabyssos under [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Emperor Thalassius the Wise]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]'s most powerful maritime empires. From its storm-wreathed halls, the Storm Empress commands the [[Stormcaller Navy]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]'s reality but remain accessible to [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]'s secret shadow legislature, functioning as a parallel government structure that mirrors and manipulates the conventional [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Parliament of Echoes]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]. Unlike a simple flood, this was a gradual, supernatural process spanning decades that fundamentally altered not just geography, but the very nature of reality, consciousness, and life itself. The event was both natural disaster and divine intervention, orchestrated by the stirring dreams of [[The Deep Mother]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], where specialized crystals essential to underwater civilization are cultivated, harvested, and processed for use in everything from [[Pressure Adaptation System]] components to [[Pressure Tubes]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], where water becomes something else entirely and the laws of physics surrender to older truths. Here, at depths exceeding 20,000 feet, the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Deep Mother]] slumbers in her eternal dream, her massive form comprising entire mountain ranges and trenches. This is where existence becomes negotiable, where pressure transforms matter into thought, and where even [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Aboleth Prime Yoth]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] with [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]
[[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] with shadow duplicates. Born from the phenomenon of shadows gaining independence 50 years ago, the conspiracy has infiltrated every level of society, from the [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Parliament of Echoes]]

[[Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos]] began weakening, Deep Mother Cult practices evolved to incorporate rituals designed to accelerate and guide the merging process. Modern cult ceremonies focus not just on individual transformation but on preparing entire communities for what they term "The Great Reunion" - a prophesied event where both worlds will be transformed into a single reality under the [[Deep Mother]]
[[Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos]], forming an intricate web of social rules, prohibitions, and collective behaviors designed to prevent, contain, and respond to crystal corruption incidents. These taboos emerged organically in the centuries following [[The Great Crystallization]]

[[Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos]] weaken, the Dream Shepherds face an unprecedented challenge. Dreams from both worlds are beginning to merge, creating hybrid nightmare-scapes where surface and underwater horrors combine. Worse, some individuals (like [[Marina's Echo]]

[[The Great Drowning]] not only failed spectacularly but may have actually caused the very catastrophe they sought to prevent. Located in the deep memorial district of [[Abyssos Prime]]
[[The Great Drowning]]. Stretching for hundreds of miles and plunging to unknown depths, its waters glow with an unnatural blue light - pure [[The Cerulean Breath]] in its most concentrated form.

[[The Hadal Depths]]. Early in his career, desperate for capital, he made agreements with things that should never be bargained with. Now, as his debts come due, he must find ways to pay prices that go far beyond money - potentially threatening not just his empire, but the safety of all [[Aquabyssos]]
[[The Hadal Depths]], something that predates even [[The Deep Mother]]
[[The Hadal Depths]] that could threaten all of [[Aquabyssos]]
[[The Hadal Depths]] that predates the Great Drowning. The entire fortress is actually a massive containment facility, and its real purpose is not to defend [[Aquabyssos]] from external threats, but to prevent something far worse from escaping into the world. [[Admiral Thorne Blackwater]]
