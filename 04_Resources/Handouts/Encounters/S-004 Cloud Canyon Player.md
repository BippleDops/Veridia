# Cloud Canyon

Towering walls of cloud open into a narrow corridor veined with lightning.

What you notice
- Static prickles across the deck
- Echoing thunder deeper in the canyon

What you can try
- Chart the twists
- Thread the needle
- Watch for ambushers in the lee

Possible outcomes
- You slip through like a whisper
- Lightning kisses the rails
- Raiders wait in the shadowed turns
