Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Crimson Fleet as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Crimson Fleet. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Accord - Manipulate succession ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Second Prophecy of Shadows ## Plot Hooks - A shipment has gone missing and evil awakens
