## Special Traits
**Aura of Evil:** A soul reaper constantly exudes a miasma of evil around itself. Any creature that begins its turn within 15 feet of a soul reaper takes 7 (`dice: 2d6`) necrotic damage. Creatures of evil alignment are immune to this effect.

**Inseparable Weapon:** If separated from its scythe, the soul reaper can summon the weapon back into its hands as a bonus action. If someone else is holding the weapon when the reaper summons it, that opponent and the soul reaper engage in a contest pitting the opponents Strength (Athletics) against the soul reapers Charisma (Intimidation). If the soul reaper wins the contest, the scythe returns to its hands and the opponent takes damage as if struck by the scythe. If the opponent wins the contest, it takes 14 (`dice: 2d8+5`) slashing damage.

**Soul Slash:** If a soul reaper scores a critical hit with its scythe, the target must make a successful DC 18 Constitution saving throw or its soul is torn from its body and into the soul reapers scythe, and the creature dies immediately. A victims soulless body collapses into a desiccated husk and crumbles to dust after 24 hours. To release a captured soul, the reaper must be destroyed and its scythe shattered on consecrated ground. When the scythe is shattered, all trapped souls are released. If a souls body hasnt crumbled into dust, the soul returns to the body and the body returns to life. Souls without a body are left to wander formlessly, but they can be returned to life through powerful magic (wish, true resurrection).

**Spell-like Abilities:** The soul reaper can use the following spell-like abilities, using Charisma as its casting ability (DC 18, attack +10). The soul reaper doesn’t need material components to use these abilities.

- At Will: *darkness, bane, inflict wounds*

- 1/Day: *contagion, hold person, insect plague*

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A soul reaper attacks three times with its scythe.

**Scythe +1:** *Melee Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (`dice: 2d8+5`) slashing damage plus 5 (`dice: 1d10`) necrotic damage. If this attack hits a creature with 0 hit points, the target dies instantly. The scythe scores a critical hit if the attack roll is a natural 19 or 20. A critical hit causes an additional 4 (`dice: 1d8`) slashing damage and 5 (`dice: 1d10`) necrotic damage, and see Soul Slash above.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
Soul reapers are vile undead with a fierce hatred for the living. They take great pleasure in slaying any living creature they encounter. They kill without guilt, without remorse, and without emotion, trapping the souls of their victims to insure they never return to life.

Soul reapers have no ties to the world of the living. Their origins are shrouded in unknowable antiquity, but scholars speculate that soul reapers stepped directly from the great void at the beginning of creation. It is believed that very few—perhaps only six or seven—of these creatures exist (and most living beings are thankful for that).

A soul reaper has a mystic connection to its scythe. Barring incredible circumstances, it can’t be separated from the weapon for more than a few seconds. Soul reapers are humanoid creatures shrouded in long, black, hooded cloaks, but standing 12 feet tall. Though they are corporeal, their form is either shrouded in utter darkness or formed of the stuff of shadows. They are not skeletal; no discernible facial features of any kind are visible under the hood. The creature’s “hands” are wicked claws of inky blackness that are always wrapped tightly around its gleaming scythe.

These creatures never speak; no one knows if they even can. If they could, what would one say to a soul reaper?

Soul reapers haunt civilized lands, searching for the next victim who will fall prey to the deadly, soul-drinking scythe. They have been known to attack lone travelers in remote areas, and to wade through towns or cities, reaping souls left and right. No one knows why a soul reaper appears in a certain area, or why it leaves.
