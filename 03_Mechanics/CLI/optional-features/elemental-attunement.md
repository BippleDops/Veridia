# Elemental Attunement
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 81*  

You can use your action to briefly control elemental forces within 30 feet of you, causing one of the following effects of your choice:

- Create a harmless, instantaneous sensory effect related to air, earth, fire, or water, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, a spray of light mist, or a gentle rumbling of stone.  
- Instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.  
- Chill or warm up to 1 pound of nonliving material for up to 1 hour.  
- Cause earth, fire, water, or mist that can fit within a 1-foot cube to shape itself into a crude form you designate for 1 minute.

## Player-Facing Summary

Elemental attunement is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of elemental attunement as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around elemental attunement.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties elemental attunement to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at elemental attunement to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to elemental attunement active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
