# Potion of Growth
*Potion, uncommon*  


- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, you gain the "enlarge" effect of the [[enlarge-reduce-xphb|Enlarge/Reduce]] spell for 10 minutes (no [[conditions#Concentration|Concentration]] required).

The red in the potion's liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
