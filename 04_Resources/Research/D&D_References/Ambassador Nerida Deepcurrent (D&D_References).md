The enigmatic envoy from the Tidal Courts of Aquabyssos, a vast underwater empire thought lost to legend.

> - Carries a Tide Pearl that can summon a tsunami once per year ## Embassy: The Cerulean Depths

Located in Crystalhaven's Embassy Quarter, her residence is a architectural marvel:
- Building partially flooded with breathable enchanted water
- Contains a portal pool to Aquabyssos (heavily guarded secret)
- Houses a growing collection of surface artifacts for study
- Basement connects to flooded tunnels beneath the city ## Plot Hooks

1. Hires party to retrieve a sunken relic from pre-drowning ruins
2. Requests escort to [[Port Meridian|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]] for "trade negotiations"
3. Offers valuable information about underwater passages in exchange for crystal samples
4. Needs discrete investigation of ships that have been exploring too deep ## DM Notes
