# Baba Yaga's Dancing Broom
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/baba-yagas-dancing-broom.webp#right)


The archfey "Baba Yaga" crafted many of these magic brooms. No two appear exactly alike. While holding the broom, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to transform it into an [[animated-broom-xmm|Animated Broom]] under your control. The broom then moves into an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The broom acts immediately after you on your [[initiative-xphb|Initiative]] count and remains animate until you take a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] and use a command word to render it inanimate.

On your turn, you can mentally command the animated broom if it is within 30 feet of you and you don't have the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] condition (no action required). You decide what action the broom takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.

If the broom is reduced to 0 [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]], it shatters and is destroyed. If the broom reverts to its inanimate form before losing all its [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] it regains all of them.
