## Description
A set of [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Bards' Emporium/Other Equipment/Puppets|puppets]] or marionettes can transform a single bard into an entire theatrical [[Stilts|STILTS]]: For bards who hope for higher occupations, we supply [[Stilts|stilts]] of all lengths. We offer both simple [[Stilts|stilts]] with [[Poles|poles]], handles that run behind the arms, and complex [[Stilts|stilts]] that strap to the calves. (Both are the same price.) Either type uses lighttroupe or transform an existing troupe into an army. We offer both [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Bards' Emporium/Other Equipment/Puppets|puppets]] and marionettes in the following character types: bard, crone, cutpurse, farmer, herdsman, king, maiden, mage, merchant, mother, nobleman, orc, peasant, priest, prince, princess, queen, skeleton, slave, and soldier (7 gp each). We also offer a magnificent dragon puppet made of silk from Shou Lung, and requiring three hands to operate (15 gp).
