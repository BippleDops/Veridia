# Merrenoloth

## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_

Any ship a merrenoloth is contracted to captain becomes the creature's lair. When fighting on the ship, the merrenoloth can invoke its ability to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the merrenoloth can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- The ship regains 22 (`4d10`) hit points.  
- A strong wind propels the ship, increasing its speed by 30 feet until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- The air within 60 feet of the ship is filled with howling wind. Until initiative count 20 on the next round, that area is difficult terrain, and when a Medium or smaller creature flies into that area or starts its turn flying there, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[conditions#Prone|prone]].  

## Regional effects

A merrenoloth imbues its vessel with powerful magic that creates one or more of the following effects:

- The ship doesn't sink even if its hull is breached.  
- The ship always stays on course to the destination the merrenoloth names.  
- Creatures the merrenoloth chooses to take on the ship aren't discomfited by wind or weather, though this effect doesn't protect against damage.  

If the merrenoloth dies, these effects fade over the course of `d6` hours.
