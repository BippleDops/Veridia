## Special Traits
**Blinding Sickness:** A creature infected with blinding sickness must make a DC 9 Con saving throw after completing each long rest. On a failure, the infected creature gains 1 level of exhaustion; on a success, it loses 1 level of exhaustion. The disease is cured when the creature has 0 levels of exhaustion, or through lesser restoration or comparable magic. The real danger from the disease, however, is blindness. When a creature reaches 3 levels of exhaustion caused by blinding sickness, or when it has taken 3 or more necrotic damage in less than 10 minutes from [[Familiar, Blindingcrow|blindingcrows]], the creature is permanently blinded. Greater restoration or comparable magic is needed to cure this blindness.

**Swarm:** The [[Familiar, Blindingcrow|blindingcrow]] swarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa. The swarm can move through an opening large enough for an individual [[Familiar, Blindingcrow|blindingcrow]]. The swarm never regains hit points or gains temporary hit points.

## Actions
**Melee Attack—Beaks:** +4 to hit (reach 0 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d6` piercing damage, and the creature must make a successful DC 9 Con saving throw or take 1 necrotic damage and contract blinding sickness (see below). Piercing damage is `dice: 1d6` if the swarm has half or fewer of its starting hit points.

## Description
**Environment**: Non-arctic land

**Organization**: Solitary or cluster (2-4)

A [[Familiar, Blindingcrow|blindingcrow]] swarm is a mass of such birds mobbing together to defend against a predator or some other individual that has sufficiently antagonized them, usually through approaching too near a roosting murder of the birds or with loud noises. Only when [[Familiar, Blindingcrow|blindingcrows]] mob something and form a swarm does the threat of blindness become really serious.

[[Familiar, Blindingcrow|Blindingcrow]] swarms have the same general characteristics and habitat of normal [[Familiar, Blindingcrow|blindingcrows]].
