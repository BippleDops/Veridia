--- # Mechanics Standardization Report

*Documentation of Changes Made to Unify Game Systems* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Executive Summary This report documents the comprehensive standardization of all game mechanics across the Aquabyssos and Aethermoor campaign settings. The standardization addressed significant inconsistencies in difficulty classes, currency systems, progression mechanics, and resource management that were identified across 50+ mechanics files. ### 1. Difficulty Class Inconsistencies **Problems Found**:

- Pressure saves ranged from **DC 10**-22 across different files
- Sanity saves varied between **DC 10**-25 with no clear progression
- Shadow control DCs were inconsistent (10-20 range)
- Environmental modifiers applied differently across systems **Solutions Implemented**:
- Unified DC progression: Easy (10), Moderate (13), Hard (16), Very Hard (20), Legendary (25)
- Standardized environmental modifiers: -2 to +10 based on conditions
- Consistent save DC formulas across all systems
- Clear guidelines for when to use each difficulty level ### 2. Currency & Resource System Conflicts **Problems Found**:

- Multiple currency values for same items across different files
- Inconsistent equipment costs and degradation rates
- Memory pearl values varied dramatically
- No clear conversion between different currency types **Solutions Implemented**:
- Established gold piece as base currency with clear conversion rates
- Standardized equipment degradation system with unified DCs
- Created comprehensive currency exchange table
- Balanced memory pearl economy with consistent pricing ### 3. Progression System Imbalances **Problems Found**:

- Adaptation Point rates varied between files (1 AP/hour vs 1 AP/day)
- Sanity recovery rates inconsistent
- Shadow autonomy progression unclear
- Level-based scaling not coordinated across systems **Solutions Implemented**:
- Unified AP gain rates tied to depth and exposure time
- Standardized sanity recovery based on character level
- Clear shadow autonomy progression with consistent triggers
- Balanced level-based scaling for all progression systems ### 4. Combat & Environmental Modifier Confusion **Problems Found**:

- Underwater combat rules varied between systems
- Pressure effects applied differently
- Environmental hazard frequency unclear
- Movement penalties inconsistent **Solutions Implemented**:
- Unified underwater combat rules with clear modifiers
- Standardized pressure effects across all depth zones
- Consistent environmental hazard system
- Clear movement penalty progression ### Pressure Adaptation System **Changes Made**:

- Standardized depth zones with consistent DCs
- Unified AP gain rates: 1 AP/week (surface) to 5 AP/hour (void)
- Consistent adaptation stages with clear benefits/drawbacks
- Balanced transformation thresholds **Impact**: Eliminates confusion about adaptation rates and ensures consistent character progression regardless of which mechanics file was referenced. ### Crystal Corruption Mechanics **Changes Made**:

- Standardized 10-level corruption progression
- Consistent corruption point sources and rates
- Unified treatment difficulty scaling
- Clear mechanical effects for each corruption level **Impact**: Players can now predict corruption progression and plan accordingly. DMs have clear guidelines for corruption advancement. ### Shadow Separation Rules **Changes Made**:

- 6-level autonomy progression with consistent DCs
- Clear triggers for shadow independence checks
- Standardized consequences for shadow separation
- Unified control mechanics across all situations **Impact**: Shadow mechanics now provide consistent challenge scaling and clear player decision points. ### Sanity & Madness Framework **Changes Made**:

- Unified sanity point calculation: 10 + WIS mod + level
- Standardized sanity loss categories with clear triggers
- Consistent madness thresholds and effects
- Balanced sanity recovery rates by character level **Impact**: Mental health mechanics now scale appropriately with character development and provide consistent horror experience. ### Memory Trading Economy **Changes Made**:

- Standardized memory pearl values by rarity and type
- Unified absorption limits and effects
- Consistent market pricing and availability
- Balanced memory crafting costs and requirements **Impact**: Memory economy now functions as reliable game system with clear value propositions and balanced risk/reward. ### Combat Systems **Changes Made**:

- Unified underwater combat modifiers
- Standardized movement penalties by adaptation level
- Consistent pressure effects on combat
- Balanced damage scaling across depth zones **Impact**: Combat encounters now have predictable mechanics regardless of environment or character adaptation level. ## Files Modified/Superseded The following files contained mechanics that are now superseded by the Unified Mechanics Guide: 1. **Complete_Pressure_Adaptation_System.md** - AP rates and DC progressions

2. **Depth Survival Mechanics.md** - Pressure save DCs and environmental effects
3. **Crystal Plague Mechanics.md** - Corruption progression rates
4. **Deep Mother Sanity System.md** - Sanity loss triggers and recovery
5. **Shadow Separation Mechanics.md** - Autonomy progression and control DCs
6. **Comprehensive Survival System.md** - Various DC inconsistencies
7. **Memory_Trading_Economy.md** - Currency values and absorption limits
8. **Underwater Combat Rules.md** - Combat modifiers and movement penalties ### For DMs

1. **Primary Reference**: Always consult Unified Mechanics Guide first
2. **Conversion**: Use provided conversion table for old DC references
3. **Consistency**: Apply environmental modifiers uniformly
4. **Scaling**: Use level-based guidelines for appropriate challenges ### For Players

1. **Character Building**: Use standardized progression rates for planning
2. **Resource Management**: Reference unified currency system for trades
3. **Risk Assessment**: Rely on consistent DC progressions for decision-making
4. **Adaptation Planning**: Use clear thresholds for character development ### Update Procedures

1. All new mechanics must reference Unified Mechanics Guide
2. Any conflicts must be resolved through formal standardization process
3. Changes to unified guide require documentation in this report
4. Player notification required for any mechanical changes ## Conclusion The standardization process successfully unified 50+ disparate mechanics files into a single, consistent system. The Unified Mechanics Guide now serves as the authoritative reference for all game mechanics, eliminating confusion and ensuring balanced, predictable gameplay. Key achievements:

- âœ… Eliminated DC inconsistencies across all systems
- âœ… Unified currency and resource management
- âœ… Balanced progression systems for appropriate challenge scaling
- âœ… Standardized environmental effects and modifiers
- âœ… Created clear guidelines for future mechanical additions This standardization maintains the unique horror and wonder of both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor while providing the mechanical consistency necessary for smooth gameplay and fair challenge progression. --- ## Appendix: Quick Conversion Table For reference when using older mechanics files: | Old DC Range | New Standard DC | Difficulty Level |
