# Marlos Urnrayle

## Lair actions
_Source: Princes of the Apocalypse_

If Marlos is in the earth node while [Ogr√©moch](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/npc/ogremoch-pota.md) isn't, the medusa can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Marlos uses a lair action to cast [earthquake](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/earthquake-xphb.md) without using components. As long as he maintains [concentration](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Concentration) on [earthquake](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/earthquake-xphb.md), initiative count 20 is the start of Marlos's turn for the purpose of the spell. He can take no other lair actions while [concentrating](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Concentration) on [earthquake](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/earthquake-xphb.md).

Marlos's second option for a lair action is to draw power from the earth node to heal. When he does so, he regains 30 (`6d8 + 3`) hit points.
