# Sleep of Ages Trap
## Overview
*Simple trap (level 11â€“16, deadly threat)*
When a sleep of ages trap activates, a pressure plate unleashes a spell that threatens to send intruders into a deep slumber. The dungeon's guardians can then more easily dispose of the sleepers.

### Trigger.
Stepping on the pressure plate triggers this trap.

### Effect.
When activated, this trap casts a sleep spell centered on the pressure plate, using a 9th-level spell slot.

### Countermeasures.
A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the pressure plate. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check made within 5 feet of the pressure plate disables the trap, and a check with a total of 10 or lower triggers it. A successful dispel magic (DC 19) cast on the pressure plate destroys the trap.
