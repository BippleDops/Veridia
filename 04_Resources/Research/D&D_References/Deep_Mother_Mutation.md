Deep Mother Mutation represents the most dangerous form of transformation in both [[Aquabyssos]] and [[Aethermoor]]. Exposure to the [[Deep Mother]]'s influence causes rapid and profound changes to both mind and body, transforming victims into servants of an incomprehensible cosmic entity.

*Deep Mother mutations appear to be part of a larger pattern of cosmic infection spreading across multiple realities. The entity's ultimate goals remain unclear, but evidence suggests it seeks to transform entire planes of existence into extensions of its own consciousness.* *Latest studies indicate that strong emotional connections and divine protection provide the best defense against initial infection. However, no known cure exists for Stage 4 transformation.* *All research materials require special containment to prevent accidental exposure. Researchers must undergo daily screening and work in teams with reality anchors and divine protection.* --- **Warning**: This transformation represents an existential threat to player agency and campaign stability. Use sparingly and always provide hope for recovery or prevention until the final stage. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*
