# Horseshoes of Speed
*Wondrous item, rare*  



These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a horseshoe also takes a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action.

While all four horseshoes are attached to the same creature, its [[speed-xphb|Speed]] is increased by 30 feet.
