# Hibernation (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (fur from a creature that hibernates)

**Duration**: 1 month


## Effects
You touch a Large-sized creature, two Medium-sized creatures, or three Small or Tiny creatures, who go into hibernation for a week. If the creature is unwilling, it may make a Constitution saving throw to resist. While hibernating, the creatureâ€™s need for food, water, and oxygen is reduced by a fac-tor of 10. The creature can be awakened for a brief time but will go back to sleep once it is no longer needed. At the end of the duration, the creature will wake up very hungry and thirsty. If you are not the one in hibernation, you may use your action to dismiss the spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd-level or higher, the creature sleeps for an additional month for each slot level above 4th.
