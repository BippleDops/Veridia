# Robe of Scintillating Colors
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  



This robe has 3 charges, and it regains `d3` expended charges daily at dawn. While you wear it, you can take a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action and expend 1 charge to cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until the end of your next turn. During this time, the robe sheds [Bright Light](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) in a 30-foot radius and [Dim Light](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 30 feet, and creatures that can see you have [Disadvantage](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on attack rolls against you. Any creature in the [Bright Light](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) that can see you when the robe's power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [Stunned](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Stunned) condition until the effect ends.
