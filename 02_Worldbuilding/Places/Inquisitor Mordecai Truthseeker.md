# Inquisitor Mordecai Truthseeker

*"Truth is like the deepest currents - it will find its way to the surface, no matter how many lies try to bury it in the depths."*

## Overview

Inquisitor Mordecai Truthseeker is a feared and respected investigator within the Church of the Tidal Throne, specializing in rooting out corruption, heresy, and deception within both religious and secular institutions. His methods are thorough and uncompromising, earning him both admirers and enemies throughout Aquabyssos.

Truthseeker operates with the full authority of the Church, conducting investigations that often span months or years. His reputation for uncovering hidden truths has made him invaluable during times of political upheaval, though his rigid adherence to justice sometimes puts him at odds with those who prefer diplomatic solutions.

Currently, he's investigating reports of heretical practices and possible infiltration of corruption within the city's various factions, making him a dangerous wild card in the current political climate.

## Appearance

Mordecai is a stern-faced human in his early forties, with prematurely gray hair cropped short in military fashion. His eyes are steel blue and seem to pierce through any attempts at deception. He wears the deep blue robes of his office, adorned with silver symbols of the Tidal Throne and a medallion that glows faintly when detecting lies.

His bearing is that of a soldier-priest, moving with purpose and authority. Scars on his hands and forearms hint at past conflicts, while his weathered face speaks to years spent in harsh underwater environments pursuing the guilty.

## Background

Mordecai was born on the surface but called to serve the depths when visions of the Tidal Throne began haunting his dreams at age sixteen. He joined the Church as a novice and quickly distinguished himself through his unwavering dedication to truth and justice.

He earned his title "Truthseeker" after a legendary investigation that exposed a conspiracy of corrupted priests who were secretly serving abyssal entities. This investigation took him three years to complete and resulted in the purification of an entire monastery.

For the past decade, he has served as the Church's primary investigator for serious matters, developing a network of informants and a reputation for incorruptibility that extends throughout the underwater realm.

## Current Activities

Mordecai is currently investigating reports of unusual corruption affecting various faction leaders in Aquabyssos. He's noticed patterns suggesting external supernatural influence, possibly connected to the recent increase in political tensions.

He's been conducting discrete interviews with witnesses and examining evidence of possible heretical practices. His investigation has led him to suspect that something far more dangerous than simple political ambition is driving the current crisis.

## Relationships
- **Church of the Tidal Throne**: Senior investigator and trusted agent
- **High Inquisitor**: Direct superior who provides him with missions
- **Various Faction Leaders**: Subjects of investigation (unknown to them)
- **Sister Morwyn**: Colleague who provides insight into spiritual matters
- **City Guard**: Professional relationship for evidence gathering

## Secrets
- Has evidence suggesting abyssal influence in the city's political structure
- Maintains a hidden network of reformed criminals who serve as informants
- Discovered ancient texts suggesting the corruption has appeared in Aquabyssos before
- Suspects that some of his own Church superiors may be compromised

## Quest Hooks
1. Mordecai approaches the party for assistance with his investigation, needing people outside the official power structure to gather evidence.
2. The party becomes subjects of his investigation due to their activities, requiring them to prove their innocence or face Church justice.
3. Mordecai needs protection while pursuing a dangerous lead that has already resulted in attempts on his life.

## DM Notes
Mordecai serves as both a potential ally and threat to player characters. His commitment to truth means he can provide valuable information, but also that he won't hesitate to investigate the party if they give him cause. Use him to add moral complexity to situations and to represent the consequences of players' actions catching up with them.
