# Chariot of Sustarre (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *8th-level*

**School**: *conjuration*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of wood, two holly berries, and a burning torch)

**Duration**: 12 hours


## Effects
You summon a chariot pulled by two great horses, all of which is alight with ele-mental fire; the chariot appears in a clap of thunder and cloud of smoke.

You and up to seven allies may ride in the chariot. All creatures other than yourself who are not immune to fire take 1d8 fire damage each round they end while in the chariot, or are within 5 feet of the chariot, unless they are physically touching you. A successful Dexterity saving throw will halve the damage they take from this.

The chariot can move on the ground with a speed of 50, or fly with a speed of 100. You control the chariot through verbal com-mands.

The chariot and horses are physical ob-jects. The horses have the same attributes as war horses (*Monster Manual,* p.340), save that they have AC 16, are immune to fire, light-ning, and radiant damage, vulnerable to cold, take 1 point of cold damage for every gallon of water splashed on them or for eve-ry 5 feet they must move through in water, and each of their attacks does an additional 2d6 fire damage. The chariot has AC 16 and 50 hit points, and has the same immunities and vulnerabilities as the horses. If the chari-ot or the horses are reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends.
