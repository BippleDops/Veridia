## Description

This [[staff]] can be wielded as a magic [[quarterstaff]] that grants a +2 bonus to [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] and damage rolls made with it. While you hold it, you gain a +2 bonus to [[2 - Casting a Spell|spell attack]] rolls.

The [[staff]] has 50 charges for the following properties. It regains `dice: 4d6+2` (4d6+2) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 20, the staff regains `dice: 1d12+1` (1d12+1) charges.

***Spell Absorption.*** While holding the [[staff]], you have [[2 - Advantage and Disadvantage|advantage]] on [[6 - Saving Throws|saving throws]] against spells. In addition, you can use your [[12 - The Order of Combat|reaction]] when another creature casts a spell that targets only you. If you do, the staff absorbs the magic of the spell, canceling its effect and gaining a number of charges equal to the absorbed spell’s level. However, if doing so brings the staff’s total number of charges above 50, the staff explodes as if you activated its retributive strike (see below).

***Spells.*** While holding the [[staff]], you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] and [[7 - Spellcasting|spellcasting]] ability: **[[conjure elemental]]** (7 charges), **[[dispel magic]]** (3 charges), **[[fireball]]** (7th-level version, 7 charges), **[[flaming sphere]]** (2 charges), **[[ice storm]]** (4 charges), **[[invisibility]]** (2 charges), **[[knock]]** (2 charges), **[[lightning bolt]]** (7th-level version, 7 charges), **[[passwall]]** (5 charges), **[[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Spells/PHB Spells/Plane Shift (D&D 5e SRD)|plane shift]]** (7 charges), **[[telekinesis]]** (5 charges), **[[wall of fire]]** (4 charges), or **[[web]]** (2 charges).

You can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the [[staff]] without using any charges: **[[arcane lock]]**, **[[Detect Magic|Detect Magic]]**, **[[Enlarge_Reduce|enlarge/reduce]]**, **[[light]]**, **[[mage hand]]**, or **[[protection from evil and good]]**.

***Retributive Strike.*** You can use an action to break the [[staff]] over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius [[2 - Casting a Spell|sphere]] centered on it.

You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take [[17 - Damage and Healing|force]] damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the [[staff]]. Every other creature in the area must make a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 17 [[Dexterity]] saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

| **Distance from Origin** | **Damage**                             |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 10 ft. away or closer    | 8 × the number of charges in the staff |
| 11 to 20 ft. away        | 6 × the number of charges in the staff |
| 21 to 30 ft. away        | 4 × the number of charges in the staff |

**Versatile**. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
