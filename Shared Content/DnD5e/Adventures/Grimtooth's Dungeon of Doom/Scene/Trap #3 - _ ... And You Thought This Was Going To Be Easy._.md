# Trap #3 - " ... And You Thought This Was Going To Be Easy."
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The coffin itself is carved so deep that a cursory examination will not reveal the trap that it contains. The coffin is 9 feet long, 4 feet wide and 4 feet high. It is topped by a heavy stone lid that must be lifted tO'gain entrance to the coffin. It is also enchanted with a high level (Ll3) spell that negates certain types of magic. Prolonged experimentation will show the negated spells to be spells of detection, and that it has a radius of 5 feet in all directions from the coffin.
> 
> Within the coffin there is a concealed blade, 2 feet up from the base of the pedestal. The blade is concealed by the intricate carving on the sides. The blade is 3 and 1/2 feet long and pinned in the center of the coffin on an axle. It is spring loaded so that when the lid is lifted it will swing free through an arc if unimpeded by a very stout object. (Hint: a leg, neck, arm or fleshy what have you will not even slow it down. Armour, if it is of less than excellent quality may be insufficient. (An indestructible wizard's staff, or very stout sword blade would be fine brakes for our little slicer.)
> 
> What the party hears as the blade swings through it's arc back into the opposite side of it's grove is a "click". This is what makes this trap so appealing: inside the coffin is another spring set to go off again if the lid is lifted.
> 
> The chief failing of this trap is that it only attacks the front of the coffin. A human should receive severe cuts to his legs while a dwarf might be beheaded! Assess hits and damage accordingly, keeping in mind you will want to know where every one is standing, and how tall they are.
> 
> Inside the sarcophagus are the springs for launching the blade, and a suitable collection of dust.
> 
> (To some this dungeon will seem to lack treasure but a canny delving party with brains bigger than walnuts will recognize various articles as having significant value. [[1 - The Entrance|The entrance]] trap yielded the elfish rope and several pounds of copper, while the coffin will yield the party a very serviceable sword blade, and two stout springs, items that are both difficult and expensive to manufacture in any quasimedieval world. If they can't broker these to a smith or wizard on their journeys they aren't half trying. Keep an eye out for other "intrinsic" treasures, and keep in mind if the party doesn't pick up on them it is their loss!)

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> **One last note:** on the surface of the coffin facing the wall opposite [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] is a small irregularity in the patterns. This irregularity when pressed will open the double doors concealed behind the stucco on this wall. The deviation in pattern will require a dedicated search to detect Keep in mind that these doors cannot be revealed magically due to the magic on the coffin which inhibits spells of detection. 
> 
> At this point the party will be left with a room that seemingly has no exits. Spells of detection on the walls co the right or left will reveal the presence of doors behind the stucco and frescos. Obviously acts of random violence will also reveal the presence of stonework behind the plaster so they can be detected manually by chipping off the stucco.

[[cjmke2cs.yag.png|I'd rate this trap at two skulls; one for the second swing of the blade unless the party is cripplingly stupid!]]
