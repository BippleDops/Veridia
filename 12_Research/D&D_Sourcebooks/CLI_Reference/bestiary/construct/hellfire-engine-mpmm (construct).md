Hellfire engines are semiautonomous bringers of destruction. Amnizus (in this book) and other devilish generals hold them in reserve until they are needed to repel an incursion by demons or crusading mortals, but occasionally one of these magical-mechanical hybrids gets loose, driven berserk by its need to destroy.

Hellfire engines take many forms, but all of them have one purpose: to mow down foes in waves. They are incapable of subtlety or trickery, but their destructive capability is immense.

Mortal creatures slain by hellfire engines are doomed to join the infernal legions in mere hours unless powerful magic-wielders intervene on their behalf. The archdukes of the Nine Hells would like nothing better than to modify this magic so it works against demons, too, but that discovery has eluded them so far.

      \ hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus\
      \ 22 (5d8) lightning damage. Up to three other creatures of the hellfire engine's\

      \ Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) lightning damage on a failed save,\
      \ or half as much damage on a successful one.  \n- 5–6 Thunder Cannon. The\

      \ creature within 30 feet of that point must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw,\
      \ taking 27 (5d10) bludgeoning damage plus 19 (3d12) thunder damage on a failed\
      \ save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  \n\n    If the chosen option\
      \ kills a creature, the creature's soul rises from the River Styx as a [[lemure xmm|lemure]]\
      \ in Avernus in d4 hours. If the creature isn't revived before then, only a\

      \ and casting true resurrection on the creature's original body can restore\
      \ it to life. Constructs and devils are immune to this effect.  "
