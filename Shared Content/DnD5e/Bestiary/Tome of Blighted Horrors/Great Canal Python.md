## Overview
### Great Canal Python
![[rhckngbs.wge.png|Great Canal Python|300]]
[[rhckngbs.wge.png|open outside]]

*A serpentine behemoth glides silently through the still water. Large fishing hooks protrude from its hide where they have snagged in past attempts to capture the creature, and the jagged blade of a broken harpoon is embedded in one side of its jaw.*

## Special Traits
**Lockjaw:** Every creature that took slashing damage from the python must make a DC 13 Con saving throw at the end of their next long rest after the combat. If the saving throw fails, the creature contracts lockjaw from the rusty harpoon blade embedded through the python’s jaw. An affected creature is unable to speak until the disease is cured with lesser restoration or comparable magic.

## Actions
**Melee Attack—Bite:** +8 to hit (reach 10 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d6 + 5` piercing damage.

**Melee Attack—Constrict:** +8 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d8 + 5` bludgeoning damage plus `dice: 3d6` slashing damage, and the creature is grappled (escape DC 15) and restrained. A grappled creature takes `dice: 2d8 + 5` ludgeoning plus `dice: 3d6` slashing damage at the start of the python’s turn. The python can constrict only one creature at a time. Creatures that take slashing damage may contract Lockjaw (see below).

## Description
**Environment**: Urban waterway (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary

This amazing specimen of serpentkind was brought at considerable risk and expense all the way from the Razor Coast for a Castorhage menagerie, only to promptly break free from its inadequate containment and escape into the murky water of the Great Canal. Already a beast of incredible strength and endurance, its years spent among the deadly denizens of the city’s water has honed it into a truly apex predator. It spends most of its time sleeping in the shallows of the canal during the day, looking like nothing more than the normal detritus that lines the canal bottom. At night it swims silently just beneath the surface in search of prey — whether it be some creature of the canal itself or some boatman or dockworker unlucky enough to have caught its attention. The massive serpent feeds nightly, so there are always disappearances near the water that can likely be attributed it, and the occasional finding of a massive molted skin beneath a dock or in a canal-side alley keeps the presence of the creature fresh on everyone’s mind. Many fishermen, hunters, and guardsmen have died in attempts to destroy the creature when it has been spotted, and its thickly gnarled hide bears many scars and marks of these hunts. So far, however, it has always proven to be the superior hunter in these contests.

The city of Castorhage has offered a 10,000-gp reward if this beast is captured or killed.
