# Saltmarsh Harbor - Cross-Realm Trading Port

## Cordelia Integration
Saltmarsh exists as a unique surface port city built directly above an Aquabyssos trading district. The harbor serves both surface vessels and submarines, making it a crucial hub for cross-realm commerce and smuggling.

## Physical Description
### Surface Level (Aethermoor Access)
- Traditional harbor with docks and warehouses
- Sky-ship mooring masts for aerial vessels
- Lighthouse equipped with crystal navigation beacons

### Underwater Level (Aquabyssos Access)  
- Submersible docks with pressure equalization chambers
- Crystal-powered air recycling systems
- Underwater warehouses with magical preservation

## Key Locations
- **The Wicker Goat Inn**: Multi-level establishment serving both realms
- **Harbor Authority**: Cross-realm customs and trade regulation
- **Smuggler's Tunnels**: Hidden passages between surface and depth
- **Crystal Processing Plant**: Illegal modification of water crystals

## Notable NPCs
- **Captain Marina Saltwind**: Harbor master managing dual-realm traffic
- **Sanbalet Wavecrest**: Aquabyssos smuggler leader
- **Ned Timberwright**: Surface dockworker union representative

## Current Conflicts
- **Shadow Conspiracy Influence**: Corrupted harbor officials facilitate illegal trades
- **Pressure Regulation Disputes**: Surface/depth jurisdiction conflicts
- **Crystal Smuggling**: Modified water crystals destabilize local ecosystems
- **Faction Tensions**: [[Silverscale Consortium]] vs local merchant guilds

## Adventure Hooks
- Investigate mysterious shipments arriving at odd hours
- Stop smuggling operation moving shadow-touched artifacts
- Negotiate trade dispute between surface and depth merchants
- Uncover shadow conspiracy cell using harbor for operations

## Environmental Challenges
- **Tidal Pressure Changes**: Regular shifts affect both levels
- **Crystal Interference**: High concentration disrupts magic
- **Weather Variance**: Surface storms affect underwater districts
- **Corruption Spread**: Shadow influence seeps through trade goods
