# Lightning Bolt
*3rd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (100-foot Line)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of fur and a crystal rod)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A stroke of lightning forming a 100-foot-long, 5-foot-wide [Line](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/line-area-of-effect-xphb.md) blasts out from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the [Line](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/line-area-of-effect-xphb.md) makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `8d6` Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d6` for each spell slot level above 3.

**Classes**: [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Druid (Circle of the Land)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-circle-of-the-land-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard (Evoker)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-evoker-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Druid (Circle of the Sea)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-circle-of-the-sea-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard (College of Lore)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
