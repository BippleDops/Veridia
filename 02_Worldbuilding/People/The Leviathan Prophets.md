## Overview
The Leviathan Prophets are a mysterious cult devoted to ancient sea creatures of immense power, believing these beings hold the keys to Aquabyssos's ultimate destiny. They interpret the movements of deep-sea leviathans as divine messages, predicting everything from political upheavals to natural disasters. Operating from hidden shrines throughout the city's deepest districts, they maintain that only through communion with these ancient entities can the city achieve true greatness.

Founded after the Great Stirring, when massive creatures were spotted in the deepest trenches, the Prophets claim direct spiritual connection to beings older than civilization itself. They view themselves as interpreters of an ancient covet between the leviathans and the underwater realm.
