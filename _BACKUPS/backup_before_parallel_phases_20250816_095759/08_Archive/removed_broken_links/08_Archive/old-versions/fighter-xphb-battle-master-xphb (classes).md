The most accomplished Battle Masters are well-rounded figures who combine their carefully honed combat skills with academic study in the fields of history, theory, and the arts. ### Combat Superiority (Level 3) Your experience on the battlefield has refined your fighting techniques. You learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called Superiority Dice. #### Maneuvers You learn three maneuvers of your choice from the "Maneuvers Options^[[list-optfeaturetype-mv-b (lists)]]; defined in Player's Handbook (2024)]" section later in this subclass's description. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack. You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice when you reach Fighter levels 7, 10, and 15. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one. #### Superiority Dice You have four Superiority Dice, which are d8s (`d8`). A Superiority Die is expended when you use it. You regain all expended Superiority Dice when you finish a [[short-rest-xphb or [long-rest-xphb]]. You gain an additional Superiority Die when you reach Fighter levels 7 (five dice total) and 15 (six dice total). #### Saving Throws If a maneuver requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) and [[Proficiency Xphb. ### Student of War (Level 3) You gain proficiency with one type of [artisans-tools-xphb (items)]] of your choice, and you gain proficiency in one skill of your choice from the skills available to Fighters at level 1. ### Maneuver Options (Level 3) The maneuvers are presented here in alphabetical order. ### Know Your Enemy (Level 7) As a [[Action Xphb, you can discern certain strengths and weaknesses of a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself; you know whether that creature has any Immunities, Resistances, or Vulnerabilities, and if the creature has any, you know what they are. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a [long-rest-xphb]]. You can also restore a use of the feature by expending one Superiority Die (no action required). ### Improved Combat Superiority (Level 10) Your Superiority Die becomes a`d10`. ### Relentless (Level 15) Once per turn, when you use a maneuver, you can roll`d8`and use the number rolled instead of expending a Superiority Die. ### Ultimate Combat Superiority (Level 18) Your Superiority Die becomes a`d12`. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Optional Features > [!example]- Optional Features: Maneuver, Battle Master
