## Special Traits
***Fearsome Presence.*** Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to any eladrin's Fearsome Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Fey Step (Recharge 4-6).*** As a bonus action, the eladrin can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

***Magic Resistance.*** The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The eladrin makes two weapon attacks.

***Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 ( `dice: 2d8+4`) slashing damage plus 4 ( `dice: 1d8`) fire damage, or 15 ( `dice: 2d10+4`) slashing damage plus 4 ( `dice: 1d8`) fire damage if used with two hands.

***Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 14 ( `dice: 2d8+5`) piercing damage plus 4 ( `dice: 1d8`) fire damage.

## Reactions
***Parry.*** The eladrin adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the eladrin must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

## Description
When they are angered, eladrin enter the season of summer, a burning, tempestuous state that transforms them into aggressive warriors eager to vent their wrath. Their magic responds to their fury and amplifies their fighting ability, which helps them move with astonishing quickness and strike with terrible force.
