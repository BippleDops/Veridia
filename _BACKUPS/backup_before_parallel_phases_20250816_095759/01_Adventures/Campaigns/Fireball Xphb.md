Each creature in a 20-foot-radius [[Area of Effect Xphb centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking``dice: 8d6``Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried start [burning-xphb (traps-hazards)]]. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by`d6`for each spell slot level above 3. **Classes**: [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [List Spells Classes Light Domain Xphb]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 274.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of fireball xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around fireball xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[Master_Spell_Compendium
