![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/talisman-of-the-sphere.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

While holding or wearing this talisman, you have [Advantage](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on any Intelligence ([Arcana](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Arcana)) check you make to control a [Sphere of Annihilation](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/sphere-of-annihilation-xdmg.md). In addition, when you start your turn in control of a [Sphere of Annihilation](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/sphere-of-annihilation-xdmg.md), you can take a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to move it 10 feet plus a number of additional feet equal to 10 times your Intelligence modifier. This movement doesn't have to be in a straight line.
