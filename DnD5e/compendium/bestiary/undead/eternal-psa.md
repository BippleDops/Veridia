## Description

**The Curse of Wandering.** The Curse of Wandering is the greatest danger of the desert lands. A creature killed in the desert rises again as a [zombie](/compendium/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) as soon as the moisture has dried from its flesh. As a result, the corpses of every kind of desert creature shamble across the dunes alongside the humanoid [zombies](/compendium/bestiary/undead/zombie.md) of [dissenters](/compendium/backgrounds/dissenter-psa.md) and would-be explorers. Most of these former humanoids are mindless marauders, though some tales speak of [mummies](/compendium/bestiary/undead/amonkhet-mummy-psa.md) that have retained a sinister intelligence and even magical ability, becoming [mummy lords](/compendium/bestiary/undead/amonkhet-mummy-lord-psa.md).

**The Anointed.** Not every citizen of Naktamun proves to be worthy of the afterlife. Acolytes sometimes die before the Ceremony of Measurement, perhaps in training accidents. Many [initiates](/compendium/backgrounds/initiate-psa.md) perish in one of the first four trials, before earning their five cartouches. [Viziers](/compendium/backgrounds/vizier-psa.md) sometimes die before they have truly earned a place in the afterlife serving their gods. Without having proven themselves worthy, these poor souls have no place as Eternals in the afterlifeâ€”but neither have they committed a grievous sin that would warrant abandoning them to the Curse of Wandering as marauding [mummies](/compendium/bestiary/undead/amonkhet-mummy-psa.md).

Fortunately, the beneficence of the God-Pharaoh is great enough to provide a role for these people. Called the [anointed](/compendium/bestiary/undead/anointed-psa.md), they are carefully embalmed, protected from the Curse of Wandering, and allowed to spend another lifetime in service to the worthy. The God-Pharaoh promises that those who faithfully serve as the [anointed](/compendium/bestiary/undead/anointed-psa.md) will earn a place as attendants in the afterlife as well, and even an eternity of service in the afterlife is preferable to an eternity subjected to the Curse of Wandering.

The bodies of the anointed are carefully wrapped in cloth and adorned with cartouches. In contrast to the cartouches of [initiates](/compendium/backgrounds/initiate-psa.md) and [viziers](/compendium/backgrounds/vizier-psa.md), these do not harbor the life essence of the deceased at their best. Instead, they coach the [anointed](/compendium/bestiary/undead/anointed-psa.md) for a particular form of service. With their cartouches in place, the [anointed](/compendium/bestiary/undead/anointed-psa.md) rise and join the ranks of serving mummies who attend to the needs of daily life in Amonkhet.

**An Eternal Army.** A being as mighty and magnificent as Nicol Bolas demands a fighting force of the highest caliber, so that an ordinary army of zombies could never be worthy of the God-Pharaoh. The Eternals are elite soldiers with all the skill and prowess of living soldiers, but none of the disadvantages that arise in living beings, such as emotions, hesitation, or disloyalty. Bolas has personally crafted all of Amonkhet to create just such an army.
