## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The tyrannosaurus makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. It can't make both attacks against the same target.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 33 (`dice: 4d12+7`) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the tyrannosaurus can't bite another target.

***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (`dice: 3d8+7`) bludgeoning damage.

## Description
This enormous predator terrorizes all other creatures in its territory. Despite its size and weight, a tyrannosaurus is a swift runner. It chases anything it thinks it can eat, and there are few creatures it won't try to devour whole. While prowling for substantial prey, a tyrannosaurus subsists on carrion, and on any smaller creatures that try to dart in to steal its meal.
