--- ## 🔧 [[Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### [Connection Improvements]] - Add cross-references to related notes ### [[Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Act 2 Begins - Journey to Tenebrarum > *"[In Tenebrarum]], your shadow isn't cast by you—you're cast by it."* ## 🎬 [[Strong Start

The party boards the [Dream Rails]] to Tenebrarum, but mid-journey, the train stops in a nightmare. They're in a surgical theater where shadows are being transplanted into paralyzed surface dwellers. One victim locks eyes with a party member—it's someone from their backstory, pleading silently for help as their shadow is peeled away like skin. ### Scene 1: [[The Dream [Rail Horror]]

**Location**: [[Nightmare Transit between continents **Situation**: Train stuck in collective surgical nightmare **Conflict**: Must restart the dream engine while avoiding nightmare surgeons **Discoveries**:
- The nightmare is actually a memory from last week
- [Dream Rails]] are powered by traumatic experiences - Someone's been redirecting trains into specific nightmares
- [[Marina-Red-Tide-Coralheart shadow has been sending messages ahead **[Skill Challenges]]**:
- **Investigation **DC 15****: Find the dream anchor holding train
- **Arcana **DC 16****: Restart the dream engine
- **Performance **DC 14****: Maintain composure in nightmare ### Scene 2: [[Tenebrarum Border - [The Shadow]] Checkpoint

**Location**: Entry to [[Tenebrarum - [The Penumbral]] Gates **Situation**: All visitors must register their shadows **Conflict**: Party's shadows are flagged as "persons of interest" **Discoveries**:
- Shadows are considered separate legal entities here
- A shadow court has issued warrants for the party
- [[[Shadow Duchess Nyx]] has immunity but won't extend it
- The checkpoint has holding cells full of separated shadows **[[Roleplay Challenge**:
- Negotiate with shadows directly
- Each PC's shadow has different demands
- Shadows know things PCs don't remember ### Scene 3: [The Umbral]] Exchange

**Location**: [[[The Shadow Markets]] - [[Central Trading Floor **Situation**: Infiltrate the shadow auction **Conflict**: Party's shadows are put up for bidding **Discoveries**:
- Child shadows being illegally harvested
- [[[The Silhouette]] [[Surgeon Prime]] run a shadow breeding program
- Shadows can be modified like genetics
- Someone's been buying all shadows from [[[Abyssos Prime]] **Combat/Heist**:
- **Option A**: Steal back shadows (stealth mission)
- **Option B**: Win shadows at auction (resource management)
- **Option C**: Expose illegal operations (social combat) ### Scene 4: [[The Surgeon's Invitation

**Location**: Private surgical suite **Situation**: [Head Surgeon]] offers a "deal" **Conflict**: Trade information for shadow modifications **Discoveries**:
- Surgeons aren't human anymore—they're living shadows wearing flesh
- The procedure would make party immune to harvest
- Cost: Must deliver someone else for harvest
- Marina's been here before, has surgical scars **[[Moral Choice**:
- Accept modifications (become part shadow)
- Refuse and fight (combat encounter)
- Negotiate alternative (skill challenge) ## 🔍 Secrets & Clues

1. [The Shadow]] Harvest has already begun in minor settlements
2. [[[Shadow Duchess Nyx]] is hunting her original shadow
3. The surgeons have been creating hybrid beings for years
4. [[Marina-Red-Tide-Coralheart shadow is actually the original Marina
5. The [Parliament of Echoes]] has a shadow duplicate parliament
6. Someone in the party has been marked for priority harvest
7. The [[[Fear Farms]] are producing weapons-grade nightmares
8. [[Crystallium is broadcasting shadow control frequencies
9. [The Dream]] Rails connect to [[Memoriam but nobody remembers
10. The next [Memory Tide]] will carry shadow transformation virus ## 🎪 [[Cliffhanger Ending

The party acquires crucial intel about the harvest control center in [Crystallium]], but as they prepare to leave Tenebrarum, every shadow in the city suddenly freezes in place. A voice echoes from all shadows simultaneously: "[[The Parliament of Shadows has reached a verdict. Original-kind is found guilty of oppression. The sentence is replacement. [The Deep]] Harvest begins at the next tide—in six hours. Those who resist will watch their shadows devour their loved ones first." Marina's shadow turns to the party: "I can get you to Crystallium, but only if you help me kill my original. She's not who you think she is." Marina herself draws her weapon: "Don't listen to it. I'm the real Marina. That thing stole my life three years ago." The party must choose who to trust as shadow enforcers surround their location. --- ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*
