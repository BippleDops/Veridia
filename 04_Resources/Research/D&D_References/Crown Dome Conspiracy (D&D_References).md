--- # Crown Dome Conspiracy ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Role and Motive

Crown Dome Conspiracy moves information and influence like currency. Publicly pragmatic, privately driven by a personal stake in the Convergenceâ€™s shape. - Ideal: Stability through controlled risk.
- Bond: A family archive tied to [[The Sunken Library]].
- Flaw: Overconfidence in leverage; underestimates zealots and true believers. ## Player-Facing Summary Crown Dome Conspiracy is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Crown Dome Conspiracy as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Crown Dome Conspiracy. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Alliance - Manipulate succession ## Plot Hooks - A noble needs help stealing before the festival
