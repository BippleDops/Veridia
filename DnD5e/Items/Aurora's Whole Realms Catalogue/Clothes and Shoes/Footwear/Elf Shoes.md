### Elf Shoes (Pic)

## Description
The world is filled with elven adventurers writing home for a new pair of boots each season. Write no longer. Aurora’s now stocks your favorite [[Footwear|footwear]]. These go for 45 gp a pair, and are certain to make you quiet. Unfortunately, elves are the only ones who can get their slender feet into these. I’ve spoken to the craftsmen about “other” sizes, but they claim that half of the benefit of the shoe comes from the elf foot inside them. Sorry, folks, but at least the orcs won’t be wearing them either.

## Additional Details
when an elf wears these shoes, he/she gains a +1 bonus on surprise rolls, and a +10% on move silently; no other creatures can gain these bonuses though, regardless of the method used to alter them to fit
