--- # Wall of Ice

*6th-level, Evocation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of quartz)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a globe with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (you choose which side) and makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking``dice: 10d6``Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has AC 12 and 30 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules) per 10-foot section, and it has [immunity-xphb (variant-rules)]] to Cold, Poison, and Psychic damage and [[Vulnerability Xphb to Fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 [hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] destroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn makes a Constitution saving throw, taking``dice: 5d6``Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage the wall deals when it appears increases by``dice: 2d6``and the damage from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by`d6`for each spell slot level above 6. **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 339.
