# Wand of Pyrotechnics
*Wand, common*  

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to expend 1 charge and create a harmless burst of multicolored light at a point you can see up to 120 feet away. The burst of light is accompanied by a crackling noise that can be heard up to 300 feet away. The light is as bright as a torch flame but lasts only a second.
