## Description
One truism of farm life is that things are never where they need to be—especially heavy things. To assuage this perennial problem, we offer a sturdy wheelbarrow that can haul anything up to 400 lb—be it a load of grain, or one’s mate! The front wheel is made of sturdy iron by Berduskan wheelwrights, and the frame and rear wheel are made of solid duskwood. (15 gp)

## Additional Details
reduces base move by one quarter for each 100 lb to a minimum of 1
