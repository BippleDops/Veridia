# Shocking Grasp
Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes `dice: 1d8|avg` (1d8) lightning damage, and it can't take reactions until the start of its next turn.

The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (`dice: 2d8|avg` (2d8)), 11th level (`dice: 3d8|avg` (3d8)), and 17th level (`dice: 4d8|avg` (4d8)).
