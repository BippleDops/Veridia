Deep beneath [[Aquabyssos World Overview|Aquabyssos, older than the drowned civilizations above, lie the Primordial Vaults - a massive complex of chambers and passages that predate human civilization. Built by unknown hands for unclear purposes, the vaults contain horrors, treasures, and answers to questions that should never be asked. The architecture defies physics, with gravity, time, and space functioning irregularly. ### The Threshold Gates (8000 feet)

Seven massive doors, each requiring different keys or rituals to open. [Vault Keeper Eternal]] guards the entrance, neither alive nor dead, speaking only in riddles about "the necessity of drowning." ### The Hall of Untime

Corridor where time flows backward, forward, and sideways simultaneously. Those who enter may emerge younger, older, or multiplied into temporal echoes. [[Chronomancer Paradox exists here in seventeen versions of himself. ### The Genesis Chambers

Laboratories containing failed experiments in creating life. Twisted proto-creatures still writhe in crystalline tanks. [The First Failure]], a sentient mistake, pleads for death or freedom. ### The Inverse Cathedral

A cathedral built upside-down, where prayers spoken become curses and holy water burns like acid. [[Anti Priest us conducts backwards sermons to an congregation of shadows. ### The Memory Core

Central chamber containing crystallized memories of the world's creation. Touching them grants knowledge but steals personal memories in exchange. [The Forgotten One]] dwells here, made entirely of stolen memories. ### The Deepest Lock

The final chamber, sealed with thirteen locks, each key hidden throughout Aquabyssos. Behind it lies something that [[The Great Drowning was meant to keep imprisoned. ### The Creation Tablets

Stone tablets describing how to create and destroy worlds. Written in a language that damages the mind to read. ### The First Key

Master key that allegedly opens any lock in existence, including metaphysical ones like death or fate. ### The Unwater

Liquid that undoes the drowning wherever it touches, but spreads madness with its use. ### The Original Sin

Physical manifestation of the first wrongdoing, touching it reveals your worst nature. ### The Cage of Gods

Empty prison that once held deities. Their escape may have triggered the drowning. ### Gravity Wells

Areas where gravity pulls in impossible directions, creating Escher-like navigation challenges. ### Temporal Storms

Violent distortions aging or reversing anything caught within. ### Reality Bleeds

Places where other dimensions leak through, bringing alien geometries and entities. ### Memory Hurricanes

Psychic storms that scramble memories and personalities of those caught within. ### The Void Pools

Black water that doesn't reflect anything - falling in erases you from history. ## Current Activity

1. [Order of the Sunken Crown]] expedition seeking the First Key
2. Tremors suggesting something massive stirring in the Deepest Lock
3. Vault Guardians becoming active after centuries of dormancy
4. Reality bleeds increasing in frequency
5. [[The Deepmind]] sending psychic probes into the vaults ## Secrets

> [!warning] DM Only
> - The vaults were built to contain the entity that would eventually cause the drowning
> - The Great Drowning was Plan B after the vaults began failing
> - The Deepest Lock contains not one entity but a gateway to their dimension
> - Several faction leaders know the truth and are preparing for the eventual breach
> - The vaults are slowly rising toward the surface ## Vault Laws (Inexplicable Rules)

1. No one may speak their true name within
2. Every third step must be backward
3. Blood spilled becomes sentient
4. Lies become truth, truth becomes lies
5. Death is temporary but madness is permanent ## Random Encounters (d12)

1. Temporal echo of future/past party
2. Gravity suddenly reversing
3. Door appearing in empty wall
4. Guardian construct activating
5. Memory hurricane approaching
6. Lost explorer begging for death
7. Reality bleed opening
8. The Unmaker's presence felt
9. Vault rearranging around party
10. Ancient prisoner attempting escape
11. Paradox Sentinel patrol
12. The First Key's guardian ## Player-Facing Summary The Primordial Vaults is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Primordial Vaults as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around The Primordial Vaults. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A letter reveals a betrayal about this place
