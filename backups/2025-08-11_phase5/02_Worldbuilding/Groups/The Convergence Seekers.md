# The Convergence Seekers
*Bridgers of the Realms, Architects of Unity*

## Overview
The Convergence Seekers believe that [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] were once a single world, artificially separated by divine intervention, and that reuniting them is not only possible but necessary for both realms' survival. Operating in secret cells across both worlds, they work to weaken the barriers between realities, believing that convergence will create a paradise combining the best of both realms while eliminating their respective weaknesses.

## Core Ideology
### The Unity Theory
- Both worlds are fragments of a greater whole
- Current separation causes instability in both realms
- Crystal corruption in Aethermoor and shadow corruption in Aquabyssos are symptoms of separation
- [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]] are connected parts of original divine system
- Reunification will heal both worlds' ailments

### The Convergence Plan
1. **Phase One**: Establish communication and transport between worlds
2. **Phase Two**: Create permanent bridges and mixed communities
3. **Phase Three**: Align the Seven Shards with Deep Mother's awakening
4. **Phase Four**: Perform the Great Convergence ritual
5. **Phase Five**: Guide the merged world through initial chaos

## Organization Structure
### Leadership Council
- **[[The Mediator]]**: Mysterious supreme leader who claims to remember the unified world
- **[[Sage of Two Worlds]]**: Chief theorist and ritual designer
- **[[The Bridge Walker]]**: Master of inter-realm travel and communication
- **[[Captain Between]]**: Military coordinator for both realms
- **[[The Memory Weaver]]**: Historian and keeper of pre-separation lore

### Operational Cells
#### Aethermoor Division
- **Crystal Theorists**: Study Shard connections to Aquabyssos
- **Reality Mappers**: Chart weak points between dimensions
- **Infiltrators**: Place agents in major factions
- **Resource Gatherers**: Collect materials for convergence rituals
- **Safe Housers**: Maintain hidden bases and supply networks

#### Aquabyssos Division
- **Dream Swimmers**: Navigate the Deep Mother's unconscious for clues
- **Shadow Walkers**: Use shadow corruption to access other realm
- **Depth Surveyors**: Map physical connection points in deep ocean
- **Memory Traders**: Collect experiences of cross-realm phenomena
- **Current Riders**: Provide transportation for cross-realm agents

### The Between Agents
- Elite operatives who can exist in both worlds simultaneously
- Created through dangerous ritual involving both Shard energy and shadow exposure
- Serve as communication links between realm divisions
- Gradually losing connection to either world as they become something new
- May represent evolution toward post-convergence humanity

## Current Operations
### Active Projects

### Secret Alliances
- Some [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Silverscale Consortium]] members see profit in inter-realm trade
- Radical elements of [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Drowned Prophets]] believe convergence will wake Deep Mother
- Certain [[Order of the Shattered Crown]] members think convergence will unite the Shards
- Shadow merchants profit from cross-realm smuggling operations
- A few government officials in both realms secretly support unity

## Resources & Capabilities

4. **The Reality Storm**: Investigate dimensional instabilities caused by Seeker activities
5. **The Great Debate**: Participate in philosophical/political discussions about convergence

## Moral Complexity
### The Unity Question
- Would convergence create paradise or catastrophe?
- Do they have right to make decision affecting entire worlds?
- Is current separation natural or artificial constraint?
- Would merged world preserve what makes each realm unique?
- Can gradual convergence avoid traumatic reality collapse?

### The Method Dilemma
- Their goals may be noble but methods often cause immediate harm
- Secrecy necessary for success but prevents democratic discussion
- Experiments risk catastrophic failure affecting millions
- Some members become fanatical, justifying any means for convergence
- Balance between patience and urgency as crises mount in both worlds

## Secret Agenda & Conspiracies

### The Deep Convergence Plan
Unknown to most members, the inner circle has discovered that the separation of worlds was not divine intervention but a protective measure. The original world was infected by an entity from outside reality that could only be contained by splitting it between realms. Their convergence efforts risk releasing this cosmic parasite.

### Between Agent Transformation
The process of becoming a Between Agent is irreversible and eventually leads to complete disconnection from both worlds. The leadership knows this but continues recruitment, believing the sacrifice necessary for the greater good.

### The Mediator's Identity
The mysterious leader is actually [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]], who has been manipulating events from behind the scenes. Their true goal may be to create a merged world they can rule as supreme being.

### Foreign Influence
Some Convergence Seeker operations are secretly funded by entities from parallel dimensions who want to destabilize both realms for their own invasion attempts.

### The Reality Cascade Risk
Their experiments have already created several small reality tears that could expand into dimension-ending catastrophes. Only the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Void Watchers]] are aware of this growing threat.

## Internal Politics & Conflicts

### Philosophical Divisions
#### The Unificationists
- Believe convergence should happen gradually over centuries
- Favor diplomatic and cultural approaches
- Led by moderate members concerned about casualties
- Support voluntary integration programs
- Often conflict with Immedialist faction

#### The Immedialists
- Want convergence to happen within decades
- Willing to use force and dangerous experiments
- Believe delay risks world-ending catastrophes in both realms
- Led by extremist members including some Between Agents
- Sometimes work directly against Unificationist operations

#### The Purists
- Want to restore the exact original world
- Oppose any adaptation to current realm conditions
- Reject Between Agent transformation as corruption
- Small but vocal minority often causing internal strife
- May ally with enemies to stop "impure" convergence attempts

### Resource Competition
- Aethermoor and Aquabyssos divisions compete for funding and priority
- Between Agents increasingly isolated from both realm-bound members
- Research departments withhold discoveries from each other
- Safe houses and supply networks sometimes serve personal rather than organizational goals
- Leadership succession disputes create operational inefficiencies

### Moral Debates
#### The Consent Question
- Should worlds be merged without universal democratic approval?
- How to handle populations that prefer current separation?
- Rights of future generations vs. current citizens
- Obligations to minority factions that benefit from separation
- Balance between individual choice and species survival

#### The Sacrifice Dilemma
- Is Between Agent transformation ethical if members aren't told it's irreversible?
- Should dangerous experiments continue if they risk reality collapse?
- When does necessary secrecy become harmful deception?
- How many lives justify risking convergence for potential utopia?
- Responsibility for failed experiments that create dimensional anomalies
