## Read-Aloud
> The tribunal manifests from nowhere: robed doubles, mirrored eyes. They demand to know which of you has the right to lead.

## Setup

## Mechanics
- Persuasion/Intimidation DC 15 to sway
- History/Law DC 14 for precedent
- Group Sanity DC 14 to maintain selves

## Outcomes
- Success: Court rules for the captain; legitimacy boon
- Partial: Split command penalty (Command -1) for 24h
