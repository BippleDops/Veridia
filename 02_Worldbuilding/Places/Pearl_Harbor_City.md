# Pearl Harbor City

*Gateway Between Worlds*

## Overview

Pearl Harbor City stands as Aquathys's primary connection to the surface world, a bustling metropolis built within a massive underwater dome that maintains variable pressure zones. The city exists in a constant state of controlled chaos as traders, smugglers, diplomats, and adventurers from both above and below the waves converge here.

## Geography

### Districts

#### **The Locks District**

A marvel of magical engineering, this area contains massive pressure-adjustment chambers that allow surface dwellers to safely descend and deep dwellers to ascend. Each lock takes 4 hours to fully cycle.

- **Fence:** [[12_Research/D&D_Statblocks/The Barnacle]]
- Password: "The tide always turns"

## Adventure Hooks
