## Description

No one knows Scarlett's real name anymore - she's been The Crimson Pearl for so long that even she might have forgotten. A hauntingly beautiful sea elf with skin like polished alabaster and eyes that glow crimson in darkness. She drapes herself in strings of blood-red pearls that pulse with an unnatural light. Her movements are too fluid, too graceful, as if she's not quite bound by the same physics as others.
