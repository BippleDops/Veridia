## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing an adult or ancient blue dragon's lair is changed by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Sinkholes.** Sinkholes form more frequently in the area within 1 mile of the lair. Whenever a creature in that area other than the dragon and its allies finishes a [[long-rest-xphb]], roll `d20`. On a 1, a sinkhole opens beneath the creature, and the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or fall `2d4 Ã— 10` feet into the sinkhole.  
- **Spiteful Storms.** Dust devils and thunderstorms rage within 1 mile of the lair. The area is [[lightly-obscured-xphb (variant-rules)]].  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

## Player-Facing Summary

Blue dragon xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of blue dragon xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around blue dragon xmm.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
