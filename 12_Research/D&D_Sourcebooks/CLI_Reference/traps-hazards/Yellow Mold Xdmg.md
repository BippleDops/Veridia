# Yellow Mold
*Generic Hazard*  

Yellow mold grows in dark places, and one patch covers a 5-foot square. If touched, the mold ejects a cloud of spores that fills a 10-foot [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb|Cube]]. Any creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (`2d10`) Poison damage and have the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition for 1 minute. While Poisoned in this way, the creature takes 5 (`d10`) Poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Direct sunlight or any amount of Fire damage destroys a patch of yellow mold.
