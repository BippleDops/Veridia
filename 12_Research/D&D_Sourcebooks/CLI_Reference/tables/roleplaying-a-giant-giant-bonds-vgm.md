| 1 | My clan is the most important influence on my life, our collective place in the ordning depends on our devotion to one another. |
| 2 | My clan mates who serve in our deity's temples are the closest companions I'll ever know. |
| 3 | My place in the ordning is ordained by our patron deity, and it would be blasphemous to aspire to anything higher or lower. |
