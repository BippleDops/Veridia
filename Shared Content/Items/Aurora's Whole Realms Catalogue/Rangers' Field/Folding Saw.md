## Description
Tree-felling tools are commonly quite bulky. Few adventuring woodsmen can carry an [[Axe|axe]] and saw upon the trail. However, with our new folding saw, woodsmen can have a sharp and sturdy blade on hand at any time. Merely by removing the retaining band, opening the hinged blade, and locking it in place with the flat band, the woodsman can have a blade ready.

## Additional Details
cuts through 4 in sq of soft wood per round, 2 in sq of hardwood; ineffective as a weapon
