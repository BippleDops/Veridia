## For the Table (Quick Use)
- Negotiation DCs: Honest trade **DC 12**; Gray market **DC 15**; Smuggling **DC 17**. On a failure, progress with a telltale rumor seeded in the crowd instead of stalling.
- Hazards: Pressure surges (CON save **DC 13** or gain 1 level of Fatigue), slipstream knocks (DEX save **DC 12** or lose 1 item to the current).
- Rewards: Faction favor notes, tariff keys, market scrip worth `dice: 2d10`×10 gp in local value.

## Threads to the Main Campaign
- Archivists claim a ledger fragment pointing toward [02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Lighthouse of Storms]].
- A clandestine auction circles artifacts tied to [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/The Whispering Expanse.
- An information broker with ties to [02_Worldbuilding/People/Elena Starweaver.md|Elena Starweaver]] trades memories for favors.

## Multiple Resolution Paths (Fail-Forward)
- Buy the schedule: Secure the Pressure Gate manifests; even on failure, you obtain a partial list that points to a decoy shipment and fresh leads.
- Bribe or distract: Create a diversion at Echo Quay; on a setback, the guard marks you but also warns of a coming tariff strike.
- Formal petition: Argue precedent at the Quiet Chapel; on a miss, the judge imposes a bond that grants limited passage and a clock to pay it back.
