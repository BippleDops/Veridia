--- # Save the Citizens *"When disaster strikes, heroes answer the call of the innocent."* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Save the Citizens represents emergency rescue operations where characters must protect and evacuate civilian populations during various catastrophes affecting both Aethermoor and Aquabyssos. These missions require coordination, resource management, and difficult decisions about who can be saved when time and resources are limited. ## Historical Background

Citizen rescue protocols developed after major disasters highlighted the need for organized emergency response. Early rescue attempts were often chaotic and resulted in unnecessary casualties. ## Current State

Modern rescue operations use improved coordination systems and magical enhancements, though they remain challenging when dealing with inter-realm disasters or supernatural threats. ## Adventure Hooks

1. **Natural Disaster**: Earthquake or flood requires mass evacuation
2. Subsequently, **Monster Attack**: Citizens trapped during creature assault
3. **Magical Catastrophe**: Dimensional instability threatens populated areas ## Campaign Use

Provides moral weight to adventures and opportunities for heroic actions with lasting consequences. ## Player-Facing Summary Save the Citizens is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Save the Citizens as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Save the Citizens. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A shipment has gone missing and chaos spreads
