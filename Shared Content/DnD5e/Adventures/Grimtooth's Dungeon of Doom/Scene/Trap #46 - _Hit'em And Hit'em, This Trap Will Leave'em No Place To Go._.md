# Trap #46 - "Hit'em And Hit'em, This Trap Will Leave'em No Place To Go."
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> Once this door is entered the party will find itself at the bottom of a circular staircase. This stair has an unusually broad banister on both the inside central pole, and the outside against the stone wall. The stair leads up into the darkness. 
> 
> Once the party begins to ascend they will find the steps are a comfortable distance apart and the climb is smooth and gradual. There is no obvious problem, until the party reaches a point 50 feet up the cylindrical shaft of the stairs. At this point they will find a fine wire stretching from one banister to the other.
> 
> This is so clearly a trap that the party will go to great lengths to avoid it. In so doing they will not notice that 10 steps beyond this they will come to a series of 10 steps any one of which when depressed will set off the trap at the top of the spiral stairs. (Keep in mind that if descending this stair the trap will activate just as well.)
> 
> At the top a panel concealed beneath the stucco of the ceiling will open and out will roll a gigantic stone ball over 10 feet in diameter. This will fall onto the banisters and race down the stairs with escalating speed until it hits the party. The telltale crash and resultant roaring rumble will hint to the party that something is on its way down to meet them.
> 
> The only way to avoid the doom which is decending upon the party is to get down as low as possible on the stairs. (Note wizards haô€‚¼e been able to fly out of many of these traps. Lets hope they think like that now!)
> 
> Anyone who has not ducked under the ball will be hit by it about chest high. The ball does `dice: 300D6` damage and proceeds unimpeded.
> 
> While the party has been dodging the onrushing roar of this ball a second ball has been released at the top only 5 seconds behind the fust. This one is only slightly smaller than 10 feet and fits neatly under the banisters. This ball comes rumbling down the stairs.
> 
> Any delvers who feel neglected by the first ball will very likely meet the second. The way to survive is to duck under the first ball, then jump up on the banister in the face of the second, equally lethal ball. The balls will smash into gravel upon impact at the bottom, for neatness sake.
> 
> Once again Evinrood delivers his customary one two punch, this one is a four skull wonder. At the top of the stairs the party reemerges at the end of the hall of crystal warriors.
