# Mithral Armor
*Uncommon*  



Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes.

If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity ([[skills#Stealth|Stealth]]) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't.
