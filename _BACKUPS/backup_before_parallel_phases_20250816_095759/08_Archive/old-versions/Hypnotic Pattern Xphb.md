*3rd-level, Illusion* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a pinch of confetti)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute You create a twisting pattern of colors in a 30-foot [[Cube Area of Effect Xphb within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who can see the pattern must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] condition for the duration. While [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed, the creature has the [conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] condition and a [[Fly Speed Xphb of 0. The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor. **Classes**: [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 287.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of hypnotic pattern xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around hypnotic pattern xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A map reveals the truth about a local noble
