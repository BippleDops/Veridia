--- # Traveling Merchant Finn **Type:** Mystery/Investigation/Social Intrigue **Level:** 3-8 **Location:** [[Abyssos Prime, [The Trade Quarter]], [[Smuggler's Cove, [Goldspire Port]] **Duration:** 3-4 sessions **Threat:** A seemingly innocent traveling merchant is at the center of a cross-realm conspiracy involving stolen artifacts, identity theft, and dangerous magical experiments ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

[[Traveling Merchant Finn has built a reputation as one of the most reliable independent traders operating between [Aquabyssos]] and [[Aethermoor. His routes span dangerous territories, his prices are fair, and his goods are always authentic. But when valuable items from his recent shipments begin turning up in places they shouldn't be, and multiple versions of "Finn" start appearing in different cities simultaneously, the party is hired to investigate what might be an elaborate fraud—or something far more dangerous. ## Background

The real Finn was indeed a legitimate merchant who disappeared six months ago during what should have been a routine trading expedition to [The Cerulean Trench]]. His identity has been stolen by a network of shapeshifters working for [[The Shadow Exchange—a criminal organization that specializes in magical identity theft and cross-realm smuggling. The imposters have been using Finn's reputation to move stolen artifacts and conduct illegal magical experiments while gathering intelligence on both realms' security systems. What makes this particularly dangerous is that one of the "Finns" has acquired genuine magical ability to split his consciousness across multiple bodies, making him nearly impossible to track or contain. The investigation will lead the party through multiple layers of deception, cross-realm politics, and confrontations with entities that may not be entirely human. ## Phase 1: The Discrepancies (1 session)

**Location:** [Abyssos Prime]] - The Trade Quarter **Objective:** Investigate reports of impossible merchant activities ### The Initial Reports

**Multiple simultaneous sightings:**
- Finn was seen selling rare crystals at the dawn market
- The same morning, Finn was witnessed loading cargo at the deep docks
- Meanwhile, Finn was reportedly having lunch with government officials
- All witnesses insist they spoke with the "real" Finn and have documentation to prove it **Evidence of Impossibility:**
- **Time Stamps**: Crystalline transaction records show Finn in three places within the same hour
- **Signature Analysis**: All signatures match perfectly, including magical verification
- **Memory Confirmation**: Multiple reliable witnesses have clear recollections of detailed conversations
- **Physical Evidence**: Different versions of Finn's personal items found at various locations
- **Magical Traces**: Tracking spells show multiple distinct but identical aura signatures ### Investigation Methods

**Witness Interviews:**
- **Market Vendors**: Describe normal interactions but with subtle personality differences
- **Dock Workers**: Report Finn's cargo manifests don't match his usual trade goods - **Government Clerks**: Note that Finn submitted permits for conflicting business activities
- **Inn Keepers**: Multiple establishments have records of Finn staying overnight on the same date
- **Guild Representatives**: Conflicting reports about Finn's membership and good standing **Evidence Collection:**
- **Transaction Records**: Pattern analysis reveals impossible travel times
- **Magical Forensics**: [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos detects multiple overlapping aura signatures
- **Document Analysis**: Handwriting shows microscopic variations suggesting copying or forgery
- **Inventory Tracking**: Items supposedly sold by Finn appear in multiple markets simultaneously
- **Communication Logs**: Messages sent "from Finn" originate from different locations at impossible times ### Key Discoveries (**DC 15** Investigation)

1. **Behavioral Patterns**: The different Finns have slightly different speech patterns and preferences
2. **Knowledge Gaps**: Some versions lack information that the real Finn would certainly know
3. **Physical Inconsistencies**: Minor differences in scars, calluses, and personal habits
4. **Magical Anomalies**: Detection spells reveal layered enchantments and illusion magic
5. **Ficial Irregularities**: Bank accounts show simultaneous withdrawals from multiple locations ## Phase 2: Following the Threads (1-2 sessions)

**Location:** Various - tracking the different Finns throughout [Aquabyssos]] **Objective:** Locate and observe the multiple versions to understand their operation ### Surveillance Challenges

**The Three Primary Finns:**
- **Market Finn**: Operates legitimate-appearing business in established trading areas
- **Smuggler Finn**: Works the underground markets and illegal transport networks
- **Official Finn**: Maintains relationships with government contacts and permits **Tracking Complications:**
- **Magical Countermeasures**: Finns use illusion magic to obscure their movements
- **Network Support**: Other shapeshifters provide alibis and misdirection
- **Legitimate Business**: Much of their activity appears completely normal and legal
- **Cross-Realm Travel**: Some operations extend beyond [[Aquabyssos jurisdiction
- **Memory Modification**: Witnesses may have altered recollections of interactions ### Following Market Finn

**Location:** [The Trade Quarter]], [[Crystal Markets **Activities:** Selling genuine high-quality goods at competitive prices
**Suspicious Elements:**
- Has access to items that should be impossible to obtain legally
- Customers report he sometimes "forgets" previous conversations
- Inventory appears and disappears without corresponding shipment records
- Pricing strategy suggests he's not concerned about long-term profit margins ### Following Smuggler Finn

**Location:** [Smuggler's Cove]], [[The Shadow Markets **Activities:** Moving questionable cargo through illegal channels
**Suspicious Elements:**
- Trafficking in items stolen from legitimate merchants
- Has connections to organized crime that the real Finn would never develop
- Uses knowledge of security procedures that suggests inside information
- Appears to be gathering intelligence rather than maximizing profits ### Following Official Finn

**Location:** Government buildings, legitimate business establishments **Activities:** Processing permits and maintaining official relationships
**Suspicious Elements:**

**Freeing the Original Finn:**
- **Crystal Matrix Disruption**: Requires specific magical frequencies to safely release consciousness
- **Memory Reconstruction**: Must piece together fragmented memories to restore complete personality
- **Life Force Transfer**: Need to redirect energy from duplicates back to original
- **Temporal Synchronization**: Timing is critical to prevent consciousness from dispersing
- **Identity Restoration**: Help original Finn distinguish his real memories from duplicate experiences **Consequences of Success/Failure:**
- **Complete Success**: Original Finn rescued, all duplicates dissolved, Shadow Exchange operation exposed
- **Partial Success**: Finn rescued but damaged, some duplicates survive independently
- **Failure**: Original Finn dies, duplicates remain active, Shadow Exchange escapes to continue operations ### Possible Outcomes **Complete Victory:**

- Original Finn rescued and fully restored
- All magical duplicates safely dissolved
- Shadow Exchange leadership captured or eliminated
- Evidence leads to broader investigation of replaced officials
- Party gains reputation as investigators of magical crimes **Pyrrhic Victory:**
- Finn rescued but permanently changed by the experience
- Some duplicates survive and escape with fragments of his identity
- Shadow Exchange damaged but not destroyed
- Political ramifications as some replaced officials are exposed
- Mixed feelings about the moral implications of destroying sentient copies **Tragic Failure:**
- Original Finn dies during rescue attempt
- Duplicates continue operating with his stolen identity
- Shadow Exchange adapts and improves their techniques
- Broader conspiracy remains hidden and continues to grow
- Party becomes targets of the organization they failed to stop ### Themes to Emphasize

- **Identity**: What makes someone who they are beyond physical appearance?
- **Memory**: How do experiences shape consciousness and personality?
- **Trust**: How do you verify truth when everything can be faked?
- **Consciousness**: Do artificial beings have rights if they believe themselves to be real? > [!danger] DM Secret

> The original Finn isn't entirely innocent—he discovered the Shadow Exchange operation and tried to blackmail them rather than report it to authorities. His capture was partially his own fault, but he's learned from the experience and genuinely wants to make amends. This revelation can create interesting moral complexity about whether he deserves complete sympathy and whether the party should help him avoid consequences for his original poor judgment. ## Player-Facing Summary Traveling Merchant Finn is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
