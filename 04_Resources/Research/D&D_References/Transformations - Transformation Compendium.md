--- # Transformation Compendium

*100+ Paths to Power and Peril* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview Transformations represent fundamental changes to a character's nature—physical, mental, or spiritual alterations that grant new abilities at the cost of humanity. Each transformation follows a progression path with increasing benefits and drawbacks. ### Transformation Points

Characters accumulate Transformation Points (TP) through exposure, choice, or curse. Every 10 TP advances to the next stage. ### Stages of Transformation

1. **Stage I - Awakening** (1-10 TP): Minor changes, easily hidden
2. **Stage II - Manifestation** (11-20 TP): Obvious alterations, social complications
3. **Stage III - Evolution** (21-30 TP): Major abilities, significant drawbacks
4. **Stage IV - Metamorphosis** (31-40 TP): Powerful but alienating
5. **Stage V - Transcendence** (41+ TP): Barely human, immense power ### 🦠 Parasite Transformations

*Symbiotic entities that grant power through biological fusion* ### 💎 Crystal Transformations

*Mineral corruption spreading through body and soul* ### 🌊 Deep Mother Transformations

*Blessings and curses from the primordial depths* ### 🔧 Tech-Bio Transformations

*Fusion of flesh and ancient technology* ### 🌀 Elemental Transformations

*Becoming one with primal forces* ### 👁️ Aberrant Transformations

*Mutations beyond natural law* ### Gaining Transformation Points **Voluntary Methods**:

- Ritual participation: `dice: 1d4` TP
- Consuming transformation catalysts: `dice: 1d6` TP
- Pact with transformation entity: `dice: 2d6` TP
- Using transformation items: 1 TP per use **Involuntary Exposure**:
- Environmental hazards: 1 TP per hour
- Creature attacks: 1 TP per critical hit
- Magical contamination: `dice: 1d4` TP per failed save
- Proximity to transformation source: 1 TP per day ### Managing Transformations **Slowing Progression**:

- Protection spells reduce TP gain by half
- Resistance training grants advantage on saves
- Purification rituals remove `dice: 1d4` TP (costly)
- Divine intervention can halt progression **Accelerating Transformation**:
- Embracing changes doubles TP gain
- Transformation focus items add +`dice: 1d4` TP
- Symbiotic relationships increase efficiency
- Stress and trauma trigger surges ### Social Consequences **Stage I**: Easily concealed, -2 to social rolls if discovered

**Stage II**: Disadvantage on Persuasion, advantage on Intimidation
**Stage III**: Cannot hide nature, many refuse interaction
**Stage IV**: Treated as monster by most civilized folk
**Stage V**: Hunted by authorities, feared by all ## Quick Random Transformation Table **d100 Roll**:

Every transformation tells a story."* ## Player-Facing Summary Transformation Compendium is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Transformation Compendium as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Transformation Compendium. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Plot Hooks - An heirloom has gone missing and evil awakens

- A prisoner has gone missing and chaos spreads
- A shipment has gone missing and war looms
- Strange accidents suggest a curse ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
