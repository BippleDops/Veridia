Depth Pressure Rings represent one of the most fundamental and widely-used magical items in Aquabyssos, providing essential protection against the crushing pressures of deep-ocean environments. These simple but vital rings allow surface-dwelling races to survive and thrive in the underwater cities and deep-sea locations that comprise most of Aquabyssos civilization. So common and necessary are these rings that they're considered as essential as clothing in underwater society, with variants available for every social class and economic level. #### The Ring Shortage
