## Quest Details
The party is hired by Archmage Celestine Starweaver to investigate the activities of the Order of the Azure Flame. The Archmage has heard rumors that the Order has discovered a powerful magical artifact from the old world, and she fears that they will use it to wipe out all magic from the Shattered Isles.

### Objectives
- [ ] Travel to the Whispering Peaks.
- [ ] Infiltrate the Citadel of the Azure Flame.

- [ ] Make a choice that will determine the future of magic in the Shattered Isles.

### Rewards
- A powerful magical artifact.
- The gratitude of the Harpers.
- The enmity of the Order of the Azure Flame.

## GM Notes
- The artifact that the Order has discovered is not a weapon, but a device that can be used to heal the damage caused by the Sundering.
- The Order has misinterpreted the device's function and believes that it is a weapon that can be used to destroy all magic.
- The party will have to decide whether to destroy the device, use it to heal the world, or turn it over to the Harpers.
