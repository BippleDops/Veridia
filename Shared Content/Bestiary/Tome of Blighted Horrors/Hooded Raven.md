## Description
The sight of the hooded raven flying overhead is seen as an ill omen and that someone soon will perish. These creatures, like all carrion birds, have clawed talons and sharp beaks perfect for tearing flesh. Their enhanced eyesight allows them to spot a meal from great distances, and they typically swoop down the wide lanes of city streets high above the ground in search of a ripening carcass or a live mouse.

The hooded raven is omnivorous, with a diet similar to that of the carrion crow, and is a constant scavenger. It drops mollusks and crabs to break them after the manner of the crow, and the common name for empty sea urchin shells is “crow’s cups.” It also feeds on small mammals, scraps, smaller birds, and carrion. The raven has the habit of hiding food, especially meat or nuts, in places such as rain gutters, flowerpots, or in the earth under bushes to feed on later, and sometimes on the insects that have meanwhile been attracted to it.

These large cousins of normal ravens generally weigh between 6 and 8 pounds, with a wingspan of up to 4 feet.

A hooded raven uses the standard raven stat block but with the added trait Prognostication (1/day): Hooded ravens have a natural ability to predict the immediate future. Once per day, it gets a +10 bonus on any die roll (including a damage roll) or to its AC. The bonus can be applied after dice are rolled but before the final result is determined.
