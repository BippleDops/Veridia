# Frost Fingers (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *1st-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (15-foot cone)

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, shards of ice shoot out from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
