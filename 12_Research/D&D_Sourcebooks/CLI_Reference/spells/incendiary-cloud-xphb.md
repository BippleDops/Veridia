# Incendiary Cloud
*8th-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A swirling cloud of embers and smoke fills a 20-foot-radius [[sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]] centered on a point within range. The cloud's area is [[heavily-obscured-xphb|Heavily Obscured]]. It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (like that created by [[gust-of-wind-xphb|Gust of Wind]]) disperses it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `10d8` Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the [[sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]] moves into its space and when it enters the [[sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]] or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

The cloud moves 10 feet away from you in a direction you choose at the start of each of your turns.

**Classes**: [[list-spells-classes-druid|Druid]]; [[list-spells-classes-sorcerer|Sorcerer]]; [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]; [[list-spells-classes-wizard|Wizard]]
