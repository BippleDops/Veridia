*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 175, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 133* When Doresain, the King of Ghouls, corrupted a society of elves, he created a new sort of demonâ€”the maurezhiâ€”to lead packs of [[ghoul-xmm (undead)]] and [[ghast-xmm (undead)]] on the Material Plane. When a maurezhi consumes the corpse of a Humanoid it has slainâ€”a process that takes about 10 minutesâ€”it instantly assumes the creature's appearance as it was in life. The new appearance begins to rot away over the next few days, eventually revealing the demon's original form. A maurezhi is contagion incarnate. Its bite can drain a victim's sense of self. If this affliction is allowed to go far enough, the victim is infected with an unholy hunger for flesh that overpowers their personality and transforms them into a ghoul.```statblock
