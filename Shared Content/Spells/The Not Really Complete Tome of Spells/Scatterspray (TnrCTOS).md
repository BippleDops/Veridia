# Scatterspray (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *cantrip*

**School**: *Evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You point to any group of small, unsecured items (each of which may be no larger than a henâ€™s egg), within range, which must be piled together in an area of no more than 1 square foot, and cause them to fly off in all directions. The DM must decide if the items are hard or sharp enough to cause damage. If so, all creatures within 20 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1 to 1d4 points of either bludgeoning or piercing damage, depending on the weight and type of item that is scattered.
