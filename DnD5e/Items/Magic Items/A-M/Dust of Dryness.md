# Dust of Dryness

## Overview
**Type**: Magic Item

**Group**: *Wondrous item*

**Rarity**: *uncommon*


## Description
This small packet contains `dice: 1d6+4` (1d6+4) pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over [[9 - The Environment|water]]. The dust turns a [[2 - Casting a Spell|cube]] of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet’s weight is negligible.

Someone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to [[Shatter|shatter]] and release the [[9 - The Environment|water]] the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet’s magic.

An elemental composed mostly of [[9 - The Environment|water]] that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 13 [[Constitution|Constitution]] saving throw, taking `dice: 10d6`(10d6) [[17 - Damage and Healing|necrotic]] damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
