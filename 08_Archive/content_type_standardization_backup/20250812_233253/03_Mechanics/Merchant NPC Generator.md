## Player-Facing Summary

The Merchant NPC Generator creates dynamic commercial characters who serve as more than simple shopkeepers, becoming integral parts of campaign storylines through their complex motivations, hidden agendas, and extensive networks of allies and enemies. These merchants offer opportunities for employment, partnership, conflict, and adventure across both realms.

## DM Notes

Use the merchant generator to create recurring NPCs who grow and change alongside the campaign. Each merchant should feel like a real person with genuine goals, fears, and relationships rather than a simple vendor. Consider how merchant relationships can drive long-term campaign development and provide ongoing plot hooks.

The economic complexity allows merchants to serve multiple campaign functions: quest givers, information sources, political connections, moral dilemmas, and sources of ongoing conflict. Use their business operations as frameworks for adventures that combine commerce, politics, culture, and personal drama.

Remember that merchants exist within larger economic and political systems. Their individual stories should connect to broader campaign themes about power, justice, cultural change, and the consequences of individual choices on wider society.
