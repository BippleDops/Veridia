# Circle of Death
*6th-level, Necromancy*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (the powder of a crushed black pearl worth 500+ GP)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Negative energy ripples out in a 60-foot-radius [Sphere](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) from a point you choose within range. Each creature in that area makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `8d8` Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `2d8` for each spell slot level above 6.

**Classes**: [Warlock](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Sorcerer](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Wizard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
