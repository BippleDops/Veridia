# Fire Bolt
You hurl a mote of fire at a creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `dice: 1d10|avg` (1d10) fire damage. A flammable object hit by this spell ignites if it isn't being worn or carried.

This spell's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (`dice: 2d10|avg` (2d10)), 11th level (`dice: 3d10|avg` (3d10)), and 17th level (`dice: 4d10|avg` (4d10)).
