# Quaal's Feather Token, Whip
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/quaals-feather-token-whip.webp#right)


This object looks like a feather.

You can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then take a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes `1d6 + 5` Force damage.

As a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]], you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to dismiss it, or when you die or have the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] condition.
