# Dimensional Shackles
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/dimensional-shackles.webp#right)

You can take a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action to place these shackles on a creature that has the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] condition. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. The shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don't prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.

You and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can take a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check. On a successful check, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.
