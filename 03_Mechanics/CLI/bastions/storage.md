# Storage
*Bastion facility*  

- **Space**: Cramped (4 sq; 500 GP, 20 days ^[500 GP and 20 days to add]), Roomy (16 sq; 1000 GP, 45 days ^[1000 GP and 45 days to add, or 500 GP and 25 days to enlarge from a Cramped Storage]), or Vast (36 sq; 3000 GP, 125 days ^[3000 GP and 125 days to add, or 2000 GP and 80 days to enlarge from a Roomy Storage])

A basic facility comes with nonmagical furnishings and decor appropriate for that facility.

## Player-Facing Summary

Storage is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of storage as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around storage.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties storage to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at storage to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to storage active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
