# 1358 - Time of Troubles
## Overview
**Date**: Sunday, 1 January 1358 12:00:00 AM

After the Tablets of Fate were stolen, the Overgod, Ao, forced all of the gods of Faerûn to walk on Toril in their mortal avatar forms. However, unlike when a god usually sent an avatar to Toril and his or her true form resided typically on one of the Outer Planes, the deities were all demoted and this was the only form that they had at the time, making them vulnerable, though still very powerful. Several major gods died during the Time of Troubles, and a small number of mortals attained divinity. Also during the catastrophic event, arcane and divine magic across Faerûn ceased to function properly, and chaos and destruction occurred throughout many nations and cities.
