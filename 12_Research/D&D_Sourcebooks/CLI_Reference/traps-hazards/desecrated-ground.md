# Desecrated Ground
*Wilderness Hazard*  

Some cemeteries and catacombs are imbued with the unseen traces of ancient evil. An area of desecrated ground can be any size, and a [[detect-evil-and-good-xphb|detect evil and good]] spell cast within range reveals its presence.

Undead standing on desecrated ground have advantage on all saving throws.

A vial of [[holy-water-xphb|holy water]] purifies a 10-foot-square area of desecrated ground when sprinkled on it, and a [[hallow-xphb|hallow]] spell purifies desecrated ground within its area.

Legends speak of desecrated ground as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around desecrated ground.

## Adventure Hooks

- An NPC seeks discreet help at desecrated ground to avert a public scandal.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
