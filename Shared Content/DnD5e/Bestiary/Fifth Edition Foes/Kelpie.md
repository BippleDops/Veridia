## Special Traits
**Amphibious:** A kelpie can breathe equally well in air or underwater.

**Charm (1/Day):** As an action, a kelpie can force a humanoid who can see the kelpie or hear her voice to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is immune to kelpie charm for 24 hours. If the save fails, the victim is charmed by the kelpie for 24 hours (the saving throw is not repeated each round, as it is with the kelpie's claw attack). A charmed creature perceives the kelpie as a beautiful and alluring creature and wants nothing more than to sit adoringly by its side, even if that means diving underwater and staying there forever. The charm is broken if the kelpie is killed or knocked unconscious, or if dispel magic, lesser restoration, or comparable magic is used on the charmed creature.

**Reshape Form:** A kelpie can assume four different physical forms. The first is simply a mass of tangled seaweed. The second is a female of any Small or Medium humanoid race, or a semihuman form in which she appears as a person from the waist up but from the hips down, she is still a tangle of seaweed. The third form is a [[Hippocampus|hippocampus]] (see that entry). The fourth form is a Large horse. In each form, the kelpie retains all of her special abilities. Kelpies do not polymorph as true shapechangers do, they simply reshape the seaweed of their bodies. In all of her forms, a kelpie's flesh or fur has a greenish cast and her features are slightly distorted, but this distortion is usually perceived as a strikingly beautiful exoticness. A nearby observer can spot the true nature of the creature with a successful DC 13 Wis (Perception) check, provided they're suspicious in the first place and are not charmed.

**Telepathy:** A kelpie can communicate telepathically to a range of 1 mile with any creature she's touched who is not immune to her charm.

## Actions
**Claws:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d6+2`) slashing damage and a humanoid target must make a successful DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by the kelpie. The effect is the same as the kelpie's charm ability (see above), but a humanoid charmed by this attack can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns; the charm is broken by a successful save. Charming from the claw attack is unlimited.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any aquatic

**Organization**: Solitary or bed (2â€“5)
