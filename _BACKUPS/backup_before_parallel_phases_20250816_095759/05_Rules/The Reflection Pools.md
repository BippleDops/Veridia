## Overview

Hidden in the [Twilight Depths]] between [[Sunken Palace|The [Sunken Palace]] and the Whispering Trenches, the Reflection Pools are a series of thirteen interconnected basins where the boundaries between possibility and actuality grow thin. Each pool shows not what is, but what could be—or what could have been. The site serves as Aquabyssos's premier divination center, though its revelations often drive visitors to madness or despair.

The Pools predate recorded history, possibly existing before water itself. They are maintained by the [[Order of Mirrors, blind [Oracle]]s who navigate by reading the ripples of possibility. Politicians, lovers, generals, and desperate souls all make pilgrimages here, though few leave with the answers they sought.

### The Approach

Reaching the Reflection Pools requires navigating the Corridor of Choices, a winding tunnel where each fork represents a significant decision in the visitor's life:
- **Length**: 3 miles of branching passages
- **Branches**: Unique to each visitor
- **Navigation**: Cannot be [[mapped—changes with each journey
- **[Time]]**: Takes exactly as long as needed for contemplation

**Danger**: Overwhelming em[path]]y paralysis

#### Pool of Knowledge Unlearned

**Diameter**: Library-vast
**Depth**: Scholar-deep
**Reveals**: Information that could have been known
**Danger**: Brain cannot hold all possibilities

#### Pool of Courage Unfound

**Diameter**: Shrinking when observed
**Depth**: Fear-frozen
**Reveals**: Bravery that failed to manifest
**Danger**: Permanent cowardice or reckless bravery

#### The Central Pool (The Mirror of Maybe)

**Diameter**: Perfect circle, 50 feet
**Depth**: Reflects the viewer

### The Order of Mirrors

**High Oracle Serendipity Twelve-Lives**
Leader of the Order, who exists in twelve possible versions simultaneously:

**Serendipity Twelve-Lives** (CR 15)
*Medium humanoid (human), true neutral*

**Armor Class** 15 (foresight)
**Hit Points** 135 (`dice: 18d8` + 54)
**Speed** 30 ft., swim 30 ft.

**Damage Resistances** psychic
**Condition Immunities** surprised
**Senses** blindsight 60 ft. (blind beyond this radius), passive Perception 22
**Languages** All
**Challenge** 15 (13,000 XP)

**Twelve-Fold Existence.** Serendipity exists in twelve parallel versions. When she would take damage, roll a d12. On a 12, the damage happens to a different version and she takes no damage.

**Probability Sight.** Serendipity can see all possible actions a creature might take in the next minute. She has advantage on all saving throws and cannot be surprised.

**Quantum Uncertainty.** Serendipity's exact position is uncertain. Attack rolls against her have [[Disadvantage.

**Spellcasting.** Serendipity is an 18th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save **DC 20**, +12 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following spells prepared:

Cantrips (at will): *[Guidance]]*, *mending*, *sacred flame*, *spare the dying*, *thaumaturgy*
1st level (4 slots): *[[Bless*, *command*, *detect magic*, *identify*
2nd level (3 slots): *augury*, *calm emotions*, *detect thoughts*, *see invisibility*
3rd level (3 slots): *clairvoyance*, *dispel magic*, *speak with dead*
4th level (3 slots): *divination*, *freedom of movement*, *locate creature*
5th level (3 slots): *commune*, *legend [Lore]]*, *scrying*
6th level (1 slot): *find the path*, *true seeing*
7th level (1 slot): *etherealness*, *plane shift*
8th level (1 slot): *antimagic field*, *feeblemind*
9th level (1 slot): *foresight*, *time stop*

**Actions**
**Multiattack.** Serendipity makes two Possibility Strike attacks.

**Possibility Strike.** *Melee Spell Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (`dice: 5d8`) force damage, and the target must succeed on a **DC 20** Wisdom saving throw or be stunned as they experience all possible outcomes of the attack simultaneously.

**Show the Paths (Recharge 5-6).** Serendipity forces a creature within 60 feet to see all their possible futures at once. The target must make a **DC 20** Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they take 55 (`dice: 10d10`) psychic damage and are paralyzed for 1 minute as they process infinite possibilities. On a success, they take half damage and gain advantage on all rolls for 1 minute as they see the optimal path.

**Legendary Actions**
Serendipity can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below.
- **Glimpse.** Serendipity learns one possible action a creature within 60 feet might take.
- **Shift.** Serendipity moves to a slightly different probability, moving up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Prophesy (Costs 2 Actions).** Serendipity speaks a prophecy about one creature she can see. For the next minute, whenever that creature rolls a 1, they can reroll and must use the new result.

**Actions**
**Multiattack.** The elemental makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (`dice: 3d8` + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (`dice: 2d8`) force damage.

**Possibility Storm (Recharge 5-6).** The elemental creates a 20-foot radius storm of conflicting realities. Each creature in the area must make a **DC 16** Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 36 (`dice: 8d8`) psychic damage and rolls on the Possibility Storm table. On a success, they take half damage and no additional effect.

**Possibility Storm Table (d6)**

### The Stolen Timeline

Someone has been using the pools to steal favorable outcomes from other timelines, causing [Reality Distortion]]s. [[The Party must track the thief through multiple possibilities and stop them before reality collapses.

### The Prophet's Paradox

A young oracle has seen their own death in every pool—except one that shows them destroying the Reflection Pools. The party must protect them while investigating if the prophecy is true or a manipulation.

### The Reflected Invasion

Alternate versions of significant [Npc]]s have been emerging from the pools and replacing their originals. The party must determine which are real and why the barriers between possibilities are weakening.

### The Impossible Child

A child who was never born has emerged from the Pool of What Was Never Born, claiming to be the offspring of a party member. Their existence is causing reality paradoxes that threaten to unravel causality.

### The Council of Selves

A powerful wizard has gathered versions of themselves from twelve different timelines to form a council. They seek to use the Reflection Pools to merge all timelines where they exist into one where they are god-[[Emperor.

### The Probability Compass

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*
- Always points toward the most favorable outcome
- Three times per day, can reroll any d20 roll
- Cursed: Sometimes shows what you want, not what's best

### Mirrors of Maybe

*Wondrous item, rare*
- Set of 7 hand mirrors, each showing different possibility
- Can communicate with alternate selves
- Breaking a mirror may trap you in that possibility

### The Certainty Stone

*Wondrous item, legendary*
- Makes one declared action inevitable
- Single use, then crumbles
- The action WILL happen, regardless of consequences

### Schrodinger's Box

*Wondrous item, uncommon*
- Contents exist in superposition until opened
- 50% chance of containing what you need most
- 50% chance of containing what you fear most

### The Truth of the Pools

Unknown to most, the Reflection Pools are not natural phenomena but prison cells. Each pool contains a trapped god from a timeline that was prevented from existing. The reflections are their attempts to escape into reality.

### The Thirteenth Pool's Purpose

The central pool doesn't show possibilities—it creates them. Every reflection that forms there becomes real somewhere. The Order of Mirrors actually works to prevent too many possibilities from spawning.

### The Price of Prophecy

Each prophecy made drains possibility from the future, making reality more rigid and predetermined. Too much divination could lock the timeline into an inescapable fate.

### [Key Locations]]
1. Main entrance/approach
2. Central gathering area
3. Important buildings/features
4. Defensive positions (if applicable)
5. Hidden or secret areas

### Running the Reflection Pools

**Preparation**:
- Create 3-5 alternate timelines for the campaign
- Prepare how major NPCs differ in each
- Consider what choices the PCs didn't make

**Showing Possibilities**:
- Be specific but not prescriptive
- Show consequences, not just events
- Make some possibilities clearly better/worse
- Include impossible but de[[Sired outcomes

**Managing Paradoxes**:
- Small paradoxes create minor inconveniences
- Medium paradoxes attract temporal predators
- Large paradoxes require divine intervention
- Campaign-ending paradoxes should be telegraphed
