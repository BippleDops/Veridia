## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing an adult or ancient green dragon's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Beast Spies.** Tiny Beasts magically gain the ability to understand Draconic and can communicate telepathically with the dragon while within 1 mile of the lair.  
- **Poisonous Thicket.** Ordinary plants growing within 1 mile of the lair poison the air around them. Whenever a creature other than the dragon or its allies finishes a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]] in that area, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition for 1 hour.  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

## Player-Facing Summary

Green dragon xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of green dragon xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around green dragon xmm.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
