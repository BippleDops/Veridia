Originally from a maritime merchant family, Reginald came to [[Aquabyssos]] thirty years ago as a trade representative and gradually evolved into a diplomatic specialist as relations between the realms became more complex. His success in preventing several potential conflicts through skilled negotiation earned him noble title and his current position as head of inter-realm diplomatic affairs.
