## Description
Among the simplest and most enchanting of tumbling accoutrements is the ladder of Elminster. By holding the top of the rails and leaning back, a dexterous bard can walk up the ladder, balancing the weight of it by drawing the ladder toward the chest. Then stepping over the top rung, the bard can descend down the other side. We offer the ladder in the beginner 5-foot height (5 sp), as well as the master 8-foot (7 gp), and the mage 10-foot (8 gp) ladders.

## Additional Details
requires Tumbling proficiency and 1 day practice; regular falling damage applies
