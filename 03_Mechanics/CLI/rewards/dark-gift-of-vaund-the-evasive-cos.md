# Dark Gift of Vaund the Evasive
*Charm*  

Vaund's gift is the power of evasion. This dark gift grants its beneficiary the benefits of an [amulet of proof against detection and location](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/amulet-of-proof-against-detection-and-location-xdmg.md) and a [ring of evasion](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/ring-of-evasion-xdmg.md). These benefits last for 10 days, after which the dark gift vanishes.

The beneficiary of this dark gift becomes twitchy and nervous, and also gains the following flaw: "I can't give a straight answer to any question put to me."
