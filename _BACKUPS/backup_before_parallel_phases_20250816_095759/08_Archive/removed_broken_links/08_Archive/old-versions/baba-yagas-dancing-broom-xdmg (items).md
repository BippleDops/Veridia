--- # Baba Yaga's Dancing Broom

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/baba-yagas-dancing-broom.webp#right) The archfey "Baba Yaga" crafted many of these magic brooms. No two appear exactly alike. While holding the broom, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic action to transform it into an [Animated Broom Xmm]] under your control. The broom then moves into an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The broom acts immediately after you on your [[Initiative Xphb count and remains animate until you take a [Action Xphb]] and use a command word to render it iimate. On your turn, you can mentally command the animated broom if it is within 30 feet of you and you don't have the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated condition (no action required). You decide what action the broom takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location. If the broom is reduced to 0 [hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]], it shatters and is destroyed. If the broom reverts to its iimate form before losing all its [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] it regains all of them. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 232* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Baba yagas dancing broom xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
