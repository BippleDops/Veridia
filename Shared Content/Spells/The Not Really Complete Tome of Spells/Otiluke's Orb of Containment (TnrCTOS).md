# Otiluke's Orb of Containment (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 100 gp, which is shattered when the spell is cast)

**Duration**: 1 day


## Effects
You create a container made of pure magical force, which forms around a substance of your choice, up to one pound. The container is completely unbreakable and inside of it, the object is held in stasis so it doesnâ€™t age. When the spell ends, the contents inside the orb are released.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases by an extra day for each slot level above 3rd.
