--- # Deep Mother Sanity System *"The mind breaks before the truth, but the truth remains."* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview The Deep Mother Sanity System tracks characters' mental stability when confronted with eldritch truths, reality distortions, and the existential horror of the Deep Mother's influence. Unlike traditional madness mechanics, this system recognizes that exposure to cosmic truth fundamentally changes how characters understand reality - sometimes this knowledge is beneficial, sometimes devastating, but it's always permanent. Nevertheless, ### Sanity Points

Characters have Sanity Points equal to their Wisdom score + their level (minimum 10). These represent their ability to maintain their current understanding of reality when faced with contradictory evidence. **Maximum Sanity**: Wisdom score + character level **Starting Sanity**: Maximum Sanity **Minimum Sanity**: Cannot drop below 0 ### Sanity Saves

When exposed to Deep Mother phenomena, characters make Sanity saves:
- **Attribute**: Wisdom-based save
- **Proficiency**: Add proficiency bonus if proficient in Wisdom saves
- **Success**: Take half damage (minimum 1)
- **Failure**: Take full sanity damage
- **Critical Failure (1)**: Take maximum damage + temporary madness
- **Critical Success (20)**: Take no damage + gain insight ### Temporary Madness (`dice: 1d4` hours)

Triggered by critical failures on sanity saves: | d20 | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| 1-2 | **Denial**: Cannot acknowledge supernatural events occurred |
| 3-4 | **Paranoia**: Everyone is secretly working for Deep Mother |
| 5-6 | **Compulsion**: Must document everything obsessively |
| 7-8 | **Catatonia**: Frozen by overwhelming impossibility |
| 9-10 | **Hypervigilance**: Cannot rest, constantly scanning for threats |
| 11-12 | **Regression**: Becomes child-like, seeks comfort |
| 13-14 | **Aggression**: Violently rejects anything "unnatural" |
| 15-16 | **Dissociation**: Watches own actions as if observing someone else |
| 17-18 | **Echolalia**: Can only repeat last thing heard |
| 19-20 | **Truth Telling**: Compulsively speaks only absolute truth | ### Indefinite Madness (Until cured)

Triggered by losing 50% of current sanity in single event: | d20 | Madness | Mechanical Effect |
|-----|---------|-------------------|
| 1-2 | **Depth Obsession** | Must spend 4+ hours daily near water or take 1 sanity damage |
| 3-4 | **Prophetic Dreams** | Each long rest, gain vision of possible future (DM's choice) |
| 5-6 | **Memory Gaps** | Cannot form new long-term memories without constant effort |
| 7-8 | **Reality Doubt** | Treats all Illusion spells as if real |
| 9-10 | **Invisible Watchers** | Convinced entities constantly observe, acts accordingly |
| 11-12 | **Temporal Displacement** | Sometimes acts based on memories from other timelines |
| 13-14 | **Speaking in Depths** | Can only communicate through water metaphors |
| 15-16 | **Touch Aversion** | Cannot tolerate physical contact without panic |
| 17-18 | **Number Fixation** | Obsessed with specific number, sees it everywhere |
| 19-20 | **Split Personality** | Second personality knows things the first doesn't | ### Permanent Madness (Cannot be cured)

Triggered by reaching 0 sanity and returning: | d20 | Permanent Change | Effect |
|-----|------------------|--------|
| 1-3 | **Cosmic Perspective** | Cannot care about "small" problems (personal relationships, money, politics) |
| 4-6 | **Dream Logic** | Accepts impossibilities as normal, confuses metaphor with reality |
| 7-9 | **Temporal Awareness** | Sometimes knows things that haven't happened yet |
| 10-12 | **Deep Mother's Voice** | Occasionally speaks with her words/knowledge |
| 13-15 | **Reality Sensitivity** | Physically pained by lies, illusions, or logical inconsistencies |
| 16-18 | **Existential Numbness** | Cannot feel fear, joy, or surprise - only mild interest |
| 19-20 | **Living Prophecy** | Random statements become literally true within 24 hours | ### Sanity Immunity

Characters with 0 sanity become immune to further sanity loss but gain otherworldly awareness:
- See through all illusions automatically - Detect lies and deceptions instantly
- Know when reality breaches occur within 10 miles
- Understand the true names of eldritch entities
- Cannot be surprised by supernatural events ### Prophetic Madness

Characters at very low sanity (1-9 points) gain prophetic abilities:
- **Visions**: DM provides one true vision per day about future events
- **Warning Sense**: Advantage on initiative when supernatural threats appear - **Truth Sight**: Can see through Deep Mother cultist disguises
- **Dream Communication**: Can send messages through the dream realm ### Cosmic Enlightenment

Some characters embrace their sanity loss and gain positive benefits:
- **Eldritch Scholar**: Lower sanity threshold for learning forbidden knowledge
- **Reality Walker**: Can navigate reality breaches safely
- **Deep Speaker**: Communicate with Deep Mother entities without immediate harm
- **Paradox Resolver**: Understand and explain supernatural events to others ### Influence Correlation

As Deep Mother's influence grows, sanity becomes harder to maintain: | Deep Mother Influence | Sanity Save Modifier |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| 0-20% | Normal |
| 21-40% | -1 to all sanity saves |
| 41-60% | -2 to all sanity saves | | 61-80% | -3 to all sanity saves |
| 81-99% | -4 to all sanity saves |
| 100% | Automatic failure | ### Avatar Encounters

Each avatar type causes specific sanity damage: | Avatar | Save DC | Damage | Special Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|----------------|
| Drowned Queen | 18 | `dice: 2d6` | Temporary aquatic madness |
| Parasitic Mass | 19 | `dice: 2d6`+2 | Risk of parasitic infection |
| Crystal Heart | 17 | `dice: 2d6` | Crystallization obsession |
| Void Prophet | 22 | `dice: 3d6` | Prophetic overload |
| Final Form | 25 | `dice: 4d6` | Immediate transcendence | ### Cult Indoctrination

Willing exposure to Deep Mother influence can reduce sanity damage:
- **Outer Circle**: -2 to sanity damage from minor exposure
- **Fourth Circle**: -3 to sanity damage from moderate exposure - **Third Circle**: -4 to sanity damage from major exposure
- **Second Circle**: Immune to sanity damage from willing exposure
- **Inner Circle**: Gain sanity points from cosmic revelations ### Sanity as Resource

Treat sanity as expendable resource for power:
- Voluntarily lose sanity to boost spell save DCs
- Trade sanity for prophetic knowledge
- Sacrifice sanity to power reality-altering effects
- Use madness states as temporary supernatural abilities ### Group Sanity

Track party's collective mental health:
- **Stable Group**: All members above 50% - bonus to group checks
- **Unstable Group**: Mixed sanity levels - internal conflicts
- **Mad Group**: All members below 25% - dangerous but insightful
- **Lost Group**: NPCs, but potentially useful allies ### Sanity Economy

Create systems where sanity has value:
- Information brokers accept sanity as payment
- Magical items powered by madness
- NPCs provide services in exchange for "interesting perspectives"
- Cosmic entities bargain for human mental energy ### Warning Signs

Players should recognize when their character approaches dangerous sanity levels and make informed decisions about risk vs reward. ## Player-Facing Summary Deep Mother Sanity System is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Deep Mother Sanity System as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Deep Mother Sanity System. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A noble needs help stealing before the festival
