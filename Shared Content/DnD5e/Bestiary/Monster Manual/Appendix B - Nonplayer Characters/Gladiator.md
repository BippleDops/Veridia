## Special Traits
***Brave.*** The gladiator has advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

***Brute.*** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the gladiator hits with it (included in the attack).

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The gladiator makes three melee attacks or two ranged attacks.

***Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. and range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (`dice: 2d6+4`) piercing damage, or 13 (`dice: 2d8+4`) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Shield Bash.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (`dice: 2d4+4`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

## Reactions
***Parry.*** The gladiator adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the gladiator must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

## Description
Gladiators battle for the entertainment of raucous crowds. Some gladiators are brutal pit fighters who treat each match as a life-or-death struggle, while others are professional duelists who command huge fees but rarely fight to the death.
