For 1 minute, you know the direction of the nearest creature [[hostile attitude xphb|Hostile]] to you within 60 feet, but not its distance from you. The wand can sense the presence of [[hostile attitude xphb|Hostile]] creatures that are [[conditions#Invisible|Invisible]], ethereal, disguised, or hidden, as well as those in plain sight. The effect ends if you stop holding the wand.
