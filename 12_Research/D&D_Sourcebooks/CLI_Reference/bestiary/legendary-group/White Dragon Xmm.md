## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing an adult or ancient white dragon's lair is affected by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Frigid Cold.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is an area of [[extreme-cold-xdmg (traps-hazards)]]. Any water in that area is [[Frigid Water Xdmg]]. See the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for rules on extreme cold and frigid water.  
- **Glacial Gloom.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is [[lightly-obscured-xphb (variant-rules)]] by chilly fog. Whenever a creature other than the dragon or one of its allies finishes a [[long-rest-xphb]] in that area, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its [[Fly Speed Xphb]] reduced by 10 feet for 1 hour.  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

## Player-Facing Summary

White dragon xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of white dragon xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around white dragon xmm.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
