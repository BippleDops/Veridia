# Erase (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *1st-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You magically remove one set of writings you can see, up to one page’s worth at a time. This automatically removes nonmagical writings. If you are attempting to remove magical writing, including spells such as *glyph of warding* or *symbol*, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a successful check, the writing is erased.

This spell does not work on illusory writing, such as that produced by *illusory script*, as that writing isn’t real.
