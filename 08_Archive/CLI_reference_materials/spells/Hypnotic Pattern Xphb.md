# Hypnotic Pattern
*3rd-level, Illusion*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a pinch of confetti)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a twisting pattern of colors in a 30-foot [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb|Cube]] within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who can see the pattern must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] condition for the duration. While [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Charmed|Charmed]], the creature has the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] condition and a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb|Speed]] of 0.

The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
