# Starry Wisp
*cantrip, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You launch a mote of light at one creature or object within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `d8` Radiant damage, and until the end of your next turn, it emits [[dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] in a 10-foot radius and can't benefit from the [[conditions#Invisible|Invisible]] condition.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by `d8` when you reach levels 5 (`2d8`), 11 (`3d8`), and 17 (`4d8`).
