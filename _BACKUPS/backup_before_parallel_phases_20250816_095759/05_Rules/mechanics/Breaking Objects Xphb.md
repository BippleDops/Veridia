--- # Breaking Objects

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 362. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* Objects can be harmed by attacks and by some spells, using the rules below. If an object is exceedingly fragile, the DM may allow a creature to break it automatically with the [[actions#Attack|Attack or [actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Armor Class The Object [[armor-class-xphb (variant-rules) table suggests ACs for various substances. **Object Armor Class** | AC | Substance |

|----|-----------|
| 11 | Cloth, paper, rope |
| 13 | Crystal, glass, ice |
| 15 | Wood |
| 17 | Stone |
| 19 | Iron, steel |
| 21 | Mithral |
| 23 | Adamantite |

^object-armor-class ## Hit Points An object is destroyed when it has 0 Hit Points. The Object Hit Points table suggests [hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller. To track Hit Points for a Huge or Gargantuan object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section's [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules) separately. The DM determines whether destroying part of an object causes the whole thing to collapse. **Object Hit Points** | Size | Fragile | Resilient |

|------|---------|-----------|
| Tiny (bottle, lock) | 2 (`d4`) | 5 (``dice: 2d4``) |
| Small (chest, lute) | 3 (`d6`) | 10 (``dice: 3d6``) |
| Medium (barrel, chandelier) | 4 (`d8`) | 18 (``dice: 4d8``) |
| Large (cart, dining table) | 5 (`d10`) | 27 (``dice: 5d10``) |

^object-hit-points ## Damage Types and Objects Objects have [immunity-xphb (variant-rules)]] to Poison and Psychic damage. The DM might decide that some [[Damage Types are more or less effective against an object. For example, Bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting. Paper or cloth objects might have [Vulnerability Xphb]] to Fire damage. ## Damage Threshold Big objects, such as castle walls, often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. ## No Ability Scores An object lacks ability scores unless a rule assigns scores to the object. Without ability scores, an object can't make ability checks, and it fails all saving throws. ## Player-Facing Summary Breaking objects xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of breaking objects xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around breaking objects xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Second Prophecy of Depths ## Plot Hooks - Strange accidents suggest a conspiracy
