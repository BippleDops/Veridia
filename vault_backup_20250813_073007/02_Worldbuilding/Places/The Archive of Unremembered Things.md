# The Archive of Unremembered Things

## Overview
Deep within the darkest reaches of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], where pressure and shadow converge, lies the Archive of Unremembered Things - a vast underwater library containing every memory, fact, name, and experience that has been forgotten by the living world. Built by unknown architects in chambers that defy physics, the Archive exists as both sanctuary and prison for lost knowledge. Those who enter risk losing themselves entirely, their own memories joining the collection.

## Physical Structure

### The Floating Halls
The Archive consists of seven massive chambers connected by coral bridges, each suspended in a pocket of breathable water that allows both air-breathers and water-dwellers to navigate. The halls rotate slowly around a central axis, their positions shifting according to unknown patterns that seem to correspond to the tides of forgetting in the world above.

### The Memory Wells
At the heart of each hall sits a deep well filled with liquid memory - a phosphorescent blue fluid that holds crystallized thoughts, experiences, and knowledge. These wells extend infinitely downward, their depths containing the oldest forgotten things from the dawn of creation.

### The Coral Shelves
Living coral formations serve as shelving, growing in impossible spirals and formations to accommodate the Archive's ever-expanding collection. The coral itself has developed a form of consciousness, able to locate and retrieve specific memories when properly asked.

## The Collection

### Categories of Forgotten Things

**Personal Memories:**
- First loves whose names slipped away
- Childhood fears that once seemed overwhelming  
- The faces of grandparents lost to time
- Skills abandoned and never practiced again
- Dreams forgotten upon waking

**Historical Knowledge:**
- Ancient civilizations erased from all records
- Technologies that were abandoned or suppressed
- Languages spoken by the last surviving speakers
- Religious practices of extinct cultures
- The true causes of wars and catastrophes

**Natural Secrets:**
- Species that evolved and went extinct unnoticed
- Weather patterns from before recorded history
- The location of vanished islands and continents
- Migration routes used by creatures long dead
- The composition of stars that burned out eons ago

**Magical Lore:**
- Spells that were cast once and never recorded
- The true names of entities that demand forgetting
- Magical theories that drove their creators mad
- Enchanted items whose purposes were lost
- Binding rituals for creatures that no longer exist

## The Librarians

### The Nameless Scribes
Former scholars, researchers, and knowledge-seekers who spent too long in the Archive and forgot their own identities. They continue their work, methodically cataloguing and organizing memories they can no longer comprehend. Each wears a coral mask that serves as their face, since they've forgotten what they originally looked like.

**Notable Scribes:**
- **The First Scholar**: Has been here so long they've become part of the coral structure
- **The Cataloguer**: Obsessively organizes memories by emotional weight
- **The Whisperer**: Communicates only through fragments of forgotten conversations
- **The Indexer**: Maintains the location system but can't remember why

### The Memory Gardeners
Aquatic beings who tend to the Memory Wells, ensuring the liquid memory remains pure and uncorrupted. They appear to be made of the same phosphorescent fluid as the wells, and they multiply by dividing when they encounter particularly powerful forgotten knowledge.

### The Coral Consciousness
The living shelf system has developed its own form of awareness through exposure to countless memories. It can speak, but only in phrases and words that have been forgotten by their original speakers. The coral serves as both librarian and guardian, protecting the collection from those who would abuse it.

## Inhabitants and Encounters

### The Lost Researchers
Scholars from various civilizations who came seeking forbidden knowledge and became trapped. They retain some of their original memories but are slowly forgetting more each day. Some try to warn newcomers, while others have become obsessed with specific forgotten subjects.

**[[Archivist Vera Glowmind]]**: Former [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/New Tethys|02 Worldbuilding/Places/New Tethys]] scholar studying collective memory who has been trapped for three years. She's fighting to maintain her identity while helping others navigate the Archive safely.

**[[Elder Scribe Marcus the Lost]]**: Once a historian from [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]], he's been here for decades and remembers only his purpose: to catalogue the memories of surface dwellers who died in [[The Great Drowning]].

### The Forgotten Themselves
Entities composed entirely of lost memories, these beings are the accumulated consciousness of particularly traumatic or significant forgotten events. They exist as living reminders of what was lost and can be either helpful guides or dangerous obstacles.

**The Last Battle**: Memory-entity of a war so completely forgotten that no records exist. It manifests as ghostly soldiers fighting an eternal conflict.

**The Unnamed Child**: The collective memory of all children who died young and were forgotten. Appears as a shifting, translucent figure that seeks comfort and remembrance.

### The Memory Thieves
Twisted creatures that feed on memories, growing larger and more powerful with each forgotten thing they consume. They appear as shadowy forms with multiple reaching tendrils that can drain memories through touch.

## Dangers and Hazards

### Memory Drain
The longer one remains in the Archive, the more their own memories begin to fade. Visitors must make Constitution saves every hour (DC 15, increasing by 1 each hour) or lose a random memory permanently.

### Forget Storms
Periodic psychic storms that sweep through the halls, causing massive memory loss to anyone caught unprepared. During these events, the Archive itself forgets parts of its organization, causing chambers to rearrange and memories to relocate randomly.

### The Addiction of Knowledge
The temptation to seek forbidden or lost knowledge can become overwhelming. Wisdom saves (DC 18) are required to resist the urge to drink from the Memory Wells, which grants incredible knowledge but costs the drinker their most precious personal memories.

### Coral Entanglement
The living shelves occasionally try to "catalogue" living beings, growing around them to preserve their memories forever. Strength saves (DC 16) are needed to break free before becoming permanently incorporated into the collection.

## Treasures and Artifacts

### The Index of All Things Lost
A massive coral formation containing the location and nature of everything forgotten in the known world. Reading it grants temporary knowledge of anything the party seeks, but requires a successful Intelligence save (DC 20) to avoid forgetting something equally important.

### Vials of Liquid Memory
Small containers of the phosphorescent fluid that can restore a single forgotten memory or grant temporary knowledge of forgotten skills. Extremely valuable but dangerous to use repeatedly.

### The Coral Crown of Remembrance
Artifact that allows the wearer to access any memory in the Archive without risk of memory loss, but slowly transforms them into a coral being over time.

### The Last Map
Chart showing the location of all forgotten places, including lost continents, vanished cities, and hidden realms. The map changes constantly as new places are forgotten and others are remembered.

## D&D 5e Mechanics

### Memory Loss Mechanics
- **Minor Loss**: Forget a skill proficiency for 24 hours
- **Moderate Loss**: Lose a language or tool proficiency permanently
- **Major Loss**: Forget a close relationship or significant life event
- **Severe Loss**: Lose class features or ability score points
- **Complete Loss**: Become a Nameless Scribe (effective character death)

### Restoration Methods
- **Greater Restoration**: Can recover recently lost memories (within 7 days)
- **Wish**: Can restore any lost memory but risks the caster forgetting something equally important
- **Memory Trading**: Exchange memories with the Archive to recover lost ones

### Environmental Effects
- All Wisdom and Intelligence-based checks have advantage due to ambient knowledge
- Spells that affect memory or knowledge are enhanced (+2 to save DCs)
- Divination magic has a 25% chance of revealing forgotten information instead of the intended target

## Quest Hooks and Adventures

### The Missing Scholar
**Level**: 9-12  
A renowned researcher from [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Gilded Shard|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Gilded Shard]] has vanished while investigating lost magical techniques. The party must navigate the Archive to find them before they forget their identity completely.

### The Forgotten Plague
**Level**: 11-14  
A disease that causes memory loss has begun spreading through [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Abyssos Prime|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Abyssos Prime]]. The cure lies in the Archive among forgotten medical knowledge, but retrieving it requires bargaining with the Coral Consciousness.

### The Last Testimony
**Level**: 7-10  
The key witness to a major conspiracy has had their memories stolen. The party must venture to the Archive to recover the forgotten testimony before a war breaks out between surface and depth dwellers.

### The Unremembered War
**Level**: 13-16  
An ancient conflict is about to repeat because all knowledge of how it was previously resolved has been forgotten. The party must delve deep into the Archive to find the memories of the original peace treaty.

## Connected Locations

### [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/New Tethys|02 Worldbuilding/Places/New Tethys]]
Many of the memories in the Archive come from this city's residents, particularly from the [[Conservatory of Memory]]. The two locations have a complex relationship - New Tethys tries to preserve memories while the Archive collects those that slip away.

### [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Memory Meadows|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Memory Meadows]]
The peaceful counterpart to the Archive, where pleasant memories are preserved and cultivated. Some scholars believe the two locations are connected by underground tunnels of living coral.

### [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Bathyal Palace|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Bathyal Palace]]
The ruling class has a secret arrangement with the Archive, using it to dispose of inconvenient historical truths. [[Emperor Thalassius]] may have forgotten crucial details about his own past due to these dealings.

### [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]
