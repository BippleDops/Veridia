## Description

Though deathlocks exist to serve their patrons, they retain some freedom when it comes to devising tactics and carrying out plans. Powerful deathlocks recruit lesser creatures to help them carry out their missions, becoming the masterminds behind vast conspiracies and intrigues that culminate in the accomplishment of great acts of evil.

**Deathlocks.** The forging of a pact between a warlock and a patron is no minor occasionâ€”at least not for the warlock. The consequences of breaking that pact can be dire and, in some cases, lethal. A warlock who fails to live up to a bargain with an evil patron runs the risk of rising from the dead as a deathlock, a foul Undead driven to serve its otherworldly patron.

An powerful necromancer might also discover the wicked methods of creating a deathlock and then subjugate it, acting as the deathlock's patron.
