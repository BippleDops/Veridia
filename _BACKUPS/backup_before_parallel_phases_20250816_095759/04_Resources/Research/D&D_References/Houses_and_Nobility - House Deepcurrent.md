â€” House Deepcurrent family motto (unofficial extended version) ## Player-Facing Summary House Deepcurrent is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of House Deepcurrent as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around House Deepcurrent. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology.
