# Rime's Binding Ice
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-feet cone)
- **Components:** S, a vial of meltwater
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A burst of cold energy emanates from you in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 cold damage and is hindered by ice formations for 1 minute, or until it or another creature within reach of it uses an action to break away the ice. A creature hindered by ice has its speed reduced to 0. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't hindered by ice.

**Classes**: Fighter (Eldritch Knight), Sorcerer, Wizard
