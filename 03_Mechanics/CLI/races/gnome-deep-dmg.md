### Innate Spellcasting

You have an innate ability to cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

- **1/day each.** [blindness/deafness](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/blindness-deafness-xphb.md), [blur](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/blur-xphb.md), [disguise self](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self-xphb.md)  

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

### Stone Camouflage

You have advantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Stealth)) checks to hide in rocky terrain.

### Gnome Cunning

You have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.

### Superior Darkvision

Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Gnomish, Terran, and Undercommon.
