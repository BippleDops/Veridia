# Mourning Depths

## Secrets and Hidden Aspects

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Soul Anchor
> Deep beneath the memorial complex lies an ancient artifact called the Soul Anchor, which actually prevents the souls of the dead from moving on to their final rest. [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Keeper of Sorrows Tidal Memento]] discovered this centuries ago and has been maintaining the artifact because it allows limited communication with the dead and provides comfort to the grieving. However, the growing number of trapped souls is beginning to cause supernatural instabilities, and some souls are becoming restless and potentially dangerous. The Keeper is torn between revealing the truth and losing the comfort the artifact provides to the community.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Living Memorial
> Some of the memorial coral reefs have developed a form of collective consciousness that retains memories and personalities from those buried within them. These "Living Memorials" can communicate with sensitive individuals and provide wisdom from the dead, but they're also developing their own agenda and desires. They want to expand beyond their current boundaries and are subtly influencing marine life and even some Order members to help them grow. They see themselves as the next evolution of life and death, but their expansion could threaten the natural marine ecosystem.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Grief Harvest
> An ancient entity known as the Sorrow Feeder has been drawn to the Mourning Depths by the concentrated grief and sorrow. It feeds on intense emotional pain and has been subtly manipulating events to increase the amount of grief generated at the site. It influences some memorial services to be more traumatic, prevents some people from healing properly, and even occasionally causes "accidents" that result in more deaths and grief. The entity is becoming stronger and more bold in its manipulations, and may soon be powerful enough to directly attack the living to increase the amount of sorrow it can consume.
