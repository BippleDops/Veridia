# Ice Storm
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 300 feet

- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Hail falls in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [[Area of Effect Xphb]] centered on a point within range. Each creature in the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `2d10` Bludgeoning damage and `4d6` Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Hailstones turn ground in the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] into [[Difficult Terrain Xphb]] until the end of your next turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The Bludgeoning damage increases by `d10` for each spell slot level above 4.

**Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]
