Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Character Creation Guide as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Character Creation Guide. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Plot Hooks - A document has gone missing and war looms - Strange accidents suggest a curse
- A prisoner has gone missing and chaos spreads ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## Stats```statblock creature: Custom NPC```### Quick Stats - **AC**: *[Armor Class]*
