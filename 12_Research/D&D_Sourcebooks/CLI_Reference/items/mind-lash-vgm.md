# Mind Lash
*Melee weapon, rare (requires attunement by a mind flayer)*  


- **Damage**: 1d4 slashing
- **Properties**: [[item-properties#Finesse|Finesse]], [[item-properties#Reach|Reach]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

In the hands of any creature other than a [[mind-flayer-xmm|mind flayer]], a mind lash functions as a normal whip. In the hands of an illithid, this magic weapon strips away a creature's will to survive as it also strips away flesh, dealing an extra `2d4` psychic damage to any target it hits. Any creature that takes psychic damage from the mind lash must also succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
