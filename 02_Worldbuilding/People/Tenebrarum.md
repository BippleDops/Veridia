## Overview
Tenebrarum is the official ambassador from the Void Realms to [[Aquabyssos]], representing entities that exist in the spaces between reality. Neither malevolent nor benevolent from mortal perspectives, they conduct diplomacy for beings whose very existence challenges conventional understanding of life, death, and meaning. Their embassy exists in a pocket of controlled nothingness within the Deep Parliament District, where they negotiate treaties that most senators don't fully understand.
