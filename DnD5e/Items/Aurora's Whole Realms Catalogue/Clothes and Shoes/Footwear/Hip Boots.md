## Description
Originally designed and worn by fishermen in the shallow reaches of the Moonsea, these “pants” are constructed of leather and sealed in [[Glue|pitch]] to make them watertight. Also known as waders, they are quite useful in shallow-water activities for folk who prefer not to get wet. We sell them for 15 gp, and they come in brown or black. Retarring of old waders costs a mere 3 sp and requires two days for service.
