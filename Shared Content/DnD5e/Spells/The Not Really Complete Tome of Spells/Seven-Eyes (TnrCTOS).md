You conjure seven magical orbs that float about your head in a ring five feet in diameter. For the duration, you have advantage on all Wisdom (Perception) ability checks that rely on sight, you gain 360°-vision, and you gain truesight with a range of 60 feet.

Each eye has two additional abilities: First, you can use your action to use one eye can cast a spell as if you were using a 7th-level spell slot. Secondly, the eyes can protect you from an attack, without you needing to use an action. Each eye can only be used once to either attack or defend once, after which it vanishes. The seven eyes are as follows:

♦ ***Eye of the Mind.*** If you are attacked by a spell that would charm or paralyze you, you can choose to have the eye absorb that spell. You can also use the eye to cast *charm person*.

♦ ***Eye of the Sword.*** If you are attacked by a physical melee or ranged weapon, you can choose to have the eye take the blow it-self. You can also have the eye cast *magic mis-sile*.

♦ ***Eye of the Mage.*** If you are attacked by a spell that inflicts acid, cold, fire, force, or lightning damage, you can choose to have the eye absorb that spell. You can also use the eye to cast *lightning bolt*.

♦ ***Eye of Venom.*** If you are attacked by anything that inflicts poison damage or the poisoned condition, you can choose to have the eye absorb the poison. You can also use the eye to cast *poison spray*, using your level to determine the damage.

♦ ***Eye of the Soul.*** If you are attacked by anything that inflicts necrotic damage, you can choose to have the eye absorb the damage. You can also use the eye to cast *inflict wounds.*

♦ ***Eye of Artifice.*** If you are attacked by an affect from a rod, staff, wand, or ring, you can choose to have the eye absorb the damage. You can also use the eye to cast *dispel magic*.

♦ ***Eye of Stone.*** If you are attacked by an effect that can petrify you, you can choose to have the eye absorb the effect. You can also use the eye to cast *hold person.*
