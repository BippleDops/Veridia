# The Azure Coast

*The Golden Shore of Maritime Commerce*

## Overview

The Azure Coast stretches along the western edge of [[12_Research/D&D_References/Aethermoor]], forming the continent's primary maritime frontier and its most prosperous trading region. Named for the distinctive blue-tinted waters created by underwater crystal formations, this 400-mile coastline serves as the main interface between the surface world and the underwater realm of [[12_Research/D&D_References/Aquabyssos]].

From the great port city of [[12_Research/D&D_References/Port Meridian]] in the north to the lighthouse settlements of the southern capes, the Azure Coast represents both opportunity and danger. Here, surface merchants trade with underwater diplomats, pirates prey upon wealthy cargo vessels, and ancient ruins emerge from the tides during the lowest waters of the season.
