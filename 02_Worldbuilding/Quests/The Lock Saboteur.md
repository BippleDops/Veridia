# The Lock Saboteur

**Type:** Infiltration/Sabotage Prevention  
**Level:** 10-14  
**Location:** [[The Lock]], [[Pressure's End]], [[The Hadal Depths]]  
**Duration:** 2-3 sessions  
**Threat:** Someone is sabotaging the most important barrier protecting [[Aquabyssos]] from abyssal horrors

## Overview
[[The Lock]] - the massive arcane barrier holding back the creatures of [[The Hadal Depths]] - has begun showing signs of systematic sabotage. Power fluctuations, missing security personnel, and disturbing whispers in the deep suggest an inside job. If the Lock fails completely, the horrors beneath will surge upward and consume all of [[Aquabyssos]].

## Background
[[Admiral Thorne Blackwater]] first noticed unusual readings from the Lock's monitoring stations. What seemed like normal degradation revealed itself as deliberate tampering when [[Vault Keeper Eternal]] found crystalline components that had been carefully weakened rather than naturally worn. Someone with intimate knowledge of the Lock's construction is methodically destroying it from within.

## Key NPCs
- **[[Vault Keeper Eternal]]**: Ancient guardian of the Lock, growing desperate as sabotage accelerates
- **[[Engineer Brass Gearspin]]**: Lead technician, one of few who understand Lock mechanics completely
- **[[Temple Guardian Marcus the Drowned]]**: Fanatical priest who believes the Lock defies divine will
- **[[Time-Lost Delegate Chronus]]**: Has witnessed the Lock's failure in other timelines
- **[[Admiral Thorne Blackwater]]**: Military commander coordinating the investigation

## Investigation Phase

### Phase 1: Understanding the Lock (1 session)
**Location:** [[The Lock]] - Surface Systems  
**Objective:** Learn how the Lock functions and identify sabotage patterns

**The Lock's Structure:**
- **Crystalline Core**: Seven massive [[Seven Shards]] fragments channeling barrier energy
- **Pressure Systems**: Mechanical components maintaining structural integrity
- **Ritual Chambers**: Ongoing ceremonies that reinforce magical bindings
- **Monitoring Network**: Sensory apparatus detecting threats from below
- **Emergency Protocols**: Last-resort systems for catastrophic failure

**Evidence of Sabotage:**
1. **Micro-fractures**: Crystalline supports show tool marks, not wear patterns
2. **Ritual Disruption**: Sacred ceremonies interrupted by "equipment failures"
3. **Missing Personnel**: Three technicians vanished during routine maintenance
4. **Modified Components**: Replacement parts deliberately weakened before installation
5. **Memory Gaps**: Staff experiencing unexplained lapses in recollection

### Phase 2: Deep Investigation (1 session)
**Location:** [[The Lock]] - Lower Levels, [[Pressure's End]]  
**Objective:** Identify the saboteur and their methods

**Suspects to Investigate:**
- **[[Engineer Brass Gearspin]]**: Has complete access and technical knowledge
- **[[Temple Guardian Marcus the Drowned]]**: Religious extremist with philosophical motive
- **New Technician "Coral"**: Recent hire with suspicious background
- **[[Memory Farmers]] Agent**: Could be erasing evidence of their infiltration
- **Deep Cultist**: Someone corrupted by exposure to abyssal influence

**Investigation Methods:**
- **Technical Analysis**: Examine sabotage techniques for signature patterns
- **Personnel Records**: Background checks reveal hidden connections
- **Memory Examination**: Magical investigation of staff amnesia
- **Temporal Analysis**: [[Time-Lost Delegate Chronus]] can detect timeline manipulations
- **Deep Sensing**: Psychic detection of abyssal corruption in personnel

## The Truth Revealed

### The Real Saboteur: Engineer Brass Gearspin
**Motivation:** Believes the Lock is slowly poisoning [[Aquabyssos]] with leaking abyssal energy  
**Method:** Using his access to gradually weaken the barrier in "safe" ways  
**Goal:** Force evacuation to surface before the accumulated corruption kills everyone  
**Corruption Level:** 60% - partially influenced by abyssal whispers but still rational

**His Plan:**
1. **Controlled Failure**: Create manageable breaches that prove the Lock's danger
2. **Evidence Collection**: Document corruption effects on deep-dwelling citizens
3. **Mass Evacuation**: Convince authorities to relocate population to safety
4. **Selective Destruction**: Destroy the Lock only after people are safe

### Moral Complexity
Brass Gearspin isn't evil - he's genuinely trying to save lives based on disturbing evidence:
- **Pressure Sickness** rates increasing annually
- **Memory degradation** in long-term deep residents
- **Genetic mutations** appearing in newborns near the Lock
- **Psychological disorders** correlating with proximity to abyssal energies

## Phase 3: The Confrontation (1 session)
**Location:** [[The Lock]] - Core Chamber  
**Objective:** Stop the sabotage while addressing legitimate concerns

### Brass Gearspin's Final Gambit
When confronted, Brass reveals his master plan: a "controlled detonation" of the Lock's primary systems that will:
- Create obvious danger requiring evacuation
- Preserve enough barrier function to prevent total catastrophe
- Force authorities to find alternative solutions
- Save lives by removing people from slow corruption

**The Choice:**
- **Stop Him**: Maintain the Lock but ignore growing health crisis
- **Help Him**: Risk catastrophic failure for chance at real solution
- **Find Alternative**: Seek third option that addresses both problems

## Combat Encounter: Desperate Engineer

### Brass Gearspin (Corrupted)
**CR 9** (5,000 XP)  
**Abilities:**
- **Technical Mastery**: Can control Lock systems to create environmental hazards
- **Abyssal Whispers**: Shares disturbing visions of the future with enemies
- **Jury-Rigged Explosives**: Uses improvised devices with devastating effect
- **Corruption Shield**: Abyssal energy provides resistance to damage
- **Desperate Gambit**: When below half health, begins emergency Lock shutdown

**Tactics:** Uses the Lock's own systems as weapons while trying to complete his sabotage

### Environmental Hazards
- **Power Fluctuations**: Random electrical damage throughout the chamber
- **Gravitational Anomalies**: Areas where the Lock's magic creates dangerous effects
- **Abyssal Leakage**: Pools of corrupting energy that cause madness
- **Structural Collapse**: Brass's sabotage causes ceiling and walls to crumble
- **Emergency Lockdown**: Blast doors seal, creating time pressure

## Resolution Paths

### Option 2: Collaborative Solution (Investigation Focus)
**Outcome:** Work with Brass to find safer way to address his concerns
- **Research Initiative**: Major study of Lock's health effects begins
- **Gradual Improvement**: Modified barrier reduces harmful emissions
- **Public Awareness**: Controlled revelation leads to health monitoring
- **Long-term Success**: Engineered solution protects both safety and health

### Option 3: Controlled Evacuation (Social Focus)

> [!danger] DM Secret
> The Lock was never meant to be permanent. It's a stopgap measure created during an ancient emergency, and it's slowly destabilizing reality itself. Brass Gearspin is partially right - the Lock will eventually fail catastrophically, but his timeline is off by centuries. The real question is whether society should begin preparing for that eventuality now or wait until the crisis becomes undeniable.
