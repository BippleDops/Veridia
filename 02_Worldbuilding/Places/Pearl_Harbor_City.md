# Pearl Harbor City
*Gateway Between Worlds*

## Overview

Pearl Harbor City stands as Aquathys's primary connection to the surface world, a bustling metropolis built within a massive underwater dome that maintains variable pressure zones. The city exists in a constant state of controlled chaos as traders, smugglers, diplomats, and adventurers from both above and below the waves converge here.

## Geography

### Districts
