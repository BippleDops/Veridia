# Feinting Attack
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 95*  

As a [[Action Xphb]], you can expend one Superiority Die to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of yourself as your target. You have [[Advantage Xphb]] on your next attack roll against that target this turn. If that attack hits, add the Superiority Die to the attack's damage roll.
