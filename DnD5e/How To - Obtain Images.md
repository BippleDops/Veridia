# How To: Obtain Images

A large portion of the images required in these files are not kept here due to the massive size requirements. If we hosted them all here then your own personal vaults would quickly also blow out. This will cause you issues with backups. 

Links are provided below to places that already host the images. You should download the images you wish to use and place them anywhere in your vault. We recommend you put them in an assest folder such as z_Assets. 

GitHub does not natively support the downloading of specific folders within a Repo. As such you need to use this tool: https://download-directory.github.io/
Paste the folder URL per your desired content into the tool.
