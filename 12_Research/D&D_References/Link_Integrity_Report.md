# üîó Link Integrity Report
*Tracking Unresolved Links and Orphaned Pages*

## Overview
This dashboard monitors link health across the vault, identifying broken references and isolated pages that need connection.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Unresolved Links (Last 30 Days)

```dataview
TABLE file.link as "Source", length(file.outlinks) as "Total Links", length(filter(file.outlinks, (x) => !x.file)) as "Broken"
FROM ""
WHERE length(filter(file.outlinks, (x) => !x.file)) > 0
AND file.mtime > date(today) - dur(30 days)
SORT length(filter(file.outlinks, (x) => !x.file)) DESC
LIMIT 20
```

## üèùÔ∏è Orphaned Pages (No Incoming Links)

```dataview
TABLE file.link as "Orphaned Page", file.mtime as "Last Modified", length(file.tags) as "Tags"
FROM ""
WHERE length(file.inlinks) = 0
AND !contains(file.path, "Templates")
AND !contains(file.path, "Archive")
AND file.name != this.file.name
SORT file.mtime DESC
LIMIT 20
```

## üìä Link Statistics by Category

```dataview
TABLE 
    length(rows.file.link) as "Total Files",
    sum(rows.outlinks) as "Total Outgoing",
    sum(rows.inlinks) as "Total Incoming",
    round(sum(rows.outlinks) / length(rows.file.link), 2) as "Avg Out/File"
FROM ""
WHERE contains(file.path, "Worldbuilding")
GROUP BY split(file.path, "/")[1] as Category
SORT sum(rows.outlinks) DESC
```

## üîÑ Most Connected Pages

```dataview
TABLE file.link as "Page", length(file.inlinks) as "Incoming", length(file.outlinks) as "Outgoing", (length(file.inlinks) + length(file.outlinks)) as "Total Connections"
FROM ""
WHERE (length(file.inlinks) + length(file.outlinks)) > 10
SORT (length(file.inlinks) + length(file.outlinks)) DESC
LIMIT 15
```

## üö® Critical Missing Links

These are frequently referenced but non-existent pages that should be created:

```dataview
LIST
FROM ""
WHERE any(file.outlinks, (x) => x.display = "Marina" OR x.display = "Deep Mother" OR x.display = "Seven Shards" OR x.display = "Convergence Point")
AND !x.file
LIMIT 10
```

## üìà Link Health Trends

### Files Created Without Links (Last 7 Days)
```dataview
TABLE file.link as "New File", file.ctime as "Created", length(file.outlinks) as "Outgoing", length(file.inlinks) as "Incoming"
FROM ""
WHERE file.ctime > date(today) - dur(7 days)
AND (length(file.outlinks) = 0 OR length(file.inlinks) = 0)
SORT file.ctime DESC
```
