**Sessions:** 4-6 sessions  
**Type:** Investigation/Exploration/Survival  

---

## Quest Summary

The renowned [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Academies/Windwright Academy]] sponsored expedition to the mysterious [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Shattered Isles]] has been missing for three months. Led by the famous explorer [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/People/Captain Zara Stormwind]], the expedition was tasked with investigating strange magical phenomena and mapping the treacherous floating island chains of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s outer reaches. Now, desperate families and the Academy itself seek brave adventurers to discover the fate of the lost expedition and recover their valuable research.

The truth is far more complex: the expedition discovered an ancient [[backups/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Skyforge Compass]] facility that's slowly corrupting the magical currents of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]], turning the very air toxic to life. Some expedition members have been transformed by the corrupted magic, while others desperately seek a way to contain the growing threat.

## Act I: The Trail Grows Cold

### Opening Hook

The quest begins when the party is approached by one of the following:

- **[[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Archmage Velina Duskweaver]]** of the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Academies/Windwright Academy]], offering 1,000gp to learn the expedition's fate
- **[[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Mira Stormwind]]**, Captain Zara's sister, begging for help finding her missing family member

### Initial Investigation (Sessions 1-2)

**Location:** [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Academies/Windwright Academy]], [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Nimbus]]

*"...found it...the source...corruption spreading...some of the crew are chang...don't trust...sky itself turns against..."*

**Clues Point To:** The [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Shattered Isles]], specifically a cluster called the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Crying Peaks]] where several [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Academies/Windwright Academy]] expeditions have vanished over the past decade.
