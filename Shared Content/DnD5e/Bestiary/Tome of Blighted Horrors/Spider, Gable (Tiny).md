# Spider, Gable (Tiny)
## Overview
### Spider, Gable (Tiny)
![[lpzzdota.oke.png|Spider, Gable (Tiny)|300]]
[[lpzzdota.oke.png|open outside]]

*A spider the size of an alley cat scampers up the side of a tenement building. In its mandibles, it drags what appears to be a clothesline, with many of the garments still dangling limply behind.*

**Initiative**: +3

**Armor Class**: 13

**Hit Points**: 2 (`dice: 1d4`)

**Speed**: 15 ft., climb 15 ft.

**Damage Immunities**: psychic damage

**Condition Immunities**: charm

**Senses**: Darkvision 30 ft., tremorsense in web

**Languages**: None

**Size**: Tiny

**Type**: Beast

## Special Traits
**Web Construct:** A creature that falls prone, is restrained, or is pushed into a gable spider web construct becomes restrained by the sticky material and can escape by using an action to make a successful DC 10 Str saving throw. A web construct is no more flammable than the material it’s made from, but each 5-foot-square section has AC 8 and 5 hit points. A gable spider can move across any web construct without hindrance.

## Actions
**Melee Attack—Bite:** +5 to hit (reach 0 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d4` poison damage, or half damage with a successful DC 10 Con saving throw.

**Ranged Attack—Sticky Globule (recharge 4-6):** +5 to hit (range 10 ft.; one creature). Hit: the creature must make a successful DC 10 Str saving throw or be restrained. A restrained creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself with a success.

## Description
**Environment**: Urban (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, or colony (3-10)

Gable spiders are different from other varieties of giant spiders, and it is for this reason that the whole of the city isn’t shrouded in endless sheets of webbing. Gable spiders are not web spinners. Although they don’t spin webs, gable spiders do have glands that produce a sticky fluid. This natural glue is used to string together the detritus they find in the city’s dumps and alleys—frayed ropes, sail cordage, clothesline, twisted rags, curtains, discarded cloth, and more—into weblike structures. Even lengths of chain and broken lumber can be found in the weblike contrivances the gable spiders build. They combine this myriad material in twisting, knotted mazes of suspended lines that rival the largest spider webs for complexity. They knot and anchor these mismatched lines among the rooftops, between sagging buildings, and with each other to create swaying but stable webs of junk. Anything foolish enough to enter one of their gluey web constructions is unlikely ever to leave.

The spiders also coat lengths of rope, cloth, sawdust, straw, or any other soft material with their fluid, wad it into a ball, and fling it at prey or at creautures they’re fighting. The sticky mass can glue a creature in place, making it easy prey for the gable spider’s poison.
