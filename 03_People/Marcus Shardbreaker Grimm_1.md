## Overview
A disgraced former Crystal Warden turned mercenary, Marcus gained his moniker after developing the ability to shatter crystal formationsâ€”including those growing from infected people. His methods are brutal but effective, making him simultaneously sought after and reviled.

## Abilities & Stats

**HP:** 76 (8d10 + 24)
**Speed:** 30 ft.

**STR:** 18 (+4) **DEX:** 13 (+1) **CON:** 16 (+3)

## Secrets
> [!warning] DM Only

> - The crystal in his eye is slowly spreading into his brain
> - Has discovered a way to temporarily reverse crystal corruption but requires fresh Shard fragments
> - Maintains a hidden safehouse with detailed maps of crystal growth patterns
> - Is being mentally influenced by the crystal in his eyeâ€”sometimes receives visions from the Amber Shard
> - Has made a pact: if he ever fully turns, he's arranged for specific people to kill him

## Plot Hooks
1. Hires party to help clear a crystal nest in exchange for corruption suppression techniques
2. Needs help tracking down a former Crystal Warden who's fully turned

## DM Notes
Marcus represents the personal cost of the crystal corruption and serves as a morally grey ally. He's useful for introducing party members to the darker aspects of the crystal plague while providing a potential tragic figure who might need savingâ€”or stoppingâ€”depending on how his corruption progresses. His connections span multiple factions, making him an excellent information broker and quest giver for mid-level threats.
