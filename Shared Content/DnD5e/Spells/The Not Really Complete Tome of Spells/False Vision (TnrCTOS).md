# False Vision (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *illusion*

**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when you learn you are targeted by any div-ination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.

**Range**: Self (30-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (the ground dust of an emerald worth at least 100 gp, which is con-sumed when the spell is cast)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


## Effects
Cast upon becoming aware that you or something else within 30 feet of you are being magically spied upon, you create an illusory image or thoughts that will be detected instead. At the same time, you and everything else of your choice that is within that radius become invisible to the scrying method.

This spell cannot be cast preemptively; it only functions after a divination spell has been cast on you.
