# 1359 - 1360 - Invasions of the Tuigan Horde
## Overview
**Time Span**: From: Monday, 1 January 1359 12:00:00 AM To: Tuesday, 1 January 1360 12:00:00 AM

Under the [[Command|command]] of the Horselord Yamun Khahan, the united Tuigan tribes of the Hordelands swiftly conquered Semphar and Khazari. Yamun’s vast horde invaded Shou Lung, but the Tuigan’s advance was turned back in Kara-Tur. The Tuigan army later moved west and attacked Thay and Rashemen before advancing along the primary trade route known as the Golden Way. Yamun’s horde invaded Thesk, but to meet the threat, many of the peoples of central Faerûn formed an alliance and assembled an army that included troops from Cormyr, the Dalelands, Hillsfar, [[Raven]]’s Bluff, the Earthfast Mountains, and other locations. Led by Azoun IV, the King of Cormyr, the allied forces defeated the Tuigan horde and killed Yamun near the Theskian city of Phsant.
