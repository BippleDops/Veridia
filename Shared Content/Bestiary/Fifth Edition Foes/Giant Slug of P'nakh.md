## Special Traits
**Smothering:** When a giant slug of P'nahk hits a creature with its crushing attack, it drops its body onto the creature, pinning it to the ground. Treat this as being grappled and restrained, but the creature must also make an immediate DC 14 Constitution saving throw. A successful saving throw indicates the creature inhaled a lungful of air before being trapped; a failed saving throw indicates the air was forced from the creature's lungs and it is suffocating. A suffocating creature can act normally for a number of rounds equal to its Con modifier (minimum of 1 round). Once those rounds expire, the creature drops to 0 hit points at the start of its next turn and it must make death saving throws.

**Insanity of P'nahk:** A giant P'Nahki slug can produce a momentary mental blast that transmits subliminal images of the nightmarish realm of P'nahk. All creatures in the affected area that fail a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw recall these images and must roll `dice: 1d4` to determine how they are affected (see below). In addition, affected characters repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns; the effect ends with a successful save (indicating the character managed to forget the images). Characters with Int scores of 16 or higher are peculiarly vulnerable to this attack; they make the saving throws with tactical disadvantage.


| **`dice: 1d4`** | **Effect** |
|---|---|
| 1 | Paralyzed; the character strikes back instinctively with a melee attack or a cantrip (as a reaction) against anything that attacks him or her, but can take no other action and can’t move. |
| 2 | Paranoid rage; the character attacks its nearest allies. |
| 3 | Self loathing; the character drops any held items and claws at his or her body, inflicting `dice: 1d4` slashing damage per round. |
| 4 | Awe of P’nahk; the character drops all held items, falls prone, and grovels in worship of the slug and all things P’nahki. The character is paralyzed. |

**Telepathy:** Giant slugs of P'nahk are telepathic, so they can communicate with all creatures within 100 feet.

**Transparency:** Because of its transparent body, a giant slug of P'nahk always has tactical advantage on Stealth checks and it can attempt to hide anytime it is lightly obscured, such as when it is in dim light.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A giant slug of P'nahk bites once and crushes once, or uses its mind blast.

**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (`dice: 2d10+4`) slashing damage.

**Crush:** *Melee Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (`dice: 2d10+4`) bludgeoning damage and the target is knocked prone, grappled, restrained, and smothered (see above).

**Mind Blast (Recharge 6):** Area Attack: automatic hit, range 60 ft. cone, creatures in cone. Hit: every creature in the affected area must make a successful DC 14 Intelligence saving throw or be affected by the insanity of P'nahk (see above). Characters with Int 16 or higher have tactical disadvantage on the saving throw.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any, but especially ancient ruins and underground

**Organization**: Solitary or pair

## Description
P’Nahki slugs are massive creatures with bodies so transparent that they are almost invisible. The only part of the slug’s anatomy that can be clearly seen is its disturbingly human-looking brain, which appears at first glance to be floating in the air. Their soft, thick hide gives them excellent protection against melee weapons.

These creatures originated in a forgotten place called P’Nahk; whether this was an alien city now in ruins, a lost world, or an entirely different dimension is not known. It’s entirely likely that even the slugs themselves don’t know the full answer to the mystery of their origin.

The giant slugs of P’Nahk are highly intelligent, although this intellect is seldom put to use in a way that can be related to human motivation or logic. They are most commonly encountered in remote subterranean realms or in the ruins of ancient civilizations, where they sift through the rubble in search of forgotten tomes and lost relics. They have been known to possess startling knowledge about the distant past and about magical artifacts, if one can persuade them to share.
