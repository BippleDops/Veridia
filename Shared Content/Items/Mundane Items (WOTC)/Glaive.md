# Glaive
**Type**: Mundane Item
**Group**: weapon, martial weapon, melee weapon
**Properties**: 1d10, slashing, - heavy, reach, two-handed
**Weight**: 6 lb.
**Value**: 20 gp
## Description: 
 Heavy. Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively. Reach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it. This property also determines your reach for opportunity attacks with a reach weapon. Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
