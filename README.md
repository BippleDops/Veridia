## Change the Theme
The vault comes with the ITS Theme because it's amazing and designed for TTRPGer's. A number of notes use functionality provided by this theme. You can change the theme if you like but you should install the [Callout Adjustments Snippet](https://publish.obsidian.md/slrvb-docs/ITS+Theme/Callout+Adjustments)

To change the style of the Theme. 
- Settings > Community Plugins > Style Settings > Options > ITS Theme Settings > Alternate Color Schemes > Pick one you like. 

## Templates

I use templates for more than just note templates. I create a lot of `note component` templates. By this I mean templates for things that go in a note. For example I don't know/remember how to make a [Callout Box](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts). Instead I press `Alt+T` and type `callout` and pick the one I like. 

There are two different ways to trigger a Template. 
- **Insert Default Template** - `Alt+T` - I primarily use these. 
- **Insert Templater Template** - `Alt+E` - This is used to trigger advanced templates. If you look in the left bar, there is a COG icon at the top with some buttons on that pane. Those buttons are used to Trigger Templater Templates. These are much more advanced and can move the note, rename the note, etc. These templates do not trigger correctly if you use the default template hotkey. 
  
> [!NOTE] Note
> You don't need templates for Callouts anymore. Simply right click in a note and select `ÃŒnsert > Callout`. From there you can right click the callout title to change the type of callout. 

## Default Editing Mode

The default editing mode can be changed. 

- **Live Preview Mode** - This is the default method and what the vault is configured to. Lots of the newer functionality requires Live Preview to work. As such I am using this as my default method these days. This mode lets you both see the rendered note and edit at the same time. 
	- Pros: This is the mode that Obsidian is developing for. New improved functionality like Tables and Properties work really well. 
	- Cons: Right aligned images and right aligned tables (wiki tables) do not work well or do not work at all. 
- **Source Mode** - This is the mode where you can click a button to switch between Edit Mode (see the text/syntax for a note) and Reading Mode (see the rendered note including images/tables). This is the method used in most of my videos. 
	- Pros: Easier to see what you are doing when editing syntax heavy notes. Things like right aligned images and right aligned tables (wiki tables) only work in Reading mode. 
	- Cons: Table/Properties do not work in this view. 

You can change this to meet your own requirements by: Settings > Editor > Default Editing Mode > [Make Choice]
