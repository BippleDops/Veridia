# Abyss Mirror Lake

The water ahead lies too still. In it, you see a sky that isn’t yours.

What you notice
- Ripples that move before you do
- A reflection that arrives late

What you can try
- Approach with care
- Keep voices low; listen

Possible outcomes
- A safe path reveals itself
- The mirror ripples wrong
- Something in the reflection looks back
