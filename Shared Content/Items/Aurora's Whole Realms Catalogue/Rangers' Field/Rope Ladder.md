## Description
Not a device typically needed by fleet-footed rangers, rope ladders become most useful when a ranger’s camp entertains nonadventurers. I know of one famous ranger who established a whole citadel in the wood, with houses in the trees and rope ladders to every door. Our rope ladders are also useful as bridges. We use only ¾ inch hemp with 2-inch board slats, for loads up to 800 pounds. Our rope ladders are sold in two-foot increments, minimum of 8 feet, maximum of 60 (1 sp/4 ft).
