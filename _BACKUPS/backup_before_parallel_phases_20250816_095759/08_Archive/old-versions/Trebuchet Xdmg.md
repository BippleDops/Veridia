%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 97* A Trebuchet is a catapult that throws its payload in a high arc so it can hit targets behind walls. Loading a Trebuchet requires two [[actions#Utilize|Utilize actions, and aiming it requires two more [actions#Utilize|Utilize]] actions. Then a crew member can take the Trebuchet Stone action.```ad-statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of trebuchet xdmg as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around trebuchet xdmg. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
