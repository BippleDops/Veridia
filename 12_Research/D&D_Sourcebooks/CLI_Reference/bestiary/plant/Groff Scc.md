# [[groff scc|Groff]]
*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 194*  

Many a Strixhaven student wandering the bayou has stepped on a seemingly mundane patch of mossâ€”only to discover that it was the back of a hungry groff lurking beneath the surface. These shaggy swamp creatures have canine faces and glowing blue eyes, and they are ravenous carnivoresâ€”with pest mascots being their favorite food. A handful of more intrepid Witherbloom mages have learned to follow groffs in order to track down pest mascots, but most of these mages have yet to find a way to capture the pests before the groff eats someone.
