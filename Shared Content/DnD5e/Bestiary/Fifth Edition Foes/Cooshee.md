## Special Traits
**Dominate:** A cooshee that has its opponent restrained and prone makes it very difficult for that foe to stand up again. To stand up, the creature must break the grapple, which also ends the restraint. If the creature fails in its attempt to break free, it takes 2 (`dice: 1d4`) piercing damage.

**Sprint:** Once per hour, a cooshee can move ten times its normal speed (400 ft.) for one round. When sprinting, it gains tactical advantage on Stealth checks.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A cooshee bites once and attacks once with claws.

**Bite:*** Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (`dice: 1d10+3`) piercing damage and the target is knocked prone and grappled and restrained (see Dominate above).

**Claw:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (`dice: 3d6+3`) slashing damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate forests

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, or pack (4–9)

## Description
Cooshees are large, 200-pound, 4-foot tall hounds. They are known throughout the world as elven dogs, for their features resemble those of elves and they are often found in the company of elves, who train them as guards. They bark only to warn their masters or other cooshees, but their bark can be heard clearly up to one mile away.

Cooshees attack by biting and tripping their foes. Once down, an opponent is held down. A cooshee trained as a guard can hold a person down until help comes; wild cooshees are more likely to tear the foe to pieces.

These dogs are also legendary for their ability to race like the wind in almost perfect silence. This is how cooshees launch most attacks; they begin their charge from so far away that they either haven’t been spotted yet or their intended victims believe they’re safe. If the cooshees weren’t spotted before they charged, odds are they’ll be among their foes and attacking without anyone hearing their approach.
