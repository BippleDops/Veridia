![](04_Resources/Assets/Locations/location-city-deepmind-conspiracy-deepmind-conspiracy.svg) # Deepmind Conspiracy *"In the depths of consciousness, where thoughts flow like currents, we have built the ultimate intelligence network - one that exists in minds rather than matter."* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview The Deepmind Conspiracy represents the most sophisticated intelligence operation in either Aethermoor or Aquabyssos - a psychic network that exists primarily in the collective consciousness of its members rather than in physical space. This mental infrastructure allows for instantaneous communication, shared knowledge, and coordinated operations across vast distances without leaving any physical evidence. Built around a core of powerful psychic individuals, the Conspiracy maintains a hidden web of informants, analysts, and operatives whose minds are linked through complex mental bonds. They gather intelligence not through conventional means, but by reading thoughts, accessing memories, and manipulating the mental states of targets. The organization serves as the primary intelligence resource for multiple shadow organizations while maintaining its own mysterious agenda. ### The Core Mind

*Unknown entity, neutral evil*
- Supreme controller of the psychic network
- May exist as collective consciousness rather than individual
- Unlimited telepathic range and memory manipulation abilities
- Never uses verbal communication, speaks directly into minds ### Mysteries

- Missing network members with no trace in physical or psychic space
- Unknown consciousness occasionally communicating through network
- Memory entities that seem to have independent existence
- Reality breaks experienced during deep psychic sessions --- *The Deepmind Conspiracy represents the ultimate violation of mental privacy - where individual consciousness becomes merely a resource in a vast intelligence operation, and the concept of private thought becomes meaningless.* ## Player-Facing Summary Deepmind Conspiracy is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Deepmind Conspiracy as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Deepmind Conspiracy. Therefore, ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Alliance - Manipulate succession ## Plot Hooks - An heirloom has gone missing and war looms

- A map reveals ancient history about a local noble
- Strange accidents suggest a curse
- A letter reveals a conspiracy about the government ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
