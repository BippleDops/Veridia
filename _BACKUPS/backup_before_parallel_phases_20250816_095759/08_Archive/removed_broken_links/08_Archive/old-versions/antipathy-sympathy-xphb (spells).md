--- # Antipathy/Sympathy

*8th-level, Enchantment* - **Casting time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a mix of vinegar and honey)
- **Duration:** 10 days As you cast the spell, choose whether it creates antipathy or sympathy, and target one creature or object that is Huge or smaller. Then specify a kind of creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. A creature of the chosen kind makes a Wisdom saving throw when it comes within 120 feet of the target. Your choice of antipathy or sympathy determines what happens to a creature when it fails that save: - **Antipathy.** The creature has the [[conditions#frightened|Frightened condition. The [conditions#frightened|Frightened]] creature must use its movement on its turns to get as far away as possible from the target, moving by the safest route. - **Sympathy.** The creature has the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed condition. The [conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] creature must use its movement on its turns to get as close as possible to the target, moving by the safest route. If the creature is within 5 feet of the target, the creature can't willingly move away. If the target damages the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed creature, that creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Ending the Effect If the [conditions#frightened|Frightened]] or [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed creature ends its turn more than 120 feet away from the target, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which it can be affected again. ## Summary **Classes**: [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 242. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* ## Player-Facing Summary Antipathy sympathy xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of antipathy sympathy xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around antipathy sympathy xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A prisoner has gone missing and chaos spreads
