Located in Crystalhaven's Embassy Quarter, her residence is a architectural marvel:
- Building partially flooded with breathable enchanted water
- Contains a portal pool to Aquabyssos (heavily guarded secret)
- Houses a growing collection of surface artifacts for study
- Basement connects to flooded tunnels beneath the city ## Plot Hooks

1. Hires party to retrieve a sunken relic from pre-drowning ruins
2. Requests escort to [Port Meridian|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]] for "trade negotiations"
3. Offers valuable information about underwater passages in exchange for crystal samples
4. Needs discrete investigation of ships that have been exploring too deep ## DM Notes

Nerida represents the looming threat of Aquabyssos while maintaining plausible deniability. She's a master manipulator who views the surface world as a chess board for the Tidal Courts' expansion. Her presence should make players question whether cooperation or conflict with the underwater realm is inevitable. ## Player-Facing Summary Ambassador Nerida Deepcurrent is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
