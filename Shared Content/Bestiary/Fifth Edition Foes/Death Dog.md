## Special Traits
Flawless Tracker: A death dog has tactical advantage on Wis (Perception) checks to follow a trail by scent.

Rotting Death: A creature bitten by a death dog must make a successful DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be infected with rotting death, which is both a curse and disease. An infected character repeats the saving throw at the end of every long rest. On a failed save, the character's maximum number of hit points immediately drops by 4 (`dice: 1d8`); on a successful save, it drops by 2 (`dice: 1d4`). Rotting death can be cured only by first removing the curse, then curing the disease; attempts to cure the disease while the curse is still in effect fail automatically.

## Actions
Multiattack: A death dog bites twice.

Bite: Melee Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d8+2`) piercing damage plus rotting death (see above).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Warm deserts

**Organization**: Hunt (2–4) or pack (5–10)

## Description
Death dogs resemble mastiffs, but with two heads. They are nocturnal killing machines that hunt their prey without hesitation across the desert sands and wastelands. Death dog packs have been known to share territory with other packs with little friction, although they do engage in dominance battles if food or water become scarce. Death dogs are strictly carnivores. They hunt and attack creatures much larger than themselves if they have the numbers to bring down a big opponent, but they are leery of hunting foes that outnumber the pack.
