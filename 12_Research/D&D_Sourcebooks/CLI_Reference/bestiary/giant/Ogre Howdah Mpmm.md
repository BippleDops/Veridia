The most unusual of the specialized ogres, the howdah carries a palisaded wooden fort on its back. The fort serves as a fighting platform for up to four Small people. Ogre howdahs are most often seen bearing bow- and spear-wielding [[goblin-warrior-xmm|goblins]] into battle, or perhaps [[kobold-warrior-xmm|kobolds]] or [[Bestiary]], but they might also transport other Small folk.

## Ogres of War

Ogres love to rush headlong into battle, but with enough time and patience, some of them learn to carry out specialized missions. The names they are givenâ€”the battering ram, the bolt launcher, the chain brute, and the howdahâ€”reflect their particular functions. These jobs are tailored to take advantage of an ogre's strengths.
