*8th-level, Abjuration* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 24 hours Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch has [[immunity-xphb (variant-rules) to Psychic damage and the [conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] condition. The target is also unaffected by anything that would sense its emotions or alignment, read its thoughts, or magically detect its location, and no spellâ€”not even [[wish-xphb (spells)â€”can gather information about the target, observe it remotely, or control its mind. **Classes**: [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 298.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of mind blank xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around mind blank xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - The authorities needs help investigating before the festival
