*Potion, very rare* - **Weight**: 0.5 lbs. When you drink this potion, it removes any [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] levels you have and ends the [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition on you. For the next 24 hours, you regain the maximum number of [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] for any [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] Die you spend. This potion's crimson liquid regularly pulses with dull light, calling to mind a heartbeat. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 289.
