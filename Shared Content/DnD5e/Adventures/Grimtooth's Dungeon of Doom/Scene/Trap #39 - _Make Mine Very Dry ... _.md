# Trap #39 - "Make Mine Very Dry ... "
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The door opens onto a 30 foot corridor ending in another bronze door. This is identical to the one the party just passed through, down to the wheel in the center. After the party has insulated themselves they will more than likely start turning. Nothing obvious will happen. What this wheel does is release the large block of stone at the end of the corridor the party has just come from.
> 
> If the party was put off by the first bronze door they will have proceeded to the end of the first corridor and encountered the blank stone wall. When this door wheel is turned it will activate a mechanism that causes the corridor to open by lowering the stone into the floor of the corridor. The reason for this will become apparent. This is the initial set up for one of the best "one-two punch:.' traps I have ever seen. (And believe me I've seen 'em all!)
> 
> Eventually the door, or in the case of those entering from [[Trap #25 - _How Long Can You Tread Water__|Trap #25]], the trap door, will open to reveal a very large room 30 feet deep, and opening 50 feet off to the right and 50 feet off to the left. The ceiling is over 12 feet high. To the left as the tomb robbers enter are shelves of scrolls and bound notes. Off to the right are numerous chests, and containers, as well as bolts of what looks like cloth. Directly in front of the party is a vast oaken desk behind which is a throne like wooden chair. Members of the party with any mercantile skills at all will be able to tell the others that the desk and chair would have great value (2,500 g.p.) even if the other stuff is junk.
> 
> Magic-using members of the party will at this point want to extend a cautionary note. The room is permeated by a magical spell. Upon investigation the wizardly members of the group will know it is a spell of preservation, which will make sense because of the paper, and cloth contents of the room. The spell will not trigger any overt offensive actions. It serves only to protect the contents of the room from the ravages of being stored for a long, long time, in a potentially damp environment.
> 
> The party will want to enter the room to inspect the contents, but in light of past events they will be very cautious. Eventually one or all of them will go in. Now the fun begins! The members of the party will find that there are chests containing very valuable silks, and linens. They will also find, in the chests farthest from the door, cloth-of-gold. This is a type of fabric woven of fine metal filaments, so that it feels like fabric, but is in fact pure gold . There is also copper and silver fabric as well, each so unique that its like is not found in the world today, save in the courts of kings and emperors. There is one chest each of each metal fabric, and the value is over 10,000 g.p. each. The nine other chests of other fabrics are worth 1,000 g.p. each! The party should be overjoyed. Of course this inventory should take some time, oh trap master, and you should keep track of this passage of time. It is under one of these chests of exotic fabric that the Trap Door up from [[Trap #25 - _How Long Can You Tread Water__|Trap #25]] is located.
> 
> The scroll side of the room is a veritable treasure trove as well. Each parchment is an historical document, and could be sold to antiquarians and wizards fora princely sums. The piece-de-resistance is the short shelf on the wall farthest from [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]]. On this shelf is a collection of spell scrolls, many of which have gone out of the world! This information is priceless, or would be if any member of the party knew the languages they were written in. Delvers should not be daunted. They will discern, if there is still a living magic user among them, what the scrolls are. Someone can be found who will be able to translate them. The value of the entire collection is over 50,000 g.p.! As with the silks, an inventory will take time.
> 
> The reason for keeping track of the time spent in this room is that the spell laid on the room is a Spell of Desiccation. It excludes moisture in ALL forms. If the party spends only one tum in the room, they will be thirsty, but not be extra ordinarily so. Two turns, brings a noticeable thirst with some urgency. Three turns, brings an obsessive desire for a drink. Four turns, or longer and the party members who have entered the room will kill for a drink of any substance that even gives the impression of moisture!
> 
> A full canteen will slake the thirst of one person, the catch being that any canteen that has been in the room will be "Bone Dry". The thirst effect will only begin to be felt after it reaches the Third turn level, then only as an urgent thirst. The party will likely flee unless the brightest members have already become trap tofu. If they leave the room before the Fourth turn effect sets in, keep in mind the effect is cumulative. If they go back in they will just get dryer, and dryer. Looting this room is thirsty work, VERY THIRSTY WORK!
> 
> The room is only a one skuller, but don't let that dismay you, the best is yet to come! If the party entered this trap from the Trap Door in the floor under the chests of clol.h, reverse the operation of [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] door, [[Trap #38 - _ ...I t Makes Me Feel Tingly All Over!_|Trap #38]]. We wouldn't want the party to miss out on any of the fun, would we? And keep in mind the level of thirst keeps increasing. This could force trips up and down the ladder for water while the party waits for the door to open. Remember the canteens will be dry before they can cross the room from the Trap Door to the regular entrance.
