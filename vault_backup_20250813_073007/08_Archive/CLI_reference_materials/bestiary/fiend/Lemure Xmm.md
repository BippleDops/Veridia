*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 194. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)*  

Lemures torment weaker creatures, but in the Nine Hells, few such beings exist. To avoid greater suffering, they obey the orders of more powerful devils.

## Lemures

*Devils of Agony and Despair*

- **Habitat.** Planar (Nine Hells)  
- **Treasure.** None  

The least of all devils, lemures arise from wicked souls, their mortal memories scoured away. Only vague limbs and anguished features jut from these slurries of infernal proto-matter.
