# Spell Lists
*Comprehensive Catalog of Cross-Realm Magic*

> *"In the depths where pressure shapes possibility and on the surface where winds carry wonder, magic takes countless forms. These spells represent the accumulated knowledge of both worlds - techniques honed in crushing darkness and perfected in brilliant light, each adapted to serve those who would master the impossible."*
> â€” [[Archmage Tidal Currentweave]], Master of Both Traditions at the [[Institute of Unified Magic]]

## Overview

The magical traditions of [[Aquabyssos]] and [[Aethermoor]] have developed independently over millennia, creating distinct approaches to spellcasting that reflect their radically different environments and challenges. Underwater magic emphasizes adaptation, pressure manipulation, and biological integration, while surface magic focuses on elemental control, atmospheric manipulation, and terrestrial phenomena.

The recent cooperation between realms has revealed that many spells can be adapted for cross-realm use, while others require fundamental modification to function in foreign environments. This comprehensive catalog organizes spells by their adaptability and provides both traditional and modified versions for practitioners operating in unfamiliar settings.

Spells are categorized by their origin realm, level of power, and environmental requirements, enabling spellcasters to select appropriate techniques for their current situation while understanding the modifications necessary for effective cross-realm casting.

### Aquabyssos Magic Principles
**Pressure Integration**: Underwater magic harnesses water pressure as both a power source and focusing medium, creating spells that grow stronger with depth while maintaining effectiveness through pressure differentials.

**Biological Harmony**: Aquatic spells work with rather than against living systems, using biological processes as components and creating effects that integrate seamlessly with underwater ecosystems.

**Current Channeling**: Ocean currents serve as both power conduits and spell delivery systems, enabling effects to be transmitted across vast distances while drawing energy from natural water movement.

**Depth Resoce**: Deep-sea magic utilizes the unique acoustic properties of water to create spells that can affect targets at extreme ranges while remaining undetectable to surface dwellers.

### Aethermoor Magic Principles
**Atmospheric Manipulation**: Surface magic harnesses air pressure, wind patterns, and weather systems as power sources while creating effects that work with rather than against atmospheric conditions.

**Solar Integration**: Many surface spells draw energy from sunlight while storing power for use during dark periods, creating sustainable casting systems that complement natural cycles.

**Terrestrial Resoce**: Earth-based magic utilizes geological formations and mineral deposits as focusing elements while drawing power from planetary magnetic and gravitational fields.

**Elemental Balance**: Surface casting emphasizes the interaction between different elemental forces, creating complex effects through the controlled combination of opposing energies.

### Cross-Realm Adaptations
**Environmental Bridging**: Modified spells that function effectively in both aquatic and aerial environments by utilizing universal principles rather than environment-specific phenomena.

**Power Source Substitution**: Techniques for replacing environment-specific power sources with universal alternatives, enabling familiar spells to function in unfamiliar settings.

**Effect Translation**: Methods for achieving equivalent results through different mechanisms, allowing spellcasters to maintain their capabilities despite environmental limitations.

### Universal Defensive Magic
Protective spells that function effectively in both environments with minor modifications.

### Universal Utility Magic
Practical spells that provide useful effects in both environments.

### Environmental Synthesis Spells

### Biomancer Spells
Specialized magic focused on biological manipulation and creature enhancement.

### Depth Specialist Spells
Magic developed by practitioners who spend extended time in deep ocean environments.

### Crystal Specialist Spells
Magic that manipulates crystalline structures and resot frequencies.

### Restricted Spell Classifications
Magic that is forbidden due to dangerous consequences or corrupted nature.

## Player-Facing Summary

Spell Lists is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Spell Lists as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Spell Lists.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
