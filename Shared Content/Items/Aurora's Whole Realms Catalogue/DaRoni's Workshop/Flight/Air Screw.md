## Description
I come up with this idea when I was watching a big whirling storms at sea. A water spout grew up from the sea and started to suck the water out into the ether. I thought maybe if I make a spout like that, I could also go to the ether.

So I made the air screw (75 gp) I show here. By turning the crank with your feet, the screw starts spinning in circles above the device and makes a great wind. Will then lift straight off the earth into the sky. Cant get to the ether, though.

## Additional Details
to calculate probability of failure per round, subtract str and Dex from PCs weight \[e.g. 120 lb - (Str 14 + Con 16) = 90% chance failure per round]; if successful, can rise 10 feet/round; regular falling damage applies for failure; magic that alters weight, Str, or Con affects [[Flight|flight]] through formula
