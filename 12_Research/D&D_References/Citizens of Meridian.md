The Citizens of Meridian represent a unique demographic within Aethermoor society, comprising individuals who live and work in the transitional zones between the surface territories and the deeper regions that interface with Aquabyssos. These citizens have developed distinctive cultural practices, technological adaptations, and social structures that reflect their position as intermediaries between two vastly different worlds. Their daily lives involve constant adaptation to pressure changes, environmental shifts, and the complex diplomatic requirements of inter-realm relations. Meridian citizens have evolved specialized skills in pressure adaptation, environmental engineering, and cross-cultural communication that make them invaluable to both Aethermoor and Aquabyssos societies. They serve as translators, negotiators, technical specialists, and cultural ambassadors, bridging the gap between surface and underwater civilizations. Their communities represent some of the most technologically advanced and culturally diverse settlements in either realm. ### Origins

The first Citizens of Meridian emerged during the early contact period between Aethermoor and Aquabyssos, when pioneering individuals from both societies established settlement outposts in the boundary regions to facilitate trade and communication. These early settlers faced unprecedented challenges in creating livable environments that could accommodate both surface and underwater physiology while managing the complex environmental transitions between realms. Initial communities were primarily composed of volunteers and exiles who were willing to accept the risks and uncertainties of boundary living in exchange for the opportunities it provided. These pioneers developed the fundamental technologies and cultural practices that would define Meridian society. ### Development

As inter-realm relations stabilized and expanded, Meridian communities grew into sophisticated settlements with specialized infrastructure designed for dual-environment functionality. The development of pressure-adaptive architecture, hybrid transportation systems, and multi-species accommodation facilities attracted settlers with technical skills and diplomatic aptitudes. During the Great Convergence period, Meridian citizens played crucial roles in facilitating the political and cultural negotiations that established formal relations between the realms. Their unique position and specialized knowledge made them indispensable mediators in complex inter-realm disputes and agreements. ### Current Era

Modern Citizens of Meridian represent a fully developed sub-culture within Aethermoor society, with their own political representation, economic systems, and cultural institutions. They maintain dual citizenship status that allows them to participate in both realm's societies while maintaining their distinct identity as boundary dwellers. Current Meridian communities serve as testbeds for experimental technologies and cultural innovations that may eventually be adopted by both surface and underwater societies. Their expertise in adaptation and integration makes them leaders in addressing contemporary challenges like crystal corruption and environmental instability. ### In Aquabyssos

Aquabyssos views Meridian citizens as essential partners in maintaining peaceful and productive relations with the surface world. Their ability to understand underwater culture while communicating effectively with surface dwellers makes them trusted intermediaries for sensitive negotiations and cultural exchanges. Many Aquabyssos officials consider Meridian communities to be successful examples of what inter-realm cooperation can achieve, though some conservative factions worry about the dilution of traditional underwater culture through excessive surface influence. ### In Aethermoor

Aethermoor society recognizes Meridian citizens as pioneers and innovators whose adaptability and specialized knowledge contribute significantly to the realm's technological and diplomatic advancement. However, some surface communities view them with suspicion, questioning their loyalty and cultural authenticity due to their extensive underwater connections. The success of Meridian communities has inspired similar experimental settlements and cultural exchange programs throughout Aethermoor, though none have achieved the same level of integration and effectiveness. ### The Great Mediation

Meridian citizens successfully negotiated a peaceful resolution to a major territorial dispute between Aethermoor and Aquabyssos forces, establishing their reputation as skilled diplomats. ### The Pressure Crisis

When environmental instability threatened multiple boundary settlements, Meridian citizens developed emergency adaptation protocols that saved thousands of lives and preserved inter-realm infrastructure. ### The Cultural Exchange Initiative

The first large-scale student and professional exchange program between realms was organized and administered entirely by Meridian citizens, creating lasting cross-cultural relationships. ## Current Developments

Recent challenges from crystal corruption have required Meridian citizens to develop new adaptation techniques and protective protocols. Their unique position makes them crucial in understanding how corruption affects the boundary zones and developing countermeasures that work in multiple environments. The growing complexity of inter-realm relations has led to increased demand for Meridian citizen services, prompting expansion of training programs and settlement infrastructure to accommodate growing populations. ## Adventure Hooks
