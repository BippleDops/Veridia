# Trap #54 - "If You Think You've Got It Made You're All Wet!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> At this point the party may now enter the room. It is huge: 130 feet long, and 30 feet wide. The ceiling is 20 feet overhead and covered with more gold leaf, from end to end. The gold leaf on the ceiling is worked into fantastic patterns of soaring elemental forms flying and leaping about, cavorting with an inhuman joy. Covering the floor at the party's feet are 10 foot by 10 foot tiles of rust colored porcelain, worked throughout with gold wire. These tiles depict a different type of elementals surging and Î¼irusting in a dance of brutish abandon. The walls are covered with a bright crimson damask worked with golden threads.

> The walls are covered with a bright crimson damask worked with golden threads. The elementals here are picked out in a rushing, flashing, flickering dance of glee, and destruction. A truely wonderous sight. 
> 
> (Sorry to interrupt this epic scene, but loot is loot. The tiles, if pried up, are worth 1,000 g.p. each. If the delvers try to break it up and get at the gold wire they are idiots and the tiles will be worthless. The damask on the walls will come free if pulled carefully. It is remarkably well preserved, and worth 50 g.p. a square yard. Again if they try to pluck out the gold thread they are boobs of the first water and all will be worthless. Lastly the gold leaf on the ceiling is worth about 3,500 g.p. but will take a great deal of time to remove. Delvers will ask if they live up to the true vandalistic nature that makes them so much fun to provoke into acts of self destruction.) 
> 
> At the far end of the room is a raised dais, upon which is an ebon sarcophagus. Behind it there is a golden statue which illuminates the room with a magical glow. It is a statue of a short stumpy man robed as a great wizard. It is cloaked in the signed robe, with the conical peaked hat. In one hand is a staff of a unique and twisted design. In the statue's other hand is a golden orb from which comes the light that illuminates the room. The visage is familiar to the entire party. This is a golden statue of Evinrood the Water Wizard, Master of the Elementals. (Fanfare! Bells, whistles, let fly the confetti.) The party is in the presence of more wealth in one place than at any other point in the dungeon. This golden statue is worth well over 150,000 g.p. Have fun carrying it out! 
> 
> Tomb robbers being tomb robbers, greed will more than likely compel them to open the sarcophagus. If, however, they have a sudden burst of good sense and try to take the statue (which weighs about 5 tons.) the same events will transpire. 
> 
> If the lid of the sarcophagus is opened, or the statue moved, or broken (which will cause it to move) the trap will be sprung. 
> 
> The only element not represented by the art in this room is water. Ever the completist, Evinrood's devices hasten to oblige. The entire room is a gigantic iron box, which when released swings down at the end with the statue, the sarcophagus, and presumably the entire party in it. The pivot point is a giant shaft under the floor just beyond the door. The room will rush through an arc and crash with lethal suddenness into the wall below. In this position the last 25 feet of the room will swing through the bottom of the lake. At this time the far wall, which is now the ceiling will collapse under the weight of the lake and the room will fill with water, the final element. 
> 
> The impact of the room hitting the wall at the end of its swing, the multi-ton statue flying around, not to mention the stone dais, and the sarcophagus, the ceiling falling 130 feet in a rain of stony debris, and finally being at the bottom of a 130 foot waterfall, should result in a satisfying climax. I for one have seldom seen more ways to be done in at one time in one trap. This is a four skull trap if there ever was one. It even provides a hint for the faint hearted trap master to use to say "I warned you!" (If by some happenstance a demi-god has wandered in with the party add a final insult and dump the Glass Catfish in on top of him. If all this fails maybe he will climb out on the Island and the Green Blob will get him.)
> 
> At this point it will seem the best is over. The delvers have ransaked, or been ransacked by, the tomb and there seems to be nothing else to assault. Well have no fear, Evinrood has not been found as the delvers peered into the black sarcophagus they saw it was empty. The stumpy little rat is in here somewhere. There must be someplace that was missed.
> 
> Clues to his whereabouts can be found on the "treasure map" from the "X" room. The map at the time showed undifferentiated information, but a flash of insight will cause the tomb robbers to look at it again. If they have exhausted all the other possibilities in the dungeon, then the map will reveal itself as a layout of the dungeon. If there are other places the party has not checked the map will seem blank.
> 
> If the map is revealed the party will notice an area in the very center of the dungeon where there are rooms they have not explored.
> 
> A clue can also be supplied to the party even if they lost the map to the quicksand. A member of the group could, upon racking his brain, (Yes contrary to popular belief delvers do have brains.) recognize that at the point after the crystal warrior/delverpolishingroom there was an architectural anomaly. The corridor leading to the blank wall that forces the delvers to turn to the doors that lead to [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] of [[4 - The Path Less Traveled|THE PATH LESS TRAVELED]] is 20 feet wide but the doors themselves are only 10 feet wide. Clearly there should be a 20 foot wide corridor leading from this point as well!
