![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/scarab-of-protection.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This beetle-shaped medallion provides three benefits while it is on your person.

## Defense

You gain a +1 bonus to [[armor-class-xphb|Armor Class]].

## Preservation

The scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a Necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an Undead, you can take a [[reaction-xphb|Reaction]] to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.

## Spell Resistance

You have [[advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on saving throws against spells.
