## Overview
Known only as "Mist," this enigmatic figure operates in the liminal spaces between light and shadow throughout [[Aquabyssos. More shadow than flesh after years of bonding with umbral entities, she trades in the most dangerous commodity of all: secrets. Unlike [Jasper "Three-Eyes" Flint]]'s crude information brokerage, Mist deals in secrets that can topple governments, destroy lives, or grant impossible power. Her true identity, origins, and even physical form remain mysteries that have confounded investigators for years.

## Secrets
> [!warning] DM Only
> - Was once a surface world noble named Lady Evangeline Blackmere
> - Bonded with shadows to survive assassination attempt, lost most humanity
> - Knows the true identity of several major NPCs in both realms
> - Has stolen memories from the [[Deep Mother's dreams
> - Maintains a secret alliance with surface world shadow organizations
> - Her shadow nature is slowly consuming her - she's running out of time
> - The violet eyes are actually trapped souls of her first victims
