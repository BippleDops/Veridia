# Summon Undead
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/summon-undead.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gilded skull worth 300+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth an Undead spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/undead-spirit-xphb|Undead Spirit]] stat block. When you cast the spell, choose the creature's form: Ghostly, Putrid, or Skeletal. The spirit resembles an Undead creature with the chosen form, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/initiative-xphb|Initiative]] count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Dodge|Dodge]] action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.
