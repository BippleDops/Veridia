## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour


## Effects
You summon a minor spirit that takes the form of either a ghostly or elemental animal. Choose one of the following options for what appears:

♦ One beast of challenge rating 4 or lower

♦ Two beasts of challenge rating 3 or lower

♦ Four beasts of challenge rating 2 or lower

Depending on what sort of spirit you summon, it has one of the following templates:

♦ ***Flame-Beast.*** The flame-beast is re-sistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slash-ing damage from nonmagical weapons, and is immune to fire damage, and being grap-pled, paralyzed, restrained, or unconscious. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. Its attacks do fire damage. Any creature that touches the flame-beast or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 1d10 fire dam-age. It takes 1d6 damage if splashed by at least one gallon of water.

♦ ***Ghost-Beast.*** The ghost-beast has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons, and is immune to necrotic and poison damage and to being charmed, frightened, grappled, paralyzed, poisoned, restrained, or uncon-scious. It has truesight to 100 feet. It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 1d10 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. The creature’s attacks do necrotic dam-age. ♦ ***Stone-Beast.*** The stone-beast can bur-row at a speed of 30 feet, is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons, and is immune to poison damage, bludgeoning damage from magical weapons, and to being petrified, poisoned, or unconscious. Its AC becomes 16 (natural armor).

♦ ***Wave-Beast.*** The wave-beast can swim at a speed of 60 feet, is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons, and is immune to acid damage and bludgeoning damage from magical weapons, and to being poisoned, grappled, paralyzed, restrained, or uncon-scious. It can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there, and can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing. If it is struck my cold damage, its movement is reduced to 20 feet.

♦ ***Wind-Beast.*** The air-beast can fly at a speed of 60 feet, is resistant to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons, and is immune to cold and lightning damage, and to being poisoned, grappled, paralyzed, restrained, or unconscious. It can enter a hostile creature’s space and stop there, and can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing.

Each beast is considered to be undead (ghost-beast) or elemental (the others), and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The summoned crea-tures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.

The DM has the creatures’ statistics.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a higher-level spell slot, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 8th-level slot or three times as many with a 9th-level spell slot.
