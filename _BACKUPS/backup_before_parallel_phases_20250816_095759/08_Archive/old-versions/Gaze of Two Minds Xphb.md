--- # Gaze of Two Minds

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 156. Available in the SRD* **Prerequisite**: Level 5 Warlock You can use a [[Action Xphb to touch a willing creature and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can take a [Action Xphb]] on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. The connection ends if you don't maintain it in this way. While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you can cast spells as if you were in your space or the other creature's space if the two of you are within 60 feet of each other. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Gaze of two minds xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
