# Dislocating Larvae
## Overview
```ad-warning
title: GM Directions
collapse: open
These tiny green larvae resemble tadpoles no larger than a pinhead, but they can spawn in sufficient numbers in small pools of stagnant water to give it a greenish tint. A full-grown dislocating larva resembles a green hair 2 or 3 inches long.

When ingested, the larvae colonize the stomach of the victim, where they begin reproducing within `dice: 1d6` hours in the digestive tract. As they reach maturity, they feed on the surrounding tissue and migrate on to nearby organs as they lay thousands of eggs. These hatch into even more larvae, which continue the colonization. The pain causes terrible convulsions in the victim that can be forceful enough to dislocate joints.

The victim of a dislocating larvae infestation loses `dice: 1d4` points from Constitution every day. When the victim’s Constitution has dropped to half or less of its starting value, the victim is stunned by pain, unable to do anything but writhe spasmodically. When the victim’s Constitution drops to 4 or lower, the victim is incapacitated instead of stunned, and it feels an overpowering need to seek out a body of stagnant water and drown in it (so the larvae colony in the body can survive instead of dying with the host).

Any magic that cures diseases, kills all the larvae and eggs in the victim. Lost Constitution points don’t recover normally but can be restored with magic.
