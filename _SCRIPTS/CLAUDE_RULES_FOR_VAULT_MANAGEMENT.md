# CRITICAL RULES FOR CLAUDE - VAULT MANAGEMENT

## ‚ö†Ô∏è NEVER DO THESE THINGS

### 1. **NEVER REORGANIZE WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION**
- ‚ùå NEVER rename folders
- ‚ùå NEVER move entire directory structures
- ‚ùå NEVER change the established folder hierarchy
- ‚ùå NEVER assume "reorganize" means "restructure"
- ‚úÖ ONLY organize files WITHIN existing folders when asked

### 2. **NEVER DELETE CAMPAIGN/SESSION CONTENT**
- ‚ùå NEVER move sessions out of 06_Sessions
- ‚ùå NEVER move campaigns out of 01_Adventures/Campaigns
- ‚ùå NEVER treat user content as "duplicates"
- ‚ùå NEVER delete encounters, hooks, or adventure content
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS preserve user-created game content

### 3. **NEVER CREATE DUPLICATE DIRECTORIES**
- ‚ùå NEVER create 00_COMMAND_CENTER when 00_System exists
- ‚ùå NEVER create new root directories without asking
- ‚ùå NEVER duplicate existing folder structures
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS work with existing directories

### 4. **NEVER CREATE FILES FROM BROKEN LINKS**
- ‚ùå NEVER create .md files for broken [[links]]
- ‚ùå NEVER create files like "step_001 (phase_092).md"
- ‚ùå NEVER create files with path patterns in names
- ‚ùå NEVER create .png.md or .svg.md files
- ‚úÖ ONLY fix links by finding the correct target

### 5. **NEVER TRUST FILE NAMES ALONE**
- ‚ùå NEVER assume a file's category from its name
- ‚ùå NEVER move files based solely on filename patterns
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS check file content before categorizing
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS verify a file's purpose before moving

## ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO THESE THINGS

### 1. **ALWAYS ASK BEFORE MAJOR CHANGES**
- ‚úÖ Ask before moving more than 10 files
- ‚úÖ Ask before creating new directories
- ‚úÖ Ask before deleting any user content
- ‚úÖ Ask before restructuring anything

### 2. **ALWAYS CREATE BACKUPS**
- ‚úÖ Move files to 08_Archive instead of deleting
- ‚úÖ Create recovery scripts for risky operations
- ‚úÖ Document what was moved/changed
- ‚úÖ Provide clear recovery paths

### 3. **ALWAYS PRESERVE STRUCTURE**
- ‚úÖ Keep the numbered folder system (00-09)
- ‚úÖ Maintain established hierarchies
- ‚úÖ Respect special folders (_SCRIPTS, _INDEXES)
- ‚úÖ Understand 08=Archive, 09=Performance (not content)

### 4. **ALWAYS VALIDATE OPERATIONS**
- ‚úÖ Test scripts on small samples first
- ‚úÖ Check results after each operation
- ‚úÖ Verify files ended up where intended
- ‚úÖ Count files before and after operations

### 5. **ALWAYS UNDERSTAND CONTEXT**
- ‚úÖ Read file content, not just names
- ‚úÖ Understand user's actual request
- ‚úÖ Consider campaign/game context
- ‚úÖ Respect the TTRPG vault purpose

## üéØ SPECIFIC PATTERNS TO AVOID

### Files That Should NEVER Exist:
1. `*_03_Mechanics_CLI_bestiary_*.md` (outside proper locations)
2. `step_XXX (phase_YYY).md`
3. `*.png.md`, `*.svg.md`, `*.json.md`
4. Files with `(D&D_References)` or `(category)` in names
5. Files starting with `#`, `$`, `%`, `<`
6. Multiple versions: `_1.md`, `_2.md`, `_Quick_Ref.md`
7. Path patterns: `04_Resources_Assets_*` in filenames

### Operations That Need Confirmation:
1. Moving any session files
2. Moving any campaign files
3. Deleting more than 10 files
4. Creating new root directories
5. Renaming existing directories
6. Bulk file movements (>100 files)

## üìã CHECKLIST BEFORE RUNNING SCRIPTS

- [ ] Did I understand what the user ACTUALLY wants?
- [ ] Will this preserve their campaign/session content?
- [ ] Will this maintain the existing structure?
- [ ] Have I created a backup/recovery method?
- [ ] Have I tested on a small sample first?
- [ ] Will this create any duplicate directories?
- [ ] Will this generate files from broken links?
- [ ] Did I check file contents, not just names?

## üö® EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### If Something Goes Wrong:
1. STOP immediately
2. Document what happened
3. Create recovery script
4. Check 08_Archive for moved files
5. Restore from backup if available
6. Apologize and explain clearly

### Recovery Locations:
- `08_Archive/duplicates/` - Files marked as duplicates
- `08_Archive/removed_broken_links/` - Removed broken files
- `09_Performance/reports/` - Operation reports
- `_SCRIPTS/EMERGENCY_RECOVERY.py` - Recovery script

## üìù LESSONS FROM THIS SESSION

1. **"Reorganize" ‚â† "Restructure"** - User wanted files organized WITHIN folders, not folders renamed
2. **Campaigns are Sacred** - Never move campaign/session content without explicit permission
3. **Duplicates Need Verification** - Not all similar files are duplicates
4. **Broken Links Don't Need Files** - Don't create .md files for every [[broken link]]
5. **Test First, Execute Second** - Always test operations on small samples
6. **Archive, Don't Delete** - Move questionable files to archive for recovery

## üé≤ REMEMBER: THIS IS A TTRPG VAULT

The purpose is to support tabletop roleplaying games. Every decision should:
- Enhance the gaming experience
- Preserve campaign continuity
- Protect user-created content
- Maintain quick access during sessions
- Support both planning and play
