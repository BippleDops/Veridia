# Reality Merge Zones

*Where Two Worlds Become One, and Survival Demands Adaptation*

> *"In the Merge Zones, the very air might drown you and the water may refuse to wet your skin. Physics becomes negotiable, magic becomes unpredictable, and survival depends not just on what you know, but on how quickly you can adapt to rules that change with every step."*
> — [[Master Environmental Specialist Tidal Convergence]], Reality Merge Zone Survival Expert
