# Water Whip
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 81*  

You can spend 2 ki points as an action to create a whip of water that shoves and pulls a creature to unbalance it. A creature that you can see that is within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes `3d10` bludgeoning damage, plus an extra `d10` bludgeoning damage for each additional ki point you spend, and you can either knock it [[conditions#Prone|prone]] or pull it up to 25 feet closer to you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don't pull it or knock it [[conditions#Prone|prone]].

## Player-Facing Summary

Water whip is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of water whip as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around water whip.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties water whip to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at water whip to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to water whip active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
