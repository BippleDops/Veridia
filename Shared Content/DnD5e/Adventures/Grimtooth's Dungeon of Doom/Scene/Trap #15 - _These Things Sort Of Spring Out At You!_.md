# Trap #15 - "These Things Sort Of Spring Out At You!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> On the left side of [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] chamber is another door. This door is 10 feet tall, and consists of two panels, each 5 feet wide. There are three finger holes on the left hand door, and the doors seem to be locked. This three hole locking mechanism works exactly like all the other three hole locks, or as with the others it can be opened with the appropriate low level door opening spell.
> 
> It is only after the doors are unlocked that the real fun begins. These babies are hinged in the middle, so that the doors are released from the opposite ends. This brings them together in the middle, flush, with no knobs or opening rings to keep them apart. This makes the greatest crepe press you've ever seen. In order to create this delver-matic patty-maker there are six large springs of various lengths mounted at different heights against the stairs behind the doors. When the locks are released the doors clap together, splat! The effect is deliciously gooey, and should be effective 50% (LS) of the time on the delver who opens the doors and has to use the finger holes. If the doors are opened by a magic user, the saving throw can be mitigated by the distance from the doors, up to a clean miss (drat!) at over 5 feet away. Don't let a miss disturb you because there are still the six springs. Once they have slammed the doors together the springs are released to fly wildly about the room with vicious ( though not lethal, alas!) force causing contusions to all and sundry. There is an 80% chance (L2) to avoid being hit, and damage will be inversely proportionate to the amount of armour or padding the victim is wearing, grading up from bumps and bruises to possible broken bones in the case of the weak, or unprotected.
> 
> The springs are worth 100 g.p. each due to the difficulty of obtaining this type of dwarvish craftsmanship.
> 
> The door is a three skull trap, tough but evadeable. The springs are only one skull but they do provide entertainment value.
