*Ring, legendary (requires attunement)* The Ring of Elemental Command (earth) is linked to the Elemental Plane of Earth. Every Ring of Elemental Command has the following two properties: - **Elemental Bane.** While wearing the ring, you have [[Advantage Xphb on attack rolls against Elementals and they have [Advantage Xphb]] on attack rolls against you. - **Elemental Compulsion.** While wearing the ring, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic action to try to compel an Elemental you see within 60 feet of yourself. The Elemental makes a **DC 18** Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the Elemental has the [conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] condition until the start your next turn, and you determine what it does with its move and action on its next turn. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Elemental Focus While wearing the ring, you benefit from additional properties corresponding to the ring's linked Elemental Plane: - **Earth.** You know Terran, and you have [[boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats) to Acid damage. Terrain composed of rubble, rocks, or dirt isn't [Difficult Terrain Xphb]] for you. In addition, you can move through solid earth or rock as if those areas were [[Difficult Terrain Xphb without disturbing the matter through which you pass. If you end your turn in solid earth or rock, you are shunted out to the nearest unoccupied space you last occupied. ## Spellcasting The ring has 5 charges and regains``dice: 1d4` + 1`expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can cast a spell from it. A spell cast from the ring has a save DC of 18. Choose the spell from the following list: [earthquake-xphb (spells)]] (5 charges), [[stone-shape-xphb (spells) (2 charges), [stoneskin-xphb (spells)]] (3 charges), [[Wall of Stone Xphb]] (3 charges) *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 292.
