- Suspicions about [Security Chief]] Wardwell's true agenda and loyalty
- Personal notes indicating [[Admiral Stormwind is actively investigating the same conspiracy #### **[Admiral Stormwind]]'s Arrival** Just as the PCs complete their evidence gathering, [[Admiral Stormwind arrives unexpectedly, having detected the intrusion through magical wards they were unaware of: **[The Admiral]]'s Entrance:** > [[Admiral Cassandra Stormwind enters the secured area with the quiet confidence of someone completely comfortable in their own domain. Her hand rests casually on her sword hilt, not threatening but ready, while her piercing grey eyes take in every detail of the scene. Despite the late hour, her uniform is impeccable, and her bearing suggests she's been expecting this encounter. **[Her Opening]] Words:**
* "I've been wondering when someone would finally come looking for the truth. The question is whether you're here as friends or enemies, and whether you're intelligent enough to recognize which category applies to your situation."* #### **[[The Revelation Scene** **Stormwind's Position:** * "For the past three months, I've watched my fleet being maneuvered into positions that serve no strategic purpose I can discern. Orders arrive through proper channels with correct authentication, but they contradict everything I know about naval strategy and Crown interests. I've been conducting my own investigation while pretending to follow directives that I suspect are designed to compromise the fleet's effectiveness and my own reputation."* **[Her Evidence]]:** [[Admiral Stormwind reveals her own intelligence gathering: - **[Communication Intercepts]]:** Foreign naval communications in Goldspire military codes
- **[[Personnel Analysis:** Detailed investigation of recently assigned crew members, particularly [Security Chief]] Wardwell
- **[[Strategic Assessment:** Analysis showing how recent fleet movements serve foreign rather than domestic interests
- **[Political Intelligence]]:** Information about court politics that suggests a coordinated conspiracy
- **[[Personal Concerns:** Growing certainty that someone intends to use the fleet in a plot against the Crown **[Her Situation]]:** * "I cannot act openly without concrete evidence that would convince naval command and the Crown. If I'm wrong, I commit treason by refusing orders and attacking my own people. If I'm right but act prematurely, the conspiracy will adapt and use my actions as justification for removing me and placing more compliant officers in command. I need allies who can operate independently and gather evidence I cannot collect through official channels."* #### **[[Mutual Interests** **[What Admiral]] [[Stormwind Offers:** - **[Naval Intelligence]]:** Access to fleet communications, crew assessments, and strategic analysis
- **[[Military Support:** Limited assistance that won't reveal the alliance or compromise her position

- **[Personal Assessment]]:** Does her behavior and demeanor suggest honesty or deception?
- **[[Strategic Logic:** accomplish her proposals create sense given the political and military situation?
- **[Risk Analysis]]:** What are the consequences of trusting her versus treating her as an enemy?
- **[[Alternative Options:** Are there other ways to achieve their objectives without her cooperation? **[Insight Opportunities]]:**
- **Insight **DC 16**:** [[Admiral Stormwind is genuinely concerned about the conspiracy and fleet security
- **Insight **DC 18**:** She's been under significant stress and isolation due to her suspicions

- **Perception **DC 17**:** Detect any signs of deception or hidden agendas #### **[[The Immediate Threat** During the alliance negotiation, [Security Chief]] Wardwell arrives with a security team, having detected the unauthorized presence in the Admiral's quarters: **Wardwell's Entrance:** > [[Security Chief [Helena Wardwell]] enters with three armed marines, her expression cold and professional. She moves with the calculated precision of someone accustomed to violence, and her eyes immediately assess the tactical situation. Her hand signals direct the marines to covering positions while she addresses [[Admiral Stormwind with barely concealed authority. **[Her Challenge]]:**
* "Admiral, you should have informed me of visitors to secure areas. Naval regulations require security notification for all unauthorized personnel accessing restricted spaces. I'll need to detain these individuals pending verification of their credentials and investigation of their activities."* #### **[[The Standoff** **[Power Dynamics]]:** - **Admiral's Authority:** Command position gives her ultimate authority over ship operations
