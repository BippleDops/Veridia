# Cause Fear

You awaken the sense of mortality in one creature you can see within range. A construct or an undead is immune to this effect. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become [frightened](/rules/conditions.md#frightened) of you until the spell ends. The [frightened](/rules/conditions.md#frightened) target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Classes**: Warlock, Wizard
