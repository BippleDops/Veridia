# Dimensional Anchor (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


## Effects
A green ray shoots out from your out-stretched hand and strikes one creature you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack to hit. On a hit, the creature is enveloped in a shimmering emerald field and is unable to move extradimensionally. This prevents the creature from using spells such as *arcane gate, dimension door, misty step, plane shift,* or *teleport.* It also prevents creatures from using natural abilities like a blink dog’s or balor’s teleportation.
