This folder contains a file called 'data.json'. This is a special database file that is used by the TTRPG Statblock Plugin to save monsters. You will need to copy this file into your vault replacing your existing data.json file. Shut down Obsidian. Copy the file over and then reopen Obsidian. 

Paste the file into:  ```YourVaultFolder\.obsidian\plugins\obsidian-5e-statblocks\```

**NOTE:** This is safe to do if you are using a fresh install of TTRPG Statblock. But if you have already added your own monsters to the file then you would lose your monsters if you did this without first backing up your data. It's quite easy to copy your data over. All you need to do it open the file in a Text Editor (Notepad++) and copy your content into the structure of the file provided here. 

This picture shows what data you would need to copy over for each monster. You can do all the monsters at once. Just note that you only copy everything from the ```[``` the stuff before that should already exist in the other file so you don't need to copy it twice.
