# The Frozen Throne
*Where Winter Never Ends*

> *"In the deepest cold where even the ocean freezes, there sits a throne of ice eternal, waiting for a ruler who will never come. They say the last queen still sits upon it, frozen in the moment of her greatest triumph and most terrible curse."*
> — [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Explorer Captain Reef Deepdiver, last known survivor of an expedition to the throne

## Overview

The Frozen Throne stands as one of [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]'s most mysterious and dangerous ruins, the abandoned palace-fortress of the ancient Ice Kingdom that once ruled the deepest, coldest regions of the ocean. Encased in supernatural ice that never melts despite the crushing depths, the palace remains perfectly preserved as it was 500 years ago when Queen Glacialis spoke the Curse of Eternal Winter that doomed her kingdom to save it from invasion. Now the throne room sits empty yet occupied, the palace halls echo with phantom footsteps, and the supernatural cold emanates outward, creating a zone of eternal winter in the deep ocean that few dare to explore.

## Secrets and Hidden Aspects

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Queen's Sacrifice
> Queen Glacialis is not actually dead but is maintaining the preservation spell through her living will and magical power. She is fully conscious and aware of everything happening in the palace, but cannot move or speak while maintaining the spell. She chose to preserve her people in the hope that someday someone would find a way to break the curse without killing everyone. She can communicate through dreams and visions with sensitive individuals, and desperately wants to be freed but fears that breaking the curse improperly would kill everyone she died to save.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The False History
> The common story about the Ice Kingdom being destroyed by warm-water invaders is only partially true. The real threat was an ancient entity called the Thaw Bringer, a primordial force of entropy and decay that was consuming the kingdom from within. The "enemy armies" were actually fleeing refugees from other areas that the Thaw Bringer had already consumed. Queen Glacialis created the curse not to preserve the kingdom from military defeat, but to create a zone of perfect stasis that the Thaw Bringer cannot penetrate. The entity is still out there, slowly consuming other parts of the ocean.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Living Palace
> The palace itself has developed a form of consciousness after 500 years of being infused with the queen's life force and magical energy. It is aware of visitors and can subtly manipulate its layout, creating new passages, hiding treasures, or revealing secrets based on its judgment of visitors' worthiness. The palace wants to protect its inhabitants and preserve the kingdom's legacy, but it's also lonely and curious about the outside world. It sometimes helps worthy visitors by guiding them to important discoveries or protecting them from dangers, but it will ruthlessly eliminate anyone it considers a threat to the frozen kingdom.
