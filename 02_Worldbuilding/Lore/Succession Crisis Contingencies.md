# Succession Crisis Contingencies
*The Fractured Crown and the Drowning Dynasty*

> *"When the Emperor scattered himself, he scattered the throne with him. Now we have seventeen ways to claim a crown that exists in seven pieces."*
> â€” Succession Scholar Thalassa Crownkeeper

## Current Succession Crisis

### The Scattered Emperor Problem
The current ruler, known as the Scattered Emperor, exists as seven distinct personality fragments across different locations. This unprecedented situation has created:
- **Legal Paradox:** Which fragment has legitimate authority?
- **Practical Crisis:** Multiple contradictory royal decrees issued simultaneously
- **Succession Chaos:** No clear mechanism for transition of power
- **Identity Crisis:** Who inherits from a ruler who isn't technically dead?

### The Seven Imperial Fragments
1. **The Crown Fragment (Throne Room):** Handles ceremonial duties, mostly catatonic
2. **The Sword Fragment (War Room):** Military decisions, increasingly aggressive
3. **The Scales Fragment (Treasury):** Economic policy, obsessed with accounting
4. **The Orb Fragment (Diplomatic Quarter):** Foreign relations, speaks in riddles  
5. **The Scepter Fragment (Parliament):** Legislative oversight, debates itself
6. **The Seal Fragment (Justice Chamber):** Legal matters, judges everything
7. **The Heart Fragment (Location Unknown):** Emotional decisions, whereabouts classified

## Succession Laws and Contradictions

### Traditional Succession (Pre-Scattering)
- **Primogeniture:** Eldest child inherits
- **Divine Right:** Ruler chosen by the Drowned God
- **Parliamentary Confirmation:** Senate must approve succession
- **Depth Trial:** Heir must survive ritual drowning at crushing depths

### Current Legal Framework Chaos

#### The Fragment Paradox
Each imperial fragment claims different succession rights:
- **Crown Fragment:** Says succession requires imperial reunion first
- **Sword Fragment:** Declares martial law, military succession
- **Scales Fragment:** Claims financial insolvency voids succession
- **Orb Fragment:** Argues diplomatic marriages change inheritance
- **Scepter Fragment:** Insists Parliament must choose successor
- **Seal Fragment:** States all claims are legally invalid until court ruling
- **Heart Fragment:** Unknown position (presumed emotional chaos)

#### Competing Legal Interpretations

**The Continuity Doctrine**
- Emperor technically never died, so no succession occurs
- Fragments maintain collective authority indefinitely
- Government continues in current fractured state

**The Dissolution Theory**
- Scattering constituted legal death/abdication
- Throne is vacant, normal succession applies
- Competing claims must be resolved through traditional means

**The Democratic Transition**
- Imperial fracture invalidates monarchy entirely
- Parliament assumes permanent authority
- Republic established by constitutional convention

**The Regency Solution**
- Appoint regent until Emperor can be reconstituted
- Maintain fictional imperial authority
- Avoid succession crisis through temporary measures
