# Bait and Switch
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 94*  

When you're within 5 feet of a creature on your turn, you can expend one Superiority Die and switch places with that creature, provided you spend at least 5 feet of movement and the creature is willing and doesn't have the [Incapacitated](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition. This movement doesn't provoke [Opportunity Attacks](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack).

Roll the Superiority Die. Until the start of your next turn, you or the other creature (your choice) gains a bonus to AC equal to the number rolled.
