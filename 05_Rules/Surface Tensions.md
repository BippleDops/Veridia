## Secrets and Hidden Aspects

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Secret Alliance
> [[Ambassador Marina Bridgewater]] is secretly part of a covert alliance of moderate leaders from both surface and underwater communities working to gradually move both sides toward full integration. They communicate through hidden channels and coordinate policies to create favorable conditions for peace, but they must be extremely careful not to be discovered by extremist factions or their own governments. The alliance includes high-ranking officials from multiple nations who are risking their careers and lives for the cause of peace.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Ancient Artifact
> Buried beneath the main diplomatic pavilion is an ancient artifact from before [[The Great Separation]], a crystal that amplifies emotional connections and promotes understanding between different species. The artifact's influence is subtle but real, contributing to the success of diplomatic negotiations. Only a few of the oldest residents know of its existence, and they've been secretly maintaining it while keeping its location hidden. If the artifact were destroyed or removed, diplomatic relations would become much more difficult.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Prophecy Cult
> A secret religious cult believes that the surface-underwater separation was prophesied and that any attempts at reunification will bring about a catastrophic apocalypse. The cult has infiltrated both surface and underwater organizations and is actively working to sabotage peace efforts. They are responsible for several "mysterious" accidents and failures that have hindered integration efforts. The cult believes they are saving both worlds from destruction, making them particularly dangerous because they see themselves as heroes.
