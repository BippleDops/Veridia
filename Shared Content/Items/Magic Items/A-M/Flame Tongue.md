## Description
You can use a [[12 - The Order of Combat|bonus action]] to speak this magic swordâ€™s command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed [[9 - The Environment|bright light]] in a 40-foot radius and [[9 - The Environment|dim light]] for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra `dice: 2d6` (2d6) [[17 - Damage and Healing|fire]] damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.
