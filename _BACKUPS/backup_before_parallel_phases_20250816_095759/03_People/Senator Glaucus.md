## Shadow Replacement

> *"Welcome to the depths where light drowns! Forgive me, that's not funny where you're from."*

### Physical Appearance
Senator Glaucus appears as a tall, unnaturally thin figure whose translucent skin reveals dark veins pulsing beneath. His eyes are completely black—no whites, no iris, just pools of darkness that seem to absorb light. When he moves, his shadow doesn't quite match his actions, often gesturing independently or remaining still when he walks.

### Before Replacement
The original Glaucus was a respected senator, advocate for surface-depth trade relations, and opponent of isolation policies. He investigated shadow anomalies three weeks ago and disappeared for two days.

### The Replacement
Three weeks ago, Glaucus was ambushed at the [[Reflection Pools and underwent forced shadow separation. His shadow gained independence and replaced him, while the original was imprisoned in the [The Memory Meadows]]. The shadow retained all of Glaucus's memories but none of his morality.

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Voice**: Soft and measured

**Speech Pattern**: Formal and elaborate

**Physical Habits**: Gestures expressively

### Immediate Goals
1. Pass the Shadow Citizenship Act (tomorrow's vote)
2. Identify party as threat or asset
3. Prevent discovery of imprisoned original
4. Facilitate Shadow Duchess's arrival

### Critical Information
1. **The Switch:** Happened at night exactly 21 days ago
2. **The Original:** Imprisoned in Memory Meadow kelp, slowly being forgotten
3. **The Tell:** His shadow moves 0.5 seconds before he does
4. **The Fear:** Terrified of true sunlight (would destroy him)
5. **The Weakness:** Saying original's true name three times causes pain

### Tells That He's a Shadow
1. Shadow moves independently
2. Never blinks
3. Avoids bright lights
4. Laughs at tragedy
5. Cold to the touch
6. No breath misting in cold
7. Doesn't cast shadow in shadow
