## Description
While you wear these boots, you can use a [[12 - The Order of Combat|bonus action]] and click the boots’ heels together. If you do, the boots double your walking speed, and any creature that makes an [[15 - Making an Attack|opportunity attack]] against you has [[2 - Advantage and Disadvantage|disadvantage]] on the [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.

When the boots’ property has been used for a total of 10 [[7 - Time|minutes]], the magic ceases to function until you finish a long rest.
