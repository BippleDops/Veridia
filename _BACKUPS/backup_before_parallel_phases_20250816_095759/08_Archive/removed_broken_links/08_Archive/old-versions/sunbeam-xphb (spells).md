*6th-level, Evocation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot Line)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a magnifying glass)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute You launch a sunbeam in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long [[Area of Effect Xphb. Each creature in the [Area of Effect Xphb]] makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes``dice: 6d8``Radiant damage and has the [[conditions#Blinded|Blinded condition until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only. Until the spell ends, you can take a [actions#Magic|Magic]] action to create a new [[Area of Effect Xphb of radiance. For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines above you. It sheds [Light Xphb]] in a 30-foot radius and [[Light Xphb for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight. **Classes**: [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 329.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of sunbeam xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around sunbeam xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Second Prophecy of Winds ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## Spell Components Detail
