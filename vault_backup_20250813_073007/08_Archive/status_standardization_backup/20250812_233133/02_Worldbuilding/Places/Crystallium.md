# Crystallium
*The Underwater Crystal Laboratory*

## Overview

Crystallium stands as [[Aquabyssos]]'s premier scientific research facility, a gleaming complex of crystal-glass laboratories and pressure chambers built 8,000 feet beneath the surface. Here, [[Master Crystallographer Aurora Prismheart]] leads the [[Crystal Academy Council]] in unlocking the secrets of crystal formation, pressure magic, and the mysterious interaction between [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s shattered [[Crown of Stars]] and the deep ocean environment.

The facility serves as both research institute and strategic resource, developing new technologies for [[Aquabyssos]] while maintaining extensive trade relationships with the surface world.

## Player-Facing Summary

Crystallium is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Crystallium as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Crystallium.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Crystallium to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at Crystallium to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to Crystallium active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
