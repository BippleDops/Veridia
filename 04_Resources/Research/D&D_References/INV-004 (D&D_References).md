--- # INV-004 *"Investigation 004: The case that changed everything we thought we knew."* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

INV-004 refers to the fourth major investigation conducted by inter-realm authorities into anomalous activities affecting both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. This particular case involved the mysterious disappearance of diplomatic personnel from both realms during routine trade negotiations, leading to discoveries about corruption networks operating across dimensional boundaries. ## Historical Background

Launched following the failure of three previous investigations to uncover the truth behind increasing diplomatic incidents, INV-004 was granted unprecedented authority to operate in both realms simultaneously. ## Current State

The investigation remains officially ongoing, though its findings have already led to significant changes in inter-realm security protocols and diplomatic procedures. ## Adventure Hooks

1. **New Evidence**: Characters discover information relevant to INV-004
2. **Cover-up Attempt**: Someone tries to suppress the investigation's findings
3. **Related Incident**: Similar pattern emerges requiring investigation ## Secrets (DM Only)

INV-004 uncovered evidence that some diplomatic incidents were orchestrated by entities from neither realm, suggesting external interference in inter-realm relations. ## Campaign Use

Provides framework for mystery adventures involving political intrigue and inter-dimensional crime. ## Player-Facing Summary INV 004 is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of INV 004 as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around INV 004. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A shipment has gone missing and war looms
