# Glyph of Warding (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
This is a new variant of the spell *glyph of warding* that appears in the *Playerâ€™s Handbook*, pg.245

***Sepia Snake Sigil.*** When triggered, a se-pia snake springs into being and attacks the nearest living creature (other than you) within 10 feet of it, using your spell attack modifier. On a hit, it engulfs the target in a shimmering amber field of force. The target is restrained and incapacitated. These conditions remain for 12 hours, until you release the creature, or a *dispel magic* spell is cast on it. While in the amber field, the creature does not age or need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep.
