## Description
This pale red wine leaves a tingle on the tongue. While the recipe for Saerloonian Special Vat is rumored to be over half raspberry and strawberry, with some grains added for smoothness and body, many claim this stable and untiring wineâ€™s full-bodied tones come from the special fermenting and aging processes used to make it. Hand keg, 6 sp; cask, 28 sp; barrel, 8 gp; butt, 23 gp; tun, 56 gp.
