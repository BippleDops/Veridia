## Description
Clean hands make for sure results. Water reservoirs not only clean hands but can cool overheated equipment and wash away acids. The top keg of our water reservoir is tapped into a shallow trough, tilted toward an open bucket on the other side. To dispense fouled water, merely lift the bucket and fling the liquid into the street. This reservoir is handy enough that some mages I know have even used it to begin bathing regularly. Our standard reservoir holds 20 gallons (20 gp), though we also sell 25-gallon (27 gp) and 50-gallon (37 gp) types.

## Additional Details
1 20-gallon water reservoir is required for a complete laboratory.
