# Druidic Warrior
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 120*  

**Prerequisite**: When Gaining the Level 2 Ranger "Fighting Style" Feature

You learn two Druid cantrips of your choice. [Guidance](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/guidance-xphb.md) and [Starry Wisp](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/starry-wisp-xphb.md) are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Ranger spells for you, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Ranger level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Druid cantrip.
