--- ### Depth Zones

The underwater realm is divided into distinct pressure zones, each with increasing dangers and requirements: | Depth | Zone Name | Pressure DC | Effects | Adaptation Required |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| 0-500 ft | Sunlight Zone | **DC 10** | Disadvantage on Perception | None |
| 500-1000 ft | Twilight Zone | **DC 12** | Exhaustion risk, darkvision required | Level 1 |

| 3000-6000 ft | Abyssal Zone | **DC 18** | Rapid exhaustion, madness risk | Level 3 |
| 6000-10000 ft | Hadal Zone | **DC 20** | Extreme pressure, reality distortion | Level 4 |
| 10000+ ft | The Void Depths | **DC 25** | Existential damage, identity loss | Level 5 | ### Pressure Saves

Underwater shadows behave differently: **Shadow Independence Stages**:
1. Consequently, **Depth 0-1000 ft**: Shadows behave normally
2. **Depth 1000-3000 ft**: Shadows lag behind movement

These mechanics create pressure (pun intended) for players to make difficult choices about adaptation. The system rewards gradual acclimation while punishing rapid changes. The social mechanics ensure that becoming adapted has roleplay consequences beyond just statistics. The interplay between crystal corruption and depth adaptation creates unique character development paths. Players must balance the benefits of adaptation against the loss of their surface identity. Remember: The mechanics serve the horror of transformation. Use them to enhance the narrative of losing humanity to the depths, not as a punishment system. ## Player-Facing Summary Aquabyssos Survival Mechanics is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Aquabyssos Survival Mechanics as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Aquabyssos Survival Mechanics. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Alliance - Manipulate succession ## Plot Hooks - A journal reveals a conspiracy about the government
