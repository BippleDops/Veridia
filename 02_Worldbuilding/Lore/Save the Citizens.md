# Save the Citizens

*"When disaster strikes, heroes answer the call of the innocent."*

## Overview
Save the Citizens represents emergency rescue operations where characters must protect and evacuate civilian populations during various catastrophes affecting both Aethermoor and Aquabyssos. These missions require coordination, resource management, and difficult decisions about who can be saved when time and resources are limited.

## Historical Background
Citizen rescue protocols developed after major disasters highlighted the need for organized emergency response. Early rescue attempts were often chaotic and resulted in unnecessary casualties.

## Current State
Modern rescue operations use improved coordination systems and magical enhancements, though they remain challenging when dealing with inter-realm disasters or supernatural threats.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
- Emergency situation affecting civilian population
- Rescue capabilities and transportation
- Medical/magical healing resources
- Coordination with local authorities

### Effects
- **Lives Saved**: Direct impact on survival rates
- **Community Reputation**: Affects standing with local populations
- **Resource Depletion**: Uses supplies and magical energy
- **Moral Consequences**: Difficult choices about rescue priorities

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Natural Disaster**: Earthquake or flood requires mass evacuation
2. **Monster Attack**: Citizens trapped during creature assault
3. **Magical Catastrophe**: Dimensional instability threatens populated areas

## Campaign Use
