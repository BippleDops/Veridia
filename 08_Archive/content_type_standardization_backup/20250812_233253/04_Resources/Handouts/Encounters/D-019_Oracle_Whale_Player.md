# Oracle Whale

A song like a mountain moves through you. Meanings hang in the water, waiting to be understood.

What you feel
- The hull vibrates with each note
- A strange calm—or fear—settles in

What you can try
- Listen closely and interpret
- Record the song
- Ward off poachers, if any

Possible outcomes
- You carry an omen forward
- The meaning slips away
- The truth is heavier than you hoped
