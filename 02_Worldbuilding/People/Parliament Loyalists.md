# Parliament Loyalists

*"Order through law, progress through tradition, strength through unity."*  
â€” Speaker Cassandra Deepcurrent, First Voice of the Loyalist Caucus

## Overview

The Parliament Loyalists are the dominant political faction within Aquabyssos' governing body, representing the interests of established noble houses, traditional guilds, and those who benefit from the current power structure. They advocate for strong central authority, incremental change, and the preservation of ancient customs that have guided Aquabyssos through centuries of prosperity.

Unlike revolutionary factions that seek radical transformation, the Loyalists believe that stability and gradual reform are the keys to maintaining Aquabyssos' position as a major power in both the surface and depth realms. They view themselves as the rational center against both the chaos of revolution and the stagnation of ultra-conservatism.

## The Marble Halls

The Parliament Loyalists operate from the prestigious Marble Halls, a complex of interconnected chambers carved from luminescent white stone within the Parliamentary District. The halls serve multiple functions:

- **The Caucus Chamber**: Where Loyalist representatives meet to coordinate policy
- **The Archive of Precedents**: Legal library containing centuries of parliamentary decisions
- **The Whispering Gallery**: Informal meeting spaces where deals are struck
- **The Treasury Vaults**: Where campaign funds and political favors are stored
- **The Portrait Hall**: Honoring past Loyalist leaders and their achievements

## Core Philosophy

The Parliament Loyalists operate on several key principles:

**Constitutional Order**: The parliamentary system, while imperfect, provides the best framework for governance and should be preserved and strengthened, not replaced.

**Guided Progress**: Change should come through established channels and legal processes, not through revolution or radical upheaval.

**National Unity**: Aquabyssos' strength comes from its diverse population working together under common law, not from factional division.

**Pragmatic Governance**: Policy decisions should be based on evidence, precedent, and practical considerations rather than ideology or emotion.

**Diplomatic Solutions**: International conflicts should be resolved through negotiation and treaty rather than warfare whenever possible.

- **The Academic Guild** - Scholarly institutions that benefit from their education policies
- **Traditional Noble Houses** - Core constituency and power base
- **The Professional Classes** - Lawyers, scribes, civil servants who benefit from the system

**Enemies:**

- **The Revolutionary Front** - Seeks to overthrow the parliamentary system entirely
- **Radical Religious Sects** - Oppose their moderate approach to faith and governance

## Current Challenges

### The Crystalborn Assassination
The murder of Lord Crystalborn by [[Assassin|Vespara Thorne]] has created a major crisis for the Loyalists. Crystalborn was a key moderate voice and bridge-builder between factions. His death has:
- Strengthened hard-line elements within the faction
- Created pressure for more aggressive action against threats
- Raised questions about the effectiveness of current security measures
- Provided ammunition for opponents who claim the Loyalists are weak

### The Shadow Corruption Crisis
Rising incidents of shadow corruption have put pressure on the Loyalists to take stronger action. However, their measured approach conflicts with public demands for immediate solutions, creating political vulnerability.

### Economic Pressures
While the Loyalists support the established economic order, growing inequality and new technological changes are creating pressure for more radical reforms than they're comfortable with.

### The Biomancer Problem
Their official condemnation of [[The Biomancers]] conflicts with the practical reality that some members secretly use their services. This hypocrisy threatens to expose fractures within the faction.

## Quest Hooks

1. **The Moderate's Dilemma** - The party is asked to investigate corruption within the Loyalist faction. They discover that some members are secretly dealing with [[The Biomancers]], but exposing this could destabilize the government.

2. **The Diplomatic Mission** - The Loyalists need the party to serve as unofficial ambassadors to Aethermoor, negotiating a trade agreement that could prevent war but might compromise Aquabyssos independence.

3. **The Constitutional Convention** - A crisis has called the government's legitimacy into question. The party must help organize and protect a constitutional convention while various factions try to manipulate or sabotage the proceedings.

4. **The Succession Crisis** - When Speaker Deepcurrent suddenly disappears, the party must uncover whether she was assassinated, kidnapped, or has fled due to scandal. The faction's unity hangs in the balance.

5. **The Information War** - Loyalist agents ask the party to help counter a propaganda campaign that's turning public opinion against the government. But as they investigate, they discover some of the accusations might be true.

6. **The Assassination Plot** - The party uncovers a plot to kill key Loyalist leaders. But the deeper they dig, the more they realize the conspiracy involves people from multiple factions, including some Loyalists themselves.

## Secrets and Conspiracies

### The Deep Accord  
Some Loyalist leaders have a secret arrangement with [[The Biomancers]]. They publicly condemn the organization while privately using their services for healing, enhancement, and information gathering. This deal provides the Biomancers protection from persecution in exchange for their loyalty.

### The Shadow Network
The Loyalists maintain an extensive intelligence network that operates in legal gray areas. While they publicly support transparency and rule of law, they engage in surveillance, blackmail, and manipulation to maintain power.

### The Succession Plan
There's a secret plan to gradually transform Aquabyssos from a parliamentary system to a constitutional monarchy, with Speaker Deepcurrent as the first monarch. Only the Inner Circle knows about this plan.

### The War Preparation
Despite their public commitment to diplomacy, the Loyalists are secretly preparing for potential military conflict with both surface revolutionaries and depth extremists. They've been quietly building up military resources and forging covert alliances.

### The Ancient Pact
The faction's origins trace back to an ancient agreement made with powerful entities from the deep ocean. This pact grants them certain protections and advantages, but also binds them to obligations they've kept secret for centuries.

## Internal Factions

### The Moderates (Plurality)
Led by Speaker Deepcurrent, they advocate for gradual reform and diplomatic solutions. They represent the faction's public face and official policies.

### The Traditionalists (Large Minority)  
More conservative members who resist any significant changes to the current system. They've grown stronger since the Crystalborn assassination.

### The Pragmatists (Small but Influential)
Members who are willing to compromise their stated principles for practical results. They're often involved in the faction's more questionable activities.

### The Reformists (Small but Growing)
Loyalists who believe the faction needs to embrace more significant changes to survive. They often find themselves at odds with the leadership.

## Roleplay Notes

**Typical Loyalist Personality**: Believes deeply in the system while acknowledging its flaws. Values stability, tradition, and gradual improvement. Often caught between idealism and pragmatism.

**Common Mannerisms**: References parliamentary procedure in casual conversation, speaks formally, tends to seek consensus and compromise, quotes legal precedent.

**Sample Dialogue**:
- "According to the Third Parliamentary Accord, we should consider all perspectives before proceeding."
- "This proposal lacks the proper supporting documentation and precedent."
- "Change is necessary, but it must be measured and deliberate."
- "The law exists to protect everyone, not just those who agree with it."
- "Sometimes the right choice is also the difficult choice."

**Typical Motivations**: Genuine belief in democratic governance, desire for social stability, personal ambition within the system, family tradition of public service, fear of chaos and disorder.
