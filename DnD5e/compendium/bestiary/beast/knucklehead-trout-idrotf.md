## Description

The tasty and tenacious knucklehead trout can't easily be caught in nets. Moreover, using a line to reel in such a strong fish is a significant undertaking. Incautious fishers who get pulled into freezing water can quickly die, particularly if they're weighed down by heavy furs and cloaks.

A male knucklehead trout can weigh 70 pounds or more. The females tend to be smaller, weighing about 50 pounds. Both are prized for their ivory-like bones.
