## Description
We strive to keep a superior assortment of cloaks on hand for the most demanding customer. We stock cloaks made of most common materials, as well as imported fabrics. Our stylish [[Dress|dress]] cloaks are very well made, with a variety of elegant clasps and [[Brooches|brooches]], and are suitable for most formal occasions (8-15 sp). We also have some cold weather full cloaks (2 gp), which are made of several layers of wool for added insulation, and which serve well as a [[Saddle|blanket]], too. Fur cloaks made of bear, wolf, raccoon, and other common animals are usually available (50 gp), and other types can often be acquired through special order (costs vary, starting at 150 gp). We offer several styles, with or without hoods, and even some specially designed cloaks with inner pouches and pockets to keep valuables inconspicuous. Anything custom designed like this doubles the cost. The colors available for cloaks are white, brown, black, grey, and forest green for all fabrics but silk, which comes in red, orange, yellow, blue, and violet for silk.
