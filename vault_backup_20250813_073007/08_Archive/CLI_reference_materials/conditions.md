If the effect has a maximum duration, the effect's description specifies how long the creator can concentrate on it: up to 1 minute, 1 hour, or some other duration. The creator can end Concentration at any time (no action required). The following factors break Concentration.

**Another Concentration Effect.** You lose Concentration on an effect the moment you start casting a spell that requires Concentration or activate another effect that requires Concentration.

## Player-Facing Summary

Conditions is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of conditions as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around conditions.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties conditions to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at conditions to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to conditions active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
