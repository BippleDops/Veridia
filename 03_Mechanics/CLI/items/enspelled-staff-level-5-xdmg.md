# Enspelled Staff (Level 5)
*Staff, weapon, very rare (requires attunement by a Spellcaster)*  


- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties.md#Versatile)
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

Bound into this staff is a level 5 spell. The spell is determined when the staff is created and can be of any school of magic. The staff has 6 charges and regains `d6` expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can expend 1 charge to cast its spell. If you expend the staff 's last charge, roll `d20`. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical [Quarterstaff](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/quarterstaff-xphb.md).

The spell's saving throw DC is 17, and its attack bonus is `+9`.
