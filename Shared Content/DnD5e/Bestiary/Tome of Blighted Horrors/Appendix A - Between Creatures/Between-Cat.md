*Vaguely feline, this hairless, pale creature has wrinkled, flaccid skin, a pair of stunted vestigial limbs extending from its flanks, and a ring of small tentacles around its neck. Its clawed forepaws each bear one wickedly hooked claw much larger than the others. Its eyes are dark voids, and a long, prehensile tongue extends from its mouth.*

## Special Traits
**Dislocated:** The Between-cat’s form is made up of memories, which shift and change. The creature is continually under the effect of a blur spell (attacks against it are made with tactical disadvantage unless the attacker has blindsight, truesight, or an equivalent). The Between-cat can suppress or reactivate this ability at will as a bonus action.

**Dual Existence (recharge 4-6):** The Between-cat can pass easily back and forth between the Between and the mundane world at will (no action required). This allows it to teleport up to 60 feet to a space it can see, or to escape into the Between until it chooses to return to the mundane world.

**Nulltropy:** A creature slain by a nulltropic claws attack can return to life only through a wish or true resurrection spell.

**Shapechanger:** In the Between, the Between-cat always assumes its natural shape. In other worlds, it appears as a normal cat unless it uses an action to adopt its natural shape, which it must maintain through concentration, like a spell.

**Spell-like Abilities:** The Between-cat can use the following spell-like abilities, using Intelligence as its casting ability (DC 15). The cadaver doesn’t need material components to use these abilities.

*At will:* comprehend languages, tongues

*1/day:* detect magic, glyph of warding

Cats have often enjoyed a vaguely mysterious and sinister reputation throughout many cultures, and the Between-cat may be the most deserving of this reputation. Catlike in name only due to its vaguely feline appearance, some scholars question whether Between-cats began as normal cats and were changed through exposure to the Between. Others think they are actual creatures of the Between that managed to gain a catlike appearance through their intimate contact with the mundane world, while some believe they are some entirely unrelated species that simply evolved concurrently to resemble the more mundane varieties of cats. Whatever the case, it seems that Between-cats hold no special affinity for true felines, and yet are able to move among them completely unnoticed by other cats without raising any alarm when in their mundane cat forms. Whatever the reason for their existence and their relationship to mundane felines, Between-cats are one of the few creatures that enjoys seemingly complete freedom in moving between the natural world and Between.

While their full agenda is not known, two facts about Between-cats are recognized among the most learned of scholars. First, they ceaselessly search through venerable tomes, petroglyphs, and other ancient writings in search of some unknown secret or secrets that they have revealed to no one. Second — whether related to the first item or not — Between-cats seek to completely unmake reality for their own hidden reasons. Nulltropic damage from their claws, amplified by the presence of other Between-cats, induces a loss of order and energy in the target and produces an overall breakdown of substance toward nothingness. More than mere entropy, which simply describes the loss of order and cohesion, the nulltropy of the Between-cat brings about a complete loss of existence in any form, albeit on a tiny scale. Armed with their nulltropic attack, Between-cats can accomplish their goal of unmaking reality one tiny piece at a time.

Fortunately for the sake of reality and all who live in it, the nulltropic damage caused by a single Between-cat is minuscule, and they are loathe to use it indiscriminately. They instead save it for enemies in battle or for certain artifacts and writings they have found over the years, as well as for aboleths, whom they consider bitter enemies. However, when more Between-cats get together, their nulltropic attack becomes terrifying. Thankfully, no one has ever reported encountering more than 56 Between-cats in one place. There is speculation, however, that if more did gather, then the nulltropic damage they could cause would continue to scale to an ever-accelerating degree. Most sober-minded theoreticians refuse to think too long on the dreadful implications of this line of thought.
