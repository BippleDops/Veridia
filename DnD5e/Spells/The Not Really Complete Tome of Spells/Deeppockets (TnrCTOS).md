**School**: *transmutation*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

## Effects
You touch a pocket that has been sewn into an existing garment and turn it into an extradimensionally large container. It can hold up to 100 pounds of objects but weighs no more than 10 pounds. The objects must fit into the mouth of the pocket.

When the spell expires, the objects suddenly pour out of the pocket. You can also command the objects to pour out in the same manner at any time.
