*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 192. Available in the Free Rules (2024)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/races/img/goliath.webp#right) - **Ability Scores**: None
- **Type**: humanoid
- **Size**: Medium
- **Speed**: 35 ft. ### Giant Ancestry You are descended from Giants. Choose one of the following benefitsâ€”a supernatural boon from your ancestry; you can use the chosen benefit a number of times equal to your [[Proficiency Xphb]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long-rest-xphb]]: - **Cloud's Jaunt (Cloud Giant).** As a [[Action Xphb]], you magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. - **Fire's Burn (Fire Giant).** When you hit a target with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can also deal`d10`Fire damage to that target. - **Frost's Chill (Frost Giant).** When you hit a target with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can also deal`d6`Cold damage to that target and reduce its [[Fly Speed Xphb]] by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. - **Hill's Tumble (Hill Giant).** When you hit a Large or smaller creature with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can give that target the [[conditions#prone|Prone]] condition. - **Stone's Endurance (Stone Giant).** When you take damage, you can take a [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules)]] to roll`d12`. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled and reduce the damage by that total. - **Storm's Thunder (Storm Giant).** When you take damage from a creature within 60 feet of you, you can take a [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules)]] to deal`d8`Thunder damage to that creature. ### Large Form Starting at character level 5, you can change your size to Large as a [[Action Xphb]] if you're in a big enough space. This transformation lasts for 10 minutes or until you end it (no action required). For that duration, you have [[Advantage Xphb]] on Strength checks, and your [[Fly Speed Xphb]] increases by 10 feet. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a [[long-rest-xphb]]. ### Powerful Build You have [[Advantage Xphb]] on any ability check you make to end the [[conditions#Grappled|Grappled]] condition. You also count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Description Towering over most folk, goliaths are distant descendants of giants. Each goliath bears the favors of the first giantsâ€”favors that manifest in various supernatural boons, including the ability to quickly grow and temporarily approach the height of goliaths' gigantic kin. Goliaths have physical characteristics that are reminiscent of the giants in their family lines. For example, some goliaths look like stone giants, while others resemble fire giants. Whatever giants they count as kin, goliaths have forged their own path in the multiverseâ€”unencumbered by the internecine conflicts that have ravaged giantkind for agesâ€”and seek heights above those reached by their ancestors. ## Player-Facing Summary Goliath xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of goliath xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around goliath xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## References - [[05 Chapter 4 Character Origins]]
