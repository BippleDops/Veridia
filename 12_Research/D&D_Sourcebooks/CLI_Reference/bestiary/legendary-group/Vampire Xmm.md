## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing a vampire's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Children of the Night.** The vampire exerts influence over the animals in its domain. From dusk until dawn, Medium or smaller Beasts have the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] condition while within 1 mile of the lair.  
- **Looming Shadows.** Shadows within 1 mile of the lair seem to move as if alive. Any creature (excluding the vampire and its allies) that finishes a [[short rest xphb|Short Rest]] while within 1 mile of the lair must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain no benefit from that rest.  
- **Mists.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is [[lightly obscured xphb|Lightly Obscured]] by a persistent, creeping fog. The vampire and any creatures of its choice are unaffected by the fog.  

If the vampire dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

## Player-Facing Summary

Vampire xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of vampire xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around vampire xmm.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
