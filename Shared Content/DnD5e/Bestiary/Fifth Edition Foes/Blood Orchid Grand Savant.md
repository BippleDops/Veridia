A swarm of writhing, pallid tentacles dangle from its underside: there are 16 manipulator arms and eight thinner tendrils with red eyes at the ends. A second cluster of eye tendrils rises from its back.*

## Special Traits

**All-Around Vision:** A [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Blood Orchid|blood orchid]] sees in all directions at once. Enemies never gain tactical advantage or bonus damage against a [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Blood Orchid|blood orchid]] because of the presence of allies.

**Telepathic Bond:** [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Blood Orchid|Blood orchids]] communicate through a nonmagical telepathic bond. They can sense emotions in other [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Blood Orchid|blood orchids]] at distances up to 100 feet, can communicate fully with each other through telepathy at a distance of 20 ft. or less, and can share vast amounts of information almost instantly when touching each other. They can sense emotions in other types of creatures when touching them or within 5 feet.

**Spellcasting:** [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Blood Orchid|Blood orchid]] grand savants are spellcasters who can cast the spells listed below. They use Charisma as their casting ability (DC 17, attack +9) and don’t require material components.

- Cantrips (at will): *chill touch, light, mage hand, minor illusion*

- 1st Level (x8): *burning hands, color spray, cure wounds, mage armor, magic missile, shield*

- 2nd Level (x7): *crown of madness, mirror image, phantasmal force, scorching ray*

- 3rd Level (x5): *lightning bolt, vampiric touch*

## Actions

**Multiattack:** The [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Blood Orchid|blood orchid]] attacks six times, in any combination of tentacle slams and blood drain.

**Tenticle Slam:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (`dice: 1d10+4`) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled.

**Blood Drain:*** Melee Weapon Attack:* automatic hit, reach 5 ft., one creature already grappled by the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Blood Orchid|blood orchid]] at the start of the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Blood Orchid|blood orchid]]'s turn. Hit: 10 (`dice: 2d8`) piercing damage, and the target must make a successful DC 16 Constitution saving throw against poison or become unconscious. Unconscious characters can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns; they regain consciousness on a successful save. A creature that makes a successful save against this attack becomes immune to the blood drain's unconsciousness effect for 24 hours.

## Ecology

**Environment**: Underground

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description

[[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Blood Orchid|Blood orchids]] are territorial, xenophobic, and possessive. They rarely form alliances with other creatures, as their alien mindset keeps them from forming any common ground. They regard other races as aberrant and not to be trusted, even other lawful creatures.

Communication for [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Blood Orchid|blood orchids]] is through a means of empathy/ telepathy. They have no sense of hearing, which helps render them immune to sonic effects. The [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Blood Orchid|blood orchid]] can close its outer petals downward and rest on the ground, where it resembles a rocky nodule or fungus of some kind.

[[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Blood Orchid|Blood orchids]] occasionally develop sorcerous talents and transform into savants. When their abilities reach a certain level, they can evolve into a grand savant. Normally, each colony of [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Blood Orchid|blood orchids]] is led by a single grand savant, and another can’t evolve while one is present. A [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Blood Orchid|blood orchid]] savant ready to become a grand savant leaves the colony with a few followers and sets out to establish a new brood elsewhere.
