# D-L-03 Deep Mother Dream Tide

## Read-Aloud
> One by one, the crew grows quiet. The ship hums an old lullaby no one remembers learning.

## Setup
- Zone: Abyss • Category: Mythic Dream Event
- Stakes: City-wide dreaming; identity shifts; prophecy arc

## Mechanics
- Group Sanity DC 17 to resist immersion
- Religion/Arcana DC 16 to interpret visions
- Optional: Memory trade (choose a minor memory to gain a boon)

## Outcomes
- Success: Party gains prophecy tokens (up to 2); Integrity +2 locally for 24h
- Partial: Mixed omens; personal hooks seeded
- Fail: Mass short-/long-term madness; splinter cult emerges

## Integrations
- [[Sanity System]]; [[Memory Trading Economy System|Memory Economy]]; [[Deep Mother]]

## Scaling
- With shrine-ship: reduce Sanity DC by 1

## Variants
- Tide offers a bargain: lose one cherished memory for a great boon

## Quick-Run
- Sanity→Interpretation→apply boons or madness; add prophecy hook
