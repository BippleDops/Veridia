# Pressure's End - The Iron Deep

## Overview
Carved into a massive underwater cliff face at 3,500 feet depth, Pressure's End is the military heart of Aquabyssos World Overview. This fortress-city serves as headquarters for the [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Depth Wardens and stands as the last major defense against the horrors rising from [02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Hadal Depths]]. Built from reinforced stone and pearlsteel, it's the only city that has never fallen to deep-sea invasion.

## Districts

### The Garrison Deeps
Military quarter housing the [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Depth Wardens' barracks, training grounds, and armories. [02_Worldbuilding/People/Admiral Thorne Blackwater]] commands from the Strategic Depth Chamber, a room where pressure can be adjusted to simulate any depth.

### The Forge Trenches
Industrial district where [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Master Smith Vulcan Deepforge oversees the creation of pressure-resistant weapons and armor. The forges burn with eternal flame preserved from before [02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Great Drowning]].

### Civilian Shelf
Terraced residential area for non-military citizens. [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Quartermaster Judith Steadfast manages supplies and ensures military families are provided for.

### The Lock
High-security prison carved deeper into the cliff, where dangerous criminals and deep-creatures are held. [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Warden Marcus Stonehand]] maintains order through brutal efficiency.

### The Watchtower Depths
Observation posts extending into the darkness below, staffed by scouts and diviners watching for threats from the deep.

## Notable Locations

### The War College
Training academy for elite Depth Wardens. [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Commander Drake Pressureborn instructs in deep combat techniques and psychological resistance to [02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Deepmind]].

### The Depth Chapel
Fortified temple where [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Battle Priest Cassius Depthshield blesses weapons and soldiers before deep patrols. Dedicated to gods of war and protection.

### The Pressure Chamber
Medical and experimental facility where [02_Worldbuilding/People/Doctor Helena Voidwalker]] studies the effects of extreme depth on body and mind. Also used for interrogation.

### The Strategic Archive
Military intelligence center containing maps of the deep trenches and records of every deep incursion. [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Spymaster Crow coordinates intelligence operations from here.

### The Titan Dock
Massive bay housing the city's war-leviathans, giant creatures trained for deep combat. [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Beast Master Krell Chainbreaker]] maintains these living weapons.

## Services & Shops

### The Drowned Soldier Tavern
Veterans' gathering place run by [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Retired Captain Bron Saltbeard. Information about deep threats traded freely here.

### Irondeep Supplies
[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Merchant Viktor Geargrind]] sells military-grade equipment to authorized buyers. Secretly supplies resistance groups opposing military rule.

### The Pressure Seal
Inn catering to deep scouts and travelers, run by [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Innkeeper Mara Ironlung. Each room can be pressurized to match any depth.
