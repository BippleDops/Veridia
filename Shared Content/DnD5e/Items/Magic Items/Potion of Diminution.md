# Potion of Diminution

## Overview
**Type**: Magic Item

**Group**: *Potions*

**Rarity**: *Rare*


## Description
When you drink this potion, you gain the “reduce” effect of the **[[Enlarge_Reduce|enlarge/reduce]]** spell for `dice: 1d4` (1d4) hours  (no [[2 - Casting a Spell|concentration]] required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the [[Glass Bottle|bottle]] fails to interrupt this process.
