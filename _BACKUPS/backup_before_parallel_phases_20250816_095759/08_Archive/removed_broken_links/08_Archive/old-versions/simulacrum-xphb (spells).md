--- # Simulacrum

*7th-level, Illusion* - **Casting time:** 12 hours
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (powdered ruby worth 1,500+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled You create a simulacrum of one Beast or Humanoid that is within 10 feet of you for the entire casting of the spell. You finish the casting by touching both the creature and a pile of ice or snow that is the same size as that creature, and the pile turns into the simulacrum, which is a creature. It uses the game statistics of the original creature at the time of casting, except it is a Construct, its [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules) maximum is half as much, and it can't cast this spell. The simulacrum is [friendly-attitude-xphb (variant-rules)]] to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your commands and acts on your turn in combat. The simulacrum can't gain levels, and it can't take Short or Long Rests. If the simulacrum takes damage, the only way to restore its [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules) is to repair it as you take a [long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]], during which you expend components worth 100 GP per [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules) restored. The simulacrum must stay within 5 feet of you for the repair. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 [hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]], at which point it reverts to snow and melts away. If you cast this spell again, any simulacrum you created with this spell is instantly destroyed. **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 317.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of simulacrum xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around simulacrum xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## Spell Components Detail
