## Description
The blood hawk is nearly identical to a normal hawk and is often mistaken for one, but a blood hawk is stronger and far more aggressive than a normal hawk. Blood hawks love the taste of human flesh and are relentless in their hunt for human prey. They often steal gems from the corpses of their humanoid prey, which they use to decorate their nests.

Blood hawks are fierce combatants that quickly swoop down on their prey to attack with their razor-sharp talons and beak. Once they attack and get the taste of flesh in their beaks, blood hawks seldom retreat.
