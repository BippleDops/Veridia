Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* Ghasts frequently organize ghouls into packs to despoil crypts and steal the wealth within. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Ghasts *Tyrants among Corpses* - **Habitat.** Swamp, Underdark, Urban - **Treasure.** Any Ghasts are reeking, undying corpses closely related to ghouls. They hunger for the vices they enjoyed in life as much as they do for rotting flesh.```statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of ghast xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around ghast xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## References - [[Maurezhi Mpmm]]
