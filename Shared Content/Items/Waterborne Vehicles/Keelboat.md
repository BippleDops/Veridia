# Keelboat

## Overview
**Price**: 3,000 gp

**Speed**: 1 mph

**Rowed Vessels.** Keelboats and rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per [[7 - Time|hour]]) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles canâ€™t be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A [[Rowboat|rowboat]] weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over land.
