## Description
These bent rods strap comfortably to the legs, allowing a thief to sink the barbed ankles into most any wood surface. Traditionally used by lumbermen, climbing irons also work very effectively on the corners of wooden buildings. Of course, though they aid climbing, they hamper getaways— I’ve seen many a thief running bow-legged from a crime scene to avoid bloodying his ankles.

## Additional Details
+7 bonus to Climb Walls; -3 penalty to normal movement until removed
