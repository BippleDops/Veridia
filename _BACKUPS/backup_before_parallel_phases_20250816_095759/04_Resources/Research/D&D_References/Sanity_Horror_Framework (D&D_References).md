- X-card for content boundaries
- Lines and veils discussion
- Regular check-ins
- Fade to black option
- Aftercare discussions --- *"Madness is not the absence of sanityâ€”it is the presence of too much truth. The mind breaks not from lies, but from seeing reality as it truly is."*
- Patient Zero, Abyssos Prime Asylum ## Player-Facing Summary Sanity Horror Framework is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Sanity Horror Framework as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Sanity Horror Framework. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - An heirloom has gone missing and truth emerges
