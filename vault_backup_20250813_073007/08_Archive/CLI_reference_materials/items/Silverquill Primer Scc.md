# Silverquill Primer
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  



The Silverquill Primer is a magic textbook created at Strixhaven's Silverquill College. The primer has 3 charges, and it regains `d3` expended charges daily at dawn. If you make a Charisma ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Intimidation|Intimidation]]) or a Charisma ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Persuasion|Persuasion]]) check while holding the primer, you can expend 1 charge to give yourself a `d4` bonus to the check, immediately after you roll the `d20`.

In addition, if you study the primer at the end of a long rest, you can choose one 1st-level spell from the bard or cleric spell list. Before you finish your next long rest, you can cast the chosen spell once without a spell slot if you are holding the primer. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.
