  "revised_prompt": "Create a highly detailed concept art of an ancient brass dragon in a visually intriguing environment that merges the sky and an underwater realm. The dragon, depicted in motion, should be set against the backdrop of a human silhouette. Highlight the dragon's unique musculature and limb structure. The scene colours should be defined by a three-colour palette of teals, deep blues, and sea-greens, with occasional pearl highlights. The dragon's habitat should be culturally coherent with medieval fantasy, supplemented with carefully designed gear. Draw attention to the aquatic realism, representing subsurface caustics and bioluminescent accents. The environment should display pressure-dome materials typical of a traditional tabletop fantasy setting similar to D&D 5e. Avoid modern technology, modern signage, photoreal CGI, anime style, and bloom glare. Ensure that the style of the illustration remains consistent and painterly. Do not include any garbled or random strings of letters but use meaningful symbols, if required.",
