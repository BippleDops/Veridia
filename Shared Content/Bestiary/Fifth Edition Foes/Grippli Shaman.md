## Special Traits
**[[Grippli|Grippli]] Shaman:** Any large group of [[Grippli|gripplis]] (12 or more) will be accompanied by one or more tribal shamans. A grippli shaman has heightened Wisdom (13) and the ability to cast the following spells, using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability (DC 11, attack +3). It doesn’t need material components to cast these spells.

- Cantrips (at will): *druidcraft, guidance*

- 1st level (x4): *animal friendship, entangle, fog cloud, goodberry*

**[[Grippli|Grippli]] Poison:** A target hit by a poisoned grippli dart must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for `dice: 1d4` rounds. At the end of the last turn of poisoning, the target repeats the saving throw. A successful save means the target recovers, but a failed save means the target becomes paralyzed for `dice: 1d6` rounds. A successful saving throw does not make the target immune to later poisonings.

**Swamp Stride:** [[Grippli|Gripplis]] can move across mud, muck, shallow water, and any other difficult terrain that arises from the presence of water without penalty.

## Actions
**Shortsword:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d6+3`) piercing damage.

**Dart:** *Ranged Attack:* +5 to hit, range 20 ft./60 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d4+3`) piercing damage. If poison is used, see [[Grippli|grippli]] poison, above.

**Net:** *Ranged Attack:* +5 to hit, range 5 ft./15 ft., one creature. Hit: The target is restrained until it makes a successful DC 10 Strength check or until 5 slashing damage is done to the net (AC 10). Targets of Huge size or larger are not affected.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Warm forests and marshes

**Organization**: Gang (2–5), pack (6–11), or village (20–30 plus 6–11 noncombatants)

## Description
[[Grippli|Gripplis]] are short, froglike humanoids that dwell in swamps, marshes, and rainforests. They can move upright or on all fours. They spend most of their time scooting about their community doing many of the same tasks that humans perform in their own towns.

A [[Grippli|grippli]] stands 2 to 2–1/2 feet tall. Its eyes are yellow with vertical pupils of black. Gripplis often wear brightly colored clothes and gaudy, decorative jewelry and other adornments. They are fond of brightly colored items of all kinds.

Gripplis are peaceful, thoughtful, nonaggressive, creatures who attack only when threatened or frightened. They prefer to keep their distance and attack using their nets and darts. If engaged in melee, gripplis employ short swords. Some gripplis coat their darts with paralytic poison before entering battle, but this practice is not universal; it largely depends on how much trouble this tribe of gripplis has experienced from outsiders recently. A grippli village is organized much like a human village. Each grippli family maintains its own dwelling. Their huts are small, constructed of wood and mud. Gripplis build them beneath the branches of large trees to shade themselves from long, hot, tropical days. Every grippli village is led by a tribal leader (usually a female) who is considered the wisest among them, and has one or more shamans (always female) who cast spells similar to druids.

Gripplis are enthusiastic traders with other more gregarious races such as elves and halflings and with peaceful fey. They are also skilled hunters in their swampy or forested territory. Gripplis are fond of fruit and insects (including the giant varieties), and they are very responsible about collecting and storing supplies in their villages against seasonal shortages and lean times.

Gripplis reproduce by laying eggs. They reproduce slowly, with a typical clutch containing but one egg. For this reason, the normally peaceful gripplis defend their young with a ferocity that surprises even those races of humanoids with a reputation for cherishing their children.
