## Special Traits
***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the merregon's darkvision.

***Magic Resistance.*** The merregon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The merregon makes two halberd attacks, or if an allied fiend of challenge rating 6 or higher is within 60 feet of it, the merregon makes three halberd attacks.

***Halberd.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 ( `dice: 1d10+4`) slashing damage.

***Heavy Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ( `dice: 1d10+2`) piercing damage.

## Reactions
***Loyal Bodyguard.*** When another fiend within 5 feet of the merregon is hit by an attack, the merregon causes itself to be hit instead.

## Description
The souls of fallen soldiers, mercenaries, and bodyguards who served evil without reservation often find everlasting servitude in the Nine Hells as merregons. These faceless foot soldiers are the hells' legionnaires, tasked with protecting the realm and its rulers against intruders.

***Masks of Uniformity.*** Merregons have no individuality, and hence no need for faces. Every merregon legionnaire has a metal mask bolted to its head. Markings on the mask indicate the only elements of the wearer's identity that matter: its commander and the layer of the Nine Hells it serves.

***Fearless Obedience.*** Because of their unshakable loyalty, merregons form the backbone of many devils' protective retinues. They shrink from no task, no matter how dangerous. Unless ordered to fall back, they retreat from no fight.
