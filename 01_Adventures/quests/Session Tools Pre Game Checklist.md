Adapt as needed for your group's style and needs.* ## Player-Facing Summary Pre Game Checklist is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Pre Game Checklist as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Pre Game Checklist. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related * Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Second Prophecy of Depths ## Related Notes - [[Similar Topic 1|Similar Topic 1]] - [[Contrasting Approach|Contrasting Approach]]
