# Infestation
You cause a cloud of mites, fleas, and other parasites to appear momentarily on one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it takes `dice: 1d6|avg` (1d6) poison damage and moves 5 feet in a random direction if it can move and its speed is at least 5 feet. Roll a d4 for the direction: 1, north; 2, south; 3, east; or 4, west. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if the direction rolled is blocked, the target doesn't move.

The spell's damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (`dice: 2d6|avg` (2d6)), 11th level (`dice: 3d6|avg` (3d6)), and 17th level (`dice: 4d6|avg` (4d6)).
