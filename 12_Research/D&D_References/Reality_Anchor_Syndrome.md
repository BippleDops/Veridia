- +2 saves vs. illusion and transmutation
- Disadvantage on Deception checks (too honest)

#### Stage 2: Anchor Point
- Create 10-foot stability zone 1/day
- Immune to forced movement
- Cannot benefit from teleportation magic

#### Stage 3: Reality Foundation
- Permanent *Dispel Magic* aura (10 feet)
- Advantage on saves vs. all magical effects
- Cannot use magic items requiring attunement

#### Stage 4: Cosmic Pillar

- Cannot leave current plane of existence

### Complications
