# Gnoll
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 282*  


- **Ability Scores**: str +2 int -2
- **Size**: Medium
- **Speed**: 30 ft.

## Traits

### Bite

Your fanged maw is a natural weapon, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with it, you deal piercing damage equal to `d4` + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

### Darkvision

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Rampage

When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on your turn, you can take a bonus action to move up to half your speed and make a bite attack.

## Player-Facing Summary

Gnoll dmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of gnoll dmg as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around gnoll dmg.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties gnoll dmg to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at gnoll dmg to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to gnoll dmg active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
