# Rastor's Mystical Spy (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *divination*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a copper brooch)

**Duration**: 6 hours


## Effects
You cast this spell on a copper brooch and give it to another creature to wear. As long as that creature is wearing the brooch, you can use your action to see and hear anything that creature is seeing and hearing. This spell only works if the creature is actively wearing the brooch (it wonâ€™t work if the creature merely has the brooch on its person) and is within five miles of you.
