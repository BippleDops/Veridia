# Propeller Helm

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** uncommon

**Attunement**: *requires attunement* by a small humanoid

## Description

While worn, the helm allows its wearer to use an action to cast the [[levitate]]  spell, requiring no components. The helm's propeller spins and whirs loudly until the spell ends. Each time the spell ends, there is a ***50 percent*** chance that the helm loses its magic and becomes nonmagical.
