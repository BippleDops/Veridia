# Log Slammer
## Overview
*Mechanical trap*
Two heavy logs hidden by foliage or cobwebs at opposite ends of an area are set to swing together when the tripwire is triggered

The tripwire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the tripwire or the logs. A DC 15 Dexterity check made with thieves' tools breaks the tripwire harmlessly. A character without thieves' tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or tool. On a failed check the trap triggers.

The creature who triggered the trap must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or be caught between the logs as they slam together. On a failed save that creature takes 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage. A creature who saves takes half damage.
