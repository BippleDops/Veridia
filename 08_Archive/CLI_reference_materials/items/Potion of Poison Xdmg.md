# Potion of Poison
*Potion, uncommon*  


- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing-xdmg|Potion of Healing]] or another beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/identify-xphb|Identify]] reveals its true nature.

If you drink this potion, you take `4d6` Poison damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition for 1 hour.
