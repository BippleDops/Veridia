# Vaporize (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *8th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a bit of ash and spit-tle)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You pick a point within range. All rock, earth, stone, metal, crystals within a 20-foot radius cube that is centered on that point vanish, turned into a dense, billowing fog that eventually evaporates. The fog provides light concealment and can be blown away with a stiff breeze.

Creatures made of rock, earth, metal, or crystal must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 10d10 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.
