# Introduction
*Source: Plane Shift: Dominaria* 

> [!quote]- A quote from James Wyatt  
> 
> By the time you read this, you'll have heard news of the forthcoming publication of Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica, which I privately refer to as "Plane Shift: Ravnica." That book is the primary reason that this installment of the Plane Shift series is relatively late, because the D&D part of my brain was occupied with working on it. But that book is also the culmination of all the work I've done on this series over the last couple of years. Plane Shift—and your overwhelmingly positive response to it—paved the way for the hardcover Ravnica book, by proving that a D&D/Magic crossover was something that people wanted to see. So your delight and enthusiasm for this pet project is directly responsible for the Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica coming later this year. Thank you! When I started working on the D&D team at Wizards of the Coast in 2000, there was already some talk of doing a crossover product between D&D and Magic: The Gathering. At the time, Magic was more or less synonymous with the world of Dominaria. So in a way, this installment of the Plane Shift series is over eighteen years in the making. This work isn't comprehensive, of course. As always, The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Dominaria is the definitive resource, but even that book could only scratch the surface of Dominaria. The art book was built on the world guide, and the world guide specifically chose ten regions of the world—two per mana color—as a focus for the card set. Of those ten regions, seven are either located on or around the continent of Aerona or have a significant impact on it. For that reason, I made the decision in this article to focus on the Domains, omitting the regions of Urborg, Shiv, and Yavimaya. I figured that leaving those out would diminish the temptation for characters to circumnavigate a globe that includes so many regions already omitted from the art book. That said, the art book includes a complete map, and the Internet is home to abundant information about Dominaria (especially on the Magic Website (https://magic.wizards.com/en)). So if you want to expand your campaign beyond Aerona, you should have little trouble doing so. There's not a lot of rules content in this article, largely because Dominaria is as close as Magic comes to the classic fantasy that D&D draws from. Feel free to make extensive use of class options, monsters, and other parts of the fifth edition D&D rules (which you can find here (https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules)). Once more, thanks for showing so much support for the Plane Shift series, and for making possible the even more exciting projects to come!

## The Domains

Dominaria is an enormous plane, with numerous landmasses separated by vast oceans. This article, though, focuses on the continent of Aerona and its surrounding lands, which are collectively known as the Domains.

### Aerona

The continent of Aerona is sharply split between its northern and southern parts, with the division marked by a wide bay and a forbidding mountain range.

The southern part of Aerona is dominated by **Benalia**, the foremost mercantile and military power on Dominaria. It spreads along the western coast and out to the nearby islands, including the Isle of Avenant to the north and much of the Spice Isles to the west. Though most famous for their fertile fields, the lands of Benalia also include old-growth forests, rolling mountains, and a lengthy coastline.

The skies above Benalia are dotted with the curved, floating spires of the **Church of Serra**, with a heavy concentration of them above Benalia City. In stark contrast to the beneficence of the church, agents of **Belzenlok's Cabal** have been infiltrating Benalia from their stronghold to the east, in Urborg.

South and east of Benalia lie the impassable tangles of the **Llanowar** forest. Llanowar is populated by diverse elven societies that are threatened by the goblins and orcs of the Ironclaw Mountains.

Land passage through Benalia to the east coast of Aerona is virtually impossible thanks to the peaks of the Ironclaws, but the Benalish are the preeminent naval power in the region. By informal but frequently reiterated agreement, Benalish ships stay out of the Voda Sea, and the merfolk of **Vodalia** allow shipping to pass along Aerona's coastlines largely unhindered. This command of Aerona's southern coasts allows the Benalish to maintain a permanent presence in Sursi on the east coast of the continent.

To the northeast of Benalia are the Red Iron Mountains, which divide the more sparsely populated northern half of Aerona from the lands to the south. The mountains' native Crookshank kobolds fared poorly during the chaos of the Rift Years, and the mountains are now dotted with Benalish mining settlements.

To the east, the Red Iron Mountains divide as the continent does, with the Ironcrowns veering off to the south. The northern branch becomes the formidable peaks of the Hurloon Mountains, home of a peaceful but reclusive nation of minotaurs. The occasional Benalish trading mission ventures into Hurloon, but permanent settlements and Serran missionaries are met with open hostility.

### Icehaven

The forbidding subcontinent north of Aerona is Icehaven, home to the warrior nation of **Keld**. Keldon raiders and Benalish colonists now clash regularly along the west coast of northern Aerona, both seeking to control the relatively narrow stretch of land between the Sea of Avenant and the Whispering Woods to the east.

### Spice Isles

West of Benalia spreads a vast ocean dotted with islands. The most prominent of the **Tolarian Academies**, Tolaria West, is situated in the northwestern Spice Isles. (A second Tolarian Academy is situated on Walassa to the east of Aerona, part of the mercantile empire of Orvada.)
