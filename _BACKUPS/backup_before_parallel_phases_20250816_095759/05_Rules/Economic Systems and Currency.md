## Player-Facing Summary

The economic systems spanning Aethermoor and Aquabyssos represent a complex web of currencies, ficial institutions, and trading mechanisms that facilitate commerce across two dramatically different realms. Understanding these systems opens opportunities for legitimate business success, criminal profit, political influence, and adventure across multiple economic sectors.

## Lore Details

Ancient texts speak of the first currencies emerging from the depths, where pressure-forged coins were said to contain the memories of the deep-sea gods. Surface dwellers developed crystal-backed money as a response, believing that the magical resoce of crystals could protect wealth from the corrupting influence of the abyss.

Legend holds that the most successful merchants are those who can speak the hidden languages of money - understanding not just exchange rates and profit margins, but the deeper currents of de[Sire]], fear, and ambition that truly drive economic systems. Some say that in the deepest vaults of the richest banks, ancient coins still whisper secrets of forgotten civilizations and lost treasures.

## [[DM_Notes|DM Notes

Use the economic systems as a foundation for complex political intrigue, allowing players to engage with [Power Structures]] through ficial means rather than just combat. The multi-layered currency systems provide opportunities for sophisticated plots involving market manipulation, cross-realm politics, and criminal enterprises. Consider how economic events can drive campaign storylines and create consequences that extend far beyond immediate ficial gain or loss.

The criminal ficial networks offer alternative paths for character development and plot advancement, while the legitimate economic systems provide a framework for understanding how society functions and how player actions might affect broader political and social stability.
