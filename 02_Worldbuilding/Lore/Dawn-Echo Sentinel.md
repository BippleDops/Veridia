*"When first light touches deep water, the guardian awakens to its vigil."*

## Overview
The Dawn-Echo Sentinel is a unique magical construct that activates at sunrise, using the resonance between surface dawn and underwater acoustics to patrol and protect designated areas. This sentinel combines light-based magic with sonic abilities, creating protective barriers and warning systems that function across the boundary between realms.
