# Rockslide
*Generic Hazard*  

When a rockslide occurs, every creature in its path makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 11 (`2d10`) Bludgeoning damage, has the [[conditions#Prone|Prone]] condition, and moves with the rockslide. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

When the rockslide stops, its space becomes [[difficult-terrain-xphb|Difficult Terrain]], and all Prone creatures in its space are buried under rocks and debris. A creature buried in this way has the [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition and has [[cover-xphb|Total Cover]]. As an action, a creature can try to crawl out from under the rock pile. If the creature succeeds on a DC 15 Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check, it is no longer Restrained; instead, it has the [[conditions#Prone|Prone]] condition and is atop the rock pile. If the check fails, the creature remains buried and gains 1 [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] level.

A creature that has neither the Incapacitated nor the Restrained condition can spend 1 minute freeing another creature buried by the rockslide.

## At Higher Levels

You can scale this hazard for higher levels by increasing the Bludgeoning damage as follows: 22 (`4d10`) at levels 5–10, 55 (`10d10`) at levels 11–16, and 99 (`18d10`) at levels 17–20.
