# Captain Nautilus the Deep Wanderer
*Explorer of the Mother's Domain, Mapper of Divine Dreams*

## Overview
Captain Nautilus has spent decades exploring the deepest reaches of Aquabyssos, charting the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Hadal Depths]] and mapping the physical form of the sleeping [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]].

**Depth Master.** Nautilus can survive at any depth without equipment and cannot be harmed by water pressure. He can breathe water as easily as air and has perfect mobility underwater.

**Deep Mother's Blessing.** Nautilus is protected by the Deep Mother's divine power. When he would take damage that would reduce him to 0 hit points, the Deep Mother intervenes (3/day), reducing the damage to 1 instead and teleporting him to safety if possible.

**Divine Navigation.** Nautilus always knows his exact location relative to the Deep Mother's body and can sense changes in her vital signs from anywhere in the world. He cannot become lost while underwater.

**Pressure Mastery.** As a bonus action, Nautilus can manipulate water pressure in a 60-foot radius around him. He can create barriers of compressed water (AS 20, 50 HP), crush enemies, or propel himself at incredible speed.

**Sacred Mission Compulsion.** Nautilus is driven by unbreakable divine purpose to map the Deep Mother and warn of her awakening. This grants him advantage on Wisdom saves and makes him immune to charm and fear effects.

**Spellcasting.** Nautilus is an 18th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks). He knows the following spells:

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Nautilus makes three attacks: two with his Deep Currents and one Water Lance, or he can cast a spell and make two Deep Current attacks.

**Deep Current Strike.** *Melee Spell Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (2d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away and knocked prone by a surge of deep ocean current.

**Water Lance.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +14 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (4d6 + 8) piercing damage. The attack ignores cover and underwater movement penalties.

**Pressure Crush (Recharge 5-6).** Nautilus creates a crushing sphere of water pressure around a creature within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, they take 36 (8d8) force damage and are restrained until the end of their next turn. On a success, they take half damage and aren't restrained.

**Deep Mother's Warning (1/Day).** Nautilus channels the Deep Mother's voice to deliver a prophetic warning. All creatures within 120 feet must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. Those who fail are stunned for 1 round by visions of the Deep Mother's awakening and its consequences.

**Summon Deep Wanderers (1/Day).** Nautilus calls forth 2d4 Deep Wanderer scouts (use modified merfolk stats with 60 HP each and pressure immunity). They serve loyally for 1 hour or until dismissed.

### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)
Nautilus can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.

**Move.** Nautilus moves up to his speed, potentially swimming through the air in underwater environments.

**Deep Current.** Nautilus makes one Deep Current Strike attack.

**Pressure Manipulation.** Nautilus uses his Pressure Mastery ability to create barriers or move creatures.

**Cast Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Nautilus casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.

**Divine Insight (Costs 3 Actions).** Nautilus gains perfect knowledge of the current status and location of all creatures within 1 mile, as well as any changes in the Deep Mother's condition.

### Lair Actions
When encountered in the Deep Mother's vicinity or at one of his observation posts, Nautilus can take lair actions on initiative count 20:

**Awakening Tremor.** The Deep Mother's stirring causes the entire area to shake. All creatures except Nautilus must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

**Divine Pressure.** The area fills with crushing divine pressure. All creatures except Nautilus must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (4d6) force damage and have their movement speed reduced by half until the end of their next turn.

**Deep Echo.** The Deep Mother's heartbeat echoes through the area. All creatures must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of their next turn as they comprehend the vast scale of the sleeping goddess.
