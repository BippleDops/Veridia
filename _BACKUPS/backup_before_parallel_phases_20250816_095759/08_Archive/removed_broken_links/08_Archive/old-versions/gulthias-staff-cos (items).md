--- # Gulthias Staff

*Staff, weapon, rare (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/gulthias-staff.webp#right) - **Damage**: - One-handed: `dice: 1d6` bludgeoning - Two-handed: `dice: 1d8` bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[item properties#Versatile|Versatile
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs. Made from the branch of a Gulthias tree (see the [Twig Blight Xmm]] entry of the Monster Manual), a Gulthias staff is a spongy, black length of wood. Its evil makes beasts visibly uncomfortable while within 30 feet of it. The staff has 10 charges and regains``dice: 1d6` + 4`of its expended charges daily at dusk. If the staff is broken or burned to ashes, its wood releases a terrible, inhuman scream that can be heard out to a range of 300 feet. All blights that can hear the scream immediately wither and die. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Vampiric Strike The staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff. On a hit, it deals damage as a normal quarterstaff, and you can expend 1 charge to regain a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt by the weapon. Each time a charge is spent, red blood oozes from the staff's pores, and you must succeed on a **DC 12** Wisdom saving throw or be afflicted with [[Short Term Madness (see "[madness|Madness]]" in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). ## Blight Bane While you are attuned to the staff, blights and other evil plant creatures don't regard you as hostile unless you harm them. *Source: Curse of Strahd p. 221* ## Player-Facing Summary Gulthias staff cos is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of gulthias staff cos as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around gulthias staff cos. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Second Prophecy of Shadows ## Related Notes - [[Similar Topic 1
