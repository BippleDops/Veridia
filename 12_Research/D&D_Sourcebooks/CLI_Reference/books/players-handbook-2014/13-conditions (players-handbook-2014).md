# Conditions
*Source: Player's Handbook (2014), p. 289* 

Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as [[conditions#Blinded|blinded]], are impairments, but a few, such as [[conditions#Invisible|invisible]], can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the [[conditions#prone|prone]] condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

For a full list of the conditions, see the conditions page. The conditions are:- [[conditions#Blinded|blinded]]  - [[conditions#Charmed|charmed]]  - [[conditions#Deafened|deafened]]  - [[conditions#Exhaustion|exhaustion]]  - [[conditions#frightened|frightened]]  - [[conditions#Grappled|grappled]]  - [[conditions#Incapacitated|incapacitated]]  - [[conditions#Invisible|invisible]]  - [[conditions#Paralyzed|paralyzed]]  - [[conditions#Petrified|petrified]]  - [[conditions#Poisoned|poisoned]]  - [[conditions#prone|prone]]  - [[conditions#Restrained|restrained]]  - [[conditions#Stunned|stunned]]  - [[conditions#Unconscious|unconscious]]

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
