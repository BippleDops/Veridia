# Keoghtom's Ointment
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/keoghtoms-ointment.webp#right)

This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains `1d4 + 1` doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh 1/2 pound.

As a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action, you can swallow one dose of the ointment or apply it to a creature within 5 feet of yourself. The creature that receives it regains `2d8 + 2` [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] and ceases to have the [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition.
