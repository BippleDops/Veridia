# The Mourning Depths - Where Sorrow Never Ends
*The Deepest Place of Grief in All the Oceans*

> *"In the deepest places where light never reaches, where pressure would crush any normal soul, there exists a realm built from pure sorrow. The Mourning Depths call to every heart that has known loss, promising that here, at least, grief is understood, honored, and given form that will last forever."*
> — [[Deep Sea Explorer Captain Abyss]], *Final Log Entry*

## Overview

The Mourning Depths represent the deepest accessible region of [[Aquabyssos]], a vast abyssal plain where sorrow has taken physical form and grief itself has become the foundation of civilization. Located at crushing depths of 8,000-12,000 feet below the surface, this realm exists as both a sanctuary for those who seek to process loss and a dangerous place where sorrow can consume visitors entirely. The Depths are home to the most melancholy inhabitants of the deep ocean, beings who have transcended ordinary emotion to become living embodiments of grief, regret, and remembrance.

Built around the philosophy that sorrow, properly channeled, becomes the most powerful creative force in existence, the Mourning Depths produce the ocean's most beautiful art, most profound philosophy, and most effective memory preservation techniques. However, the price of this beauty is steep—many who come to the Depths to process their grief never leave, becoming permanent residents who gradually lose themselves in eternal mourning.

## Secrets and Hidden Aspects

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Sorrowmaster's True Identity
> The Sorrowmaster is actually not a single individual but a collective consciousness formed from the merger of the original Catastrophe survivors. This collective has existed for nearly 1,000 years, continuously growing by incorporating the consciousness of those who achieve ultimate grief. The proxies who speak for the Sorrowmaster are individuals in the process of being absorbed into this collective consciousness. This secret is known only to the deepest levels of the Council of Mourners and explains why the Sorrowmaster's wisdom and authority seem unlimited.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Memory Tide Pool Connection
> The Memory Tide Pools are not natural formations but are actually direct connections to the collective unconscious of everyone who has ever died in the ocean. They serve as a window into the afterlife memory realm where the consciousness of the deceased continues to exist. This connection is what makes memory preservation so effective in the Mourning Depths, but it also means that preserved memories retain some connection to the living consciousness of the deceased. Skilled memory workers can sometimes communicate with the dead through preserved memories, but this knowledge is carefully guarded to prevent exploitation.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Shadow-Grief Synthesis
> The increasing shadow density in the Mourning Depths is not contamination but evolution. Shadows and grief are naturally compatible forces, and their combination is creating a new form of existence that transcends both life and death. Some of the deepest residents are voluntarily undergoing this synthesis, becoming shadow-grief beings with abilities beyond normal mourning culture. This process may represent the next stage of evolution for the Mourning Depths, but its implications for the rest of [[Aquabyssos]] are unknown and potentially dangerous.
