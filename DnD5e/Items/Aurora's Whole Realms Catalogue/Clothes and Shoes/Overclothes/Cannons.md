## Description
Among the most fashionable types of modern [[Breeches|breeches]], our cannons fit tightly to legs from the waist to the ankles, providing full flexibility, warmth, and comfort. Our cannons are laced together in front and contain a slim belt to hold up the waistband. They come only in velvet or silk, the latter doubling the cost. For velvet cannons, the prices run as follows: gnome (5 gp), halfling (6 gp), elf (8 gp), human (10 gp). Please specify ecto-, meso-, or endomorphic and color when ordering: white, brown, beige, gray, or black (dyeing is available).
