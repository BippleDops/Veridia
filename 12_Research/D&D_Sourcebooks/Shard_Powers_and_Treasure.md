### Power Scaling Philosophy
The Seven Shards represent ultimate cosmic power, but each comes with significant costs. Players must weigh the benefits against corruption risks, creating meaningful choices throughout the campaign.

### 5e Integration Strategy
All mechanics use existing 5e frameworks where possible, with unique elements clearly marked. This ensures compatibility with official content while maintaining the campaign's unique flavor.

### Reward Pacing
Rewards escalate from uncommon items in early sessions to legendary artifacts by campaign's end, but corruption and curse mechanics prevent power creep from breaking game balance.

### Player Agency
The corruption system and shard powers give players meaningful choices about character development, with no "correct" path through the campaign's challenges.
