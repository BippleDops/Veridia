![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/dragontooth-dagger.webp#right)

- **Damage**: 1d4 piercing
- **Range**: 20/60

A dagger fashioned from the tooth of a dragon. While the blade is obviously a fang or predator's tooth, the handle is leather wrapped around the root of the tooth, and there is no crossguard.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. On a hit with this weapon, the target takes an extra `d6` acid damage.

## Draconic Potency

Against enemies of the Cult of the Dragon, the dagger's bonus to attack and damage rolls increases to 2, and the extra acid damage increases to `2d6`.
