# Shadow Bazaar
*The Twilight Market, Merchants of the Void, The Between-Worlds Exchange*

## Overview
The Shadow Bazaar operates as [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s premier interdimensional marketplace, specializing in goods and services that exist in the liminal spaces between realities. Part commercial enterprise, part secret society, the Bazaar facilitates trade in shadow-touched items, memories, identities, and experiences that cannot be found in conventional markets.
