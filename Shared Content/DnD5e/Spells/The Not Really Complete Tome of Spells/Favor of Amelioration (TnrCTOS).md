# Favor of Amelioration (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Special


## Effects
Granted by both gods of pain and of protection, this spell has two uses; you must choose which you will use when casting the spell:

♦ ***Banish Pain.*** One willing creature you choose within range is freed from pain. For a duration of Concentration, up to 10 minutes, the target is immune to unconsciousness and the poisoned condition (although it will still take damage from the poison), and if it takes 15 damage or less and it would be reduced to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.

♦ ***Transfer Damage.*** You transfer up to 20 hit points to an injured creature within range, or take up to 20 hit points from an uninjured creature within range to heal your injuries. If the creature is unwilling, it must make a Constitution saving throw to resist.
