**Layers of Hades**

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Oinos | A land of dead-gray ash, stunted trees, and virulent disease is stalked by roving bands of Fiends looking for a fight or recruits for the Blood War. |
| Niflheim | Gray pine trees blanket rolling hills and rocky bluffs, and thick mists coil around their trunks. |
| Pluton | Shriveled willows, olive trees, and poplars contribute to the gloom of this concentration of the deepest despair in the multiverse. |
