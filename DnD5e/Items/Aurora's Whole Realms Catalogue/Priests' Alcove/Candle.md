## Description
Though most folk use [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Household Accoutrements/Candles|candles]] merely for light, priests use them as powerful tools of faith. Our altar [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Household Accoutrements/Candles|candles]] are 3 inches in diameter and come in lengths from 1 to 6 feet (4 gp per foot). As well as accenting holy sites, the 6-foot altar [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Household Accoutrements/Candles|candles]] can burn for weeks on end.

We also offer 8-hour vigil [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Household Accoutrements/Candles|candles]] (10 gp each) which, when burned through the night beside an injured person, work medicinal effects through their [[Incense|incense]].

Our 12-hour [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Household Accoutrements/Candles|candles]] (4 sp each) sell more than any other variety and, for an additional gp can be inscribed to indicate the passage of hours and half-hours.

## Additional Details
Temples of Lathander use two 6-foot altar [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Household Accoutrements/Candles|candles]] per fortnight; a vigil candle allows 1 extra point of healing to creatures in a 10-foot radius if tended for 8 hours by a wakeful priest
