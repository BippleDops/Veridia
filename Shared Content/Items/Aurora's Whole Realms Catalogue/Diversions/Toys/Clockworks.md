## Description
Made in the fabled island nation of Lantan by the craftworking Gondsmen, these small (2"-long) [[Toys|toys]] look like birds, animals, and fish. Their delicate [[Metal|metal]] shells are crammed with springs and wires, so that the birds fly, the animals scurry along the ground, and the fish can swim, all for short distances. The [[Metal|metal]] is painted and draped with streamers. These are beautiful and fragile [[Toys|toys]], so order more than one. All clockworks are tested by our salespeople before delivery to ensure that they work correctly (and because THEY enjoy playing with the [[Toys|toys]] as well). Clockworks cost 2 gp each, or get a selection of 10 for 15 gp!
