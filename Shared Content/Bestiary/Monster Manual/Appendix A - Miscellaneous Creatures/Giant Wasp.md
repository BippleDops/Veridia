## Actions
***Sting.*** Sting. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d6+2`) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (`dice: 3d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the poison damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
