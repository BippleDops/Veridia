## Description
This flat iron [[Rod|rod]] has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to [[Strength|push]] the button again, the rod doesnâ€™t move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and [[9 - The Environment|fall]]. A creature can use an action to make a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 30 [[Strength|Strength]] check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.
