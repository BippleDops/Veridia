--- # Menagerie

*Level 13 Bastion facility* - **Prerequisites**: None
- **Space**: Vast (36 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 2
- **Order**: recruit A Menagerie has enclosures big enough to contain up to four Large creatures. Four Small or Medium creatures can occupy the same space as one Large creature there. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Recruit: Creature When you issue the "Recruit" order to this facility, you commission the facility's hirelings to add a creature from the Menagerie Creatures table to your Menagerie. The recruitment takes 7 days and costs you the amount listed in the table. The hirelings look after the creature. Creatures in your Menagerie count as Bastion Defenders. Deduct any you lose from your Bastion Defenders roster. You can choose not to count one or more of these creatures as Bastion Defenders, in which case they can't be called on to defend the Bastion. Instead, they act in accordance with their nature and use their stat blocks in the "Monster Manual". **Menagerie Creatures** | Creature | Size | Cost |

^menagerie-creatures With the DM's consent, you can add different creatures than those shown in the Menagerie Creatures table to your Menagerie. The cost of a creature depends on its Challenge Rating, as shown on the Creature Costs by Challenge Rating table. Typically only Beasts and some Monstrosities can be kept in a Menagerie, though the DM might allow other creatures. **Creature Costs by Challenge Rating** | Challenge Rating | Cost |
|------------------|------|
| 0 or 1/8 | 50 GP |
| 1/4 | 250 GP |
| 1/2 | 500 GP |
| 1 | 1,000 GP |
| 2 | 2,000 GP |
| 3 | 3,500 GP |

^creature-costs-by-challenge-rating *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 343* ## Player-Facing Summary Menagerie is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of menagerie as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around menagerie. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## References - [[Special Facility Descriptions Special Facilities Xdmg]]
