# Sorrow-Root Nightbloom

*"Nature doesn't need saving - it needs revenge. The crystals are a cancer, and I am the cure, no matter how much cutting is required."*

## Overview
Once a member of [[The Verdant Accord]], Sorrow-Root Nightbloom now leads the Withered Court, a radical splinter faction that believes the only way to save nature is to weaponize it against civilization. They've begun experimenting with controlled corruption to create "crystal-eating" plants.

## Appearance
- Bark-like skin with crystalline veins spreading like a disease
- Hair made of withered vines with occasional crystal flowers
- One eye natural green, the other a swirling crystal purple
- Wrapped in robes made from crystal-corrupted plant matter
- Carries a staff grown from a tree that absorbed an [[Aether Crystal]]

## Personality
- Speaks in whispers that carry impossible distances
- Shows affection only to plants and corrupted nature
- Views people as either fertilizer or tools
- Maintains an unsettling calm even when committing atrocities

## Relationships
- **[[Archdruid Thornweaver]]**: Former mentor, now bitter enemy - Thornweaver considers them an abomination
- **[[High Inquisitor Maltheos]]**: Unlikely temporary alliances when their anti-crystal goals align
- **[[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]**: Has sent assassin vines after her multiple times
- **[[Ambassador Korvin Blacktide]]**: Fascinated by their corruption experiments, secretly funds their research
- **[[Zephyr Goldwhisper]]**: Their terrorist attacks affect trade routes, making them bad for business

## Current Activities
- Creating hybrid crystal-plant organisms as weapons
- Poisoning water supplies near crystal mining operations
- Building an army of corrupted treants in the deep [[The Verdant Reach]]
- Seeking the [[Verdant Shard]] to corrupt it into a weapon of mass devastation

## The Withered Court
A growing faction of druids, rangers, and fey who believe that:
- Civilization must fall for nature to survive
- Crystal corruption can be turned against itself
- The [[The Seven Shards]] should be destroyed or corrupted beyond use
- Anyone who uses crystals deserves death

## DM Secrets
> [!warning] The Green Death
> Sorrow-Root has successfully created a fungal plague that feeds on crystal energy. Released in a populated area, it would kill anyone with any crystal exposure (nearly everyone) within days. They're waiting for the right moment to deploy it.

> [!danger] The True Horror
> Sorrow-Root isn't entirely wrong - they've discovered that the crystals are actually eggs of an extraplanar parasite. Their extreme methods might be the only thing preventing an even worse catastrophe, making them a villain who might be accidentally saving the world.

> [!info] Hidden Humanity
> Sorrow-Root maintains a secret garden where they keep one uncorrupted tree from their childhood home. If it dies or is corrupted, they plan to release the Green Death immediately. This tree is their last anchor to sanity.
