# Investment of the Chain Master
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 156*  

**Prerequisite**: Level 5 Warlock

When you cast [Find Familiar](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/find-familiar-xphb.md), you infuse the summoned familiar with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the following benefits.

## Aerial or Aquatic

The familiar gains either a [Fly Speed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/fly-speed-xphb.md) or a [Swim Speed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/swim-speed-xphb.md) (your choice) of 40 feet.

## Quick Attack

As a [Bonus Action](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), you can command the familiar to take the [Attack](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Attack) action.

## Necrotic or Radiant Damage

Whenever the familiar deals Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can make it deal Necrotic or Radiant damage instead.

## Your Save DC

If the familiar forces a creature to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC.

## Resistance

When the familiar takes damage, you can take a [Reaction](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to grant it [Resistance](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) against that damage.
