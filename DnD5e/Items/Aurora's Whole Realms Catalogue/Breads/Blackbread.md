## Description
The sweetest, strongest molasses from Amn is used in our exclusive blackbread. Wastel flour, the finest grind available, forms the basis for these tasty loaves. After the first taste, you will agree that these donâ€™t need any topper! Sold in lots of four; sad to say, we cannot split lots. Blackbread, 4 loaves: 10 sp.
