# Major Curse (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour


## Effects
You touch a creature, and it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose the nature of the curse from the following options:

♦ Choose one ability score. That ability is reduced to 3.

♦ The creature had disadvantage on all attack, damage, and saving throws.

♦ The creature is paralyzed for the dura-tion of the spell.

♦ All attacks and spells deal an addi-tional 1d12 necrotic damage to the target.

♦ The creature begins to slowly die. Af-ter every long rest, it takes 1d10 damage of a type of your choice and its hit point total is reduced by 1 point. Its total is restored to normal only after this curse is lifted.

♦ Whenever the creature encounters a particular substance, it becomes incredibly nauseated. It must make a Constitution sav-ing throw or become incapacitated for 2d6 rounds due to vomiting and dry heaves and be poisoned for 10 minutes.

A *remove curse* ends this effect. At the DM’s option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more power-ful than those described above. The DM has final say on the curse’s effect.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th-level spell slot, the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Using a spell slot of 7th level or higher grants a duration that doesn’t require concentration.
