--- # Rope of Entanglement

*Wondrous item, rare* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/rope-of-entanglement.webp#right) This rope is 30 feet long. While holding one end of the rope, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to command the other end to dart forward and entangle one creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have the [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition. You can release the target by letting go of your end of the rope (causing the rope to coil up in the target's space) or by using a [[Action Xphb]] to repeat the command (causing the rope to coil up in your hand). A target [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] by the rope can take an action to make its choice of a DC 15 Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) or Dexterity ([[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]) check. On a successful check, the target is no longer [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] by the rope. If you're still holding onto the rope when a target escapes from it, you can take a [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules)]] to command the rope to coil up in your hand; otherwise, the rope coils up in the target's space. The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and [[immunity-xphb (variant-rules)]] to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]]. If the rope drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]], it is destroyed. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 301.
