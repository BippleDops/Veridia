_Source: Princes of the Apocalypse_ If Gar is in the water node while [[Olhydra Pota isn't, he can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Gar uses a lair action to use his Multiattack or cast one of his spells, up to 3rd level, without using components or a spell slot. He can't cast the same spell two rounds in a row, but he can continue to concentrate on a spell he previously cast using a lair action. He can take no other lair actions while [conditions#Concentration|concentrating]] on a spell cast as a lair action. His favorite use of this capability is casting [[Inflict Wounds Xphb or [Call Lightning Xphb]]. If Gar casts [[mass-cure-wounds-xphb (spells) using this lair action, he regains the maximum number of hit points from the spell (28). ## Player-Facing Summary Gar shatterkeel pota is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of gar shatterkeel pota as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around gar shatterkeel pota. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Hidden Prophecy of Stars ## Plot Hooks - Strange disappearances suggest a conspiracy
