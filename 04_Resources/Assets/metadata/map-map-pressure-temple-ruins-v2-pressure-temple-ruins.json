The top-down tactical map illustrates passable, impassable, and difficult terrains with distinct patterns. Include features such as ramps, staircases, ledges, and contour lines, and various flanking options. Decorate it with an aquatic theme, incorporating a palette of teals, deep blues, sea-greens with pearl highlights. Do not embed any text labels, and avoid any elements of modern signage, sci-fi interfaces, photoreal CGI, anime style, or glaring bloom. Please also keep a clear margin and maintain areas suitable for VTT overlays.",
