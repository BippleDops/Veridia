--- # Sickening Radiance

*4th-level, Evocation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes Dim, greenish light spreads within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The light spreads around corners, and it lasts until the spell ends. When a creature moves into the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take``dice: 4d10``radiant damage, and it suffers one level of [[conditions#Exhaustion|exhaustion and emits a dim, greenish light in a 5-foot radius. This light makes it impossible for the creature to benefit from being [conditions#Invisible|invisible]]. The light and any levels of [[conditions#Exhaustion|exhaustion caused by this spell go away when the spell ends. **Classes**: [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]] *Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 164* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Sickening radiance xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
