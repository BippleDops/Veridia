## Overview

The Shrinking Sanctuary exists as a dimensional pocket carved from [Aquabyssos]]' reality itself - a miracle of magical engineering that provides perfect safety to refugees fleeing the realm's many dangers. Created five years ago by desperate dimensional mages during a particularly violent period, this pocket dimension initially offered ten square miles of habitable space, complete with breathable water, comfortable pressure, and isolation from external threats.

However, the Sanctuary carries a terrible burden: it shrinks at a constant rate of five cubic feet per hour. What began as a spacious haven for thousands has become an increasingly crowded refuge for hundreds. The mathematics are unforgiving - at the current rate, the space will become too small to sustain human life within two years.

The Sanctuary represents the ultimate expression of [[Aquabyssos' post-Catastrophe ingenuity - a place where impossible engineering meets desperate humanity, where the same magical forces that provide perfect protection are slowly destroying the very thing they were meant to preserve.

## Secrets and Hidden Aspects

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Intentional Design
> The sanctuary's shrinking is not a design flaw but an intentional feature included by its creator, the dimensional mage [[Architect Temporal Wisdom. She believed that permanent magical protection would make refugees dependent and weak, preventing them from eventually reintegrating with the outside world. The shrinking mechanism was designed to force inhabitants to develop strength, cooperation, and eventually seek new solutions rather than becoming permanent dependents on magical safety. Only [Keeper Temporal Safehaven]] knows this truth, discovered in hidden documentation, and the knowledge weighs heavily on his conscience as he watches the community struggle with their seemingly doomed situation.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Faith-Stability Connection
> The sanctuary's dimensional stability is partially maintained by the collective faith and hope of its inhabitants. The more people believe in their community's future and maintain hope for survival, the more stable the dimensional boundaries become - but despair and hopelessness actually accelerate the shrinking process. This creates a cruel paradox where knowledge of the sanctuary's mathematical doom makes that doom more likely to occur. Some of the Sanctuary Keepers have realized this connection and are working desperately to maintain community morale through carefully managed information, constant encouragement, and morale-boosting activities, while secretly researching ways to break the faith-stability link.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Emergency Scatter Protocol
> Hidden in the deepest levels of the sanctuary is an emergency evacuation system called the Scatter Protocol, which can instantly transport all inhabitants to pre-selected safe locations throughout [[Aquabyssos. However, activating this system will permanently destroy the sanctuary and scatter the community forever, ending their unique experiment in cooperative living. The protocol requires three simultaneous activations by different Sanctuary Keepers, and only three people know of its existence. They are in deep disagreement about the circumstances that would justify using it - some believe it should be activated before overcrowding becomes critical, others argue it should only be used as an absolute last resort, and one believes it should never be used at all since it represents giving up on the community they've all worked to build.
