## Description
These perfectly-balanced tops are from the land of Amn, and made of brass, copper, and bronze. They are available in both solid and “singing” versions, the latter being ringed with holes such that they emit a sharp whistling while they spin. Order either type at 5 sp each, or get a mixed variety of 5 tops for 2 gp.
