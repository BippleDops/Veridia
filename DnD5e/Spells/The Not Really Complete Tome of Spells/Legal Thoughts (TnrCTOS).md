# Legal Thoughts (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
One target with an Intelligence of 5 or higher that you see within range is perma-nently compelled to follow one specific law prevalent in the area in which you and the target both currently reside. A creature immune to being charmed is unaffected by this spell.

Each time the creature attempts to break that law, it must make a Charisma saving throw in order to do so.

This does not place any moral restrictions on the target and only requires that it obey the letter of the law, so it is perfectly capable of thinking up and exploiting loopholes.
