# Hazirawn

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Greatsword, Melee Weapon, Martial Weapon

**Rarity:** legendary

**Attunement**: *requires attunement*

**Weight**: 6 lbs.

**Damage:** 2d6 slashing heavy, two-handed

## Description

A sentient (neutral evil) greatsword, Hazirawn is capable of speech in Common and Netherese. Even if you aren't attuned to the sword, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. If you are not attuned to Hazirawn, you deal an extra `dice: 1d6` necrotic damage when you hit with the weapon.

**Increased Potency.** While you are attuned to this weapon, its bonus on attack and damage rolls increases to +2, and a hit deals an extra `dice: 2d6` necrotic damage (instead of 1d6).

**Spells.** Hazirawn has 4 charges to cast spells. As long as the sword is attuned to you and you are holding it in your hand, you can cast [[Detect Magic (Ritual)|Detect Magic]] (1 charge), [[detect evil and good]] (1 charge), or [[detect thoughts]] (2 charges). Each night at midnight, Hazirawn regains `dice: 1d4` expended charges.

**Wounding.** While you are attuned to the weapon, any creature that you hit with Hazirawn can't regain hit points for 1 minute. The target can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect early on a success.

**Heavy.** Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively.

**Two-Handed.** This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
