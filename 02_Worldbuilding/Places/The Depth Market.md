# The Depth Market

*Where the Abyss Yields Its Treasures*

> *"Down here, in the crushing dark where pressure makes diamonds and cold preserves wonders, you can find anything - if you're willing to pay the price. Just remember: in the depths, everything costs more than money."*
> â€” [[12_Research/D&D_References/Master Trader Abyss Currentbinder]], Chief of the Depth Merchant's Consortium

## Overview

The Depth Market stands as [[12_Research/D&D_References/Aquabyssos]]'s most dangerous and exotic trading hub, a massive complex of interconnected chambers and tunnels carved into the walls of an abyssal trench where the deepest currents meet the ocean floor. Here, in the crushing depths where few dare to venture, merchants trade in the rarest and most valuable goods the deep ocean has to offer: abyssal crystals that glow with their own light, preserved specimens from creatures that have never seen sunlight, and artifacts recovered from ruins so ancient their builders are forgotten by history. The market operates under its own laws, independent of surface authority, where survival depends as much on cunning and courage as on coin.

## Secrets and Hidden Aspects

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Deep Pact
> The market's survival depends on a secret agreement with an ancient and powerful deep-sea entity known as the Depth Sovereign. [[12_Research/D&D_References/Master Trader Abyss Currentbinder]] personally negotiates this pact, which requires regular tribute of rare artifacts and magical items. The entity provides protection from the most dangerous abyssal creatures and favorable currents for trade routes, but the demands are becoming increasingly costly and dangerous. Breaking the pact would result in the market being destroyed by creatures and natural disasters.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Living Market
> The market complex itself is partially alive, grown rather than built using ancient biotechnology discovered in the ruins. The "walls" are actually a massive, slow-growing organism that responds to the needs of the inhabitants by creating new chambers and passages. Only a few of the oldest traders know this secret, and they've been carefully nurturing the growth while keeping it hidden. The organism requires specific nutrients and conditions to remain healthy, and its death would cause the entire market to collapse.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Pressure Addiction
> Long-term residence in the extreme deep-sea environment creates a form of physical and psychological addiction to the high pressure. Many permanent residents can no longer survive at normal pressures and become violently ill if they try to return to the surface. This condition is kept secret to avoid discouraging trade, but it's creating a growing population of people trapped in the depths. Some affected individuals are becoming increasingly desperate and may resort to extreme measures to either find a cure or ensure others share their fate.
