## Description
While [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Household Accoutrements/Candles|candles]] are a trusted source of illumination, they require holders. I carry candlesticks by the pair ranging from the fanciful to the sturdily utilitarian: carved wood, 4 sp; [[Lathe|lathe]]-turned brass, 6 sp; [[Lathe|lathe]]-turned copper, 8 sp; carved onyx, carnelian, or soapstone, 1 gp; [[Oven|kiln]]-glazed pottery, 3 sp; large wrought iron, 3 gp.
