- **Casting time:** 1 action

You attempt to charm a creature you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and it does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by you until the spell ends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed) creature is friendly to you. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by you.

**Classes**: Bard, Druid, Rogue (Arcane Trickster), Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
