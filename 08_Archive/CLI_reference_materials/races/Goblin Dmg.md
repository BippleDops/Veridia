# Goblin
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 282*  


- **Ability Scores**: str -2 dex +2
- **Size**: Small
- **Speed**: 30 ft.

## Traits

### Nimble Escape

You can take the [Disengage](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Disengage) or [Hide](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Hide) action as a bonus action on each of your turns.

### Darkvision

Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Common and Goblin.

## Player-Facing Summary

Goblin dmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of goblin dmg as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around goblin dmg.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties goblin dmg to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at goblin dmg to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to goblin dmg active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
