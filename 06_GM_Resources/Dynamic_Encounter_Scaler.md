# Dynamic Encounter Scaler

*Automatically adjust any encounter to challenge your party perfectly*

## Overview

The Dynamic Encounter Scaler transforms static encounters into perfectly balanced challenges regardless of party size, level, or composition. This tool uses mathematical scaling combined with narrative adjustments to maintain both mechanical balance and story coherence.

## Quick Scaling Formula

### Base Calculation
```
Adjusted CR = Base CR × (Party Size / 4) × (Party Level / Expected Level)
```

### Modifier Table
| Party Status | Multiplier | Narrative Justification |
|--------------|------------|-------------------------|
| Fresh & Rested | ×1.25 | Enemies are coordinated |
| Some Resources Used | ×1.0 | Standard encounter |
| Half Resources Gone | ×0.75 | Enemies are cautious |
| Nearly Depleted | ×0.5 | Enemies are overconfident |

## DM Notes

### Philosophy
Scaling isn't just mathematics—it's about maintaining dramatic tension while ensuring fun. A perfectly balanced encounter that's boring is worse than an unbalanced encounter that's memorable.

### Red Flags to Watch
- Players disengaging
- Constant character deaths
- No resource expenditure
- Analysis paralysis
- "Rocket tag" combat

### Golden Rules
1. **Fun > Balance**: Better to err on side of player enjoyment
2. **Narrative > Mechanics**: Story reasons for scaling feel better
3. **Variety > Consistency**: Mix easy and hard encounters
4. **Player Agency > DM Control**: Let players affect difficulty through choices
