# The Shadowmere

## Overview
A twilight realm where reality grows thin and shadows take on lives of their own. Once a verdant valley, the Shadowmere was transformed when the Shadow Shard crashed here during the Shattering, creating a persistent overlap between the Material Plane and the Shadowfell.

## Geography
The Shadowmere spans roughly 100 square miles of twisted landscape where normal laws of physics occasionally fail:

### The Umbral Forest
- Trees of living shadow that whisper secrets to those who listen
- Paths that change based on the walker's fears
- Shadow creatures that mimic travelers
- The Whispering Stones: ancient monuments that predate the Shattering

### Lake Gloom
- Waters of liquid shadow that reflect possibilities rather than reality
- The Drowned Village: submerged settlement visible only in shadow
- Islands that exist in different times simultaneously
- Hidden entrance to the Depth Gates (connecting to [[Aquabyssos]])

### The Grey Citadel
- Fortress of the Order of the Shattered Crown
- Built at the intersection of three ley lines
- Contains the Archive of Shadows (forbidden knowledge)
- Home to [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Sister Morwyn Veilkeeper]]'s sanctum

### The Fade Markets
- Traveling bazaar that appears at random
- Merchants from multiple planes
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]]'s secondary base of operations
- Trades in memories, dreams, and darker currencies

## Environmental Hazards
- **Shadow Sickness:** Prolonged exposure causes detachment from reality
- **Temporal Flux:** Time moves inconsistently (1 hour might equal 1 minute or 1 day)
- **Living Shadows:** Shadows occasionally detach and become hostile
- **Reality Tears:** Rifts to the Shadowfell open randomly

## Inhabitants

### Native Creatures
- Shadowkin (humanoids partially transformed by shadow)
- Umbral Stalkers (predators made of living darkness)
- Gloom Moths (feed on light and memory)
- Shadow Dragons (rare, incredibly dangerous)

### Factions Operating Here
- **Order of the Shattered Crown:** Maintains the Grey Citadel
- **The Whisper Syndicate:** Smuggling operations through shadow paths
- **Shadow Touched:** Communities of those corrupted but not consumed
- **The Veiled Accord:** Secret alliance between shadow entities

## Notable Locations

### The Anchor Stones
Three massive obsidian pillars that prevent the Shadowmere from expanding:
- Northern Anchor: Guarded by the Crystal Wardens
- Eastern Anchor: Protected by druidic wards
- Southern Anchor: Location known only to [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Sister Morwyn Veilkeeper]]

### The Threshold Inn
- Only safe haven for travelers
- Exists partially in multiple planes
- Proprietor: Madame Thresh (identity unknown)
- Neutral ground for all factions

### The Screaming Peaks
- Mountains where shadow and crystal corruption meet
- Source of shadow crystals (incredibly valuable, incredibly dangerous)
- Lair of the Shadow Dragon Nyxathid

## Resources & Trade
- Shadow Silk (weightless, magic-resistant fabric)
- Gloom Pearls (found in Lake Gloom, enhance divination)
- Temporal Crystals (allow limited time manipulation)
- Memory Shards (crystallized memories with various uses)

## Current Events
- Shadow corruption spreading despite the Anchor Stones
- Refugees from crystal corruption seeking sanctuary
- Strange signals from beneath Lake Gloom
- Increase in planar rifts near the Grey Citadel

## Secrets
> [!warning] DM Only
> - The Shadow Shard is actually sentient and manipulating events
> - Lake Gloom connects to flooded ruins of pre-Shattering Aquabyssos
> - The three Anchor Stones form a prison for an ancient shadow entity
> - The Drowned Village was the first settlement consumed by Aquabyssos floods
> - Removing the Shadow Shard would cause the entire region to shift into the Shadowfell
> - The Grey Citadel contains a portal to where the Crown of Stars originated
> - Time distortions are increasing, suggesting an approaching convergence

## Travel & Navigation
- Normal maps are useless; paths change based on intent
- Best traveled during twilight hours
- Requires guide or shadow-touched companion
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]]'s syndicate offers safe passage (for a price)

## Plot Hooks
1. Anchor Stone failing, needs rare components to repair
2. Shadow Dragon demanding tribute from nearby settlements
3. Merchants gone missing in the Fade Markets
4. Temporal anomalies revealing glimpses of the past/future
5. Lake Gloom producing prophecies of a "Great Drowning"

## Random Encounters (d12)
1-2: Shadow Merchants offering strange trades
3-4: Lost travelers from another time period
5-6: Umbral Stalker pack hunting
7-8: Reality tear opening nearby
9-10: Shadow-touched refugees seeking help
11: Manifestation of someone's nightmare
12: Agent of the Order testing visitors

## DM Notes
The Shadowmere serves as a hub for planar adventures and psychological horror elements. Its connection to both the Shadow Shard and the underwater realm of Aquabyssos makes it crucial for the overarching plot. The time distortions allow for creative storytelling, including glimpses of potential futures or echoes of the past. This region challenges players not just physically but mentally, as reality itself becomes unreliable.
