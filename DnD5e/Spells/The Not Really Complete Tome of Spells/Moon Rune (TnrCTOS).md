# Moon Rune (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *illusion*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (metallic ink)

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
You write up to seven nonmagical runes on any surface. This mark remains invisible until conditions you specify during the casting of this spell. The condition can be anything: a specific time of day or year, when moonlight (or light from a certain phase of the moon) illuminates the runes, or when the surface is touched by a member race, sex, or class, and so on.

The rune is permanent; when the condition goes away, so do the runes, but they reappear the next time the condition is met.

The runes can also be read by someone casting *see invisible* or *true seeing*.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can increase the number of runes you can write by seven for each spell slot above 2nd.
