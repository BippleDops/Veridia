  "prompt": "# TTRPG Asset Generation Prompt\n\n## Core Structure\n[Asset Type: handout]\n[Game System: D&D 5e]\n[Intended Use: VTT and Print reference]\n\n## Detailed Description\nSubject: In-world document â€” Merchant Contract with Fine Print\nEnvironment: creased parchment, water damage, ink bleed, readable serif fonts; clear headings; no gibberish\nStyle: heroic tabletop fantasy (D&D 5e adjacent), unified painterly collection style, grounded medieval-fantasy materials, culturally coherent gear, no modern tech or signage, high-res scan aesthetics\nTechnical Requirements: aspect 1:1, resolution 1024x1024\nPalette: teals, deep blues, sea-greens, pearl highlights\n\n\n## Visual Specifications\n- Lighting: studio\n- Detail Level: high detail for zoom, simplified for overview\n- Composition: rule of thirds with clear focal points and visual flow\n\n## Practical Considerations\n- Must be readable at intended viewing size\n- Text must be legible and non-gibberish. Favor simple, readable serif fonts, larger kerning, and clear headings. If uncertain, use short Latin-like placeholder words with proper spacing, or leave blank lines for later typesetting.\n- Avoid embedded text unless specified; prefer iconography and numbered pins\n\n## Negatives\n- nonsense text, watermarks, captions, signatures, artist names; modern signage, photoreal CGI, anime style, bloom glare; overly sexualized or glamorized portrayal\n\nThink deeply about creating an asset that enhances gameplay immersion while maintaining practical usability for TTRPG sessions.",
