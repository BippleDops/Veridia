# Deathmaster's Vial (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a vial filled with liq-uid from the boiled remains of a ghoul worth 50 gp).

**Duration**: 1 week


## Effects
You create an evil fluid and seal it in a specially prepared jar. The liquid will remain potent for 1 week, but will go bad within a hour of being directly exposed to sunlight or a spell that does radiant damage.

You may throw the vial at a target within 30 feet, using your spell attack modifier. On a hit, the vial shatters and the target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 6d6 necrotic damage and be paralyzed for 10 minutes on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage and be paralyzed for 1 minute on a successful one.
