# Trap #6 - "The Sand Gets In Your Eyes."
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> Once you have bested the door you enter a room 20 feet wide by 50 feet long by 10 feet tall. Like the entry room the walls are covered with frescos. In this room there is a slight difference, the coffin is missing and in the far left corner is a small stack of dust covered [[Sack (D&D 5e SRD)|sacks]]. The cloth is old and time worn so that some of the contents can be seen from [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]]. There is the fatal yellow glint of gold!
> 
> By now it should be clear to even the densest of your hapless victims that Evinrood " ... vants to be alone ... ", but the lure of gold is a powerful magnet for the average delver. Given time they will enter the room.
> 
> If the party enters the room in a mass without taking precautions, by the time they reach a point 40 feet from the door they will activate a rocker panel in the floor that will cause the door to ctose. (The rocker panel is a slab 5 feet wide that stretches across the tomb from one wall to the other. It is balanced on a simple 1/8 th. of an inch "ridge" in the floor running the width of the room. When stepped on this switch will descend with an audible "click" to the side the delver has stepped on and thus activate whatever device is describedô€ƒ– in this case a door closer, and a locking device.)
> 
> There will be a moment of tension as the party braces for the worst. You can even expect some frantic efforts to reopen the door. Let them try: the finger holes on this side will be in a different ord.er than on the opposite side of the door, and if they rush they could do themselves a great disservice. What they will find in the end is that the door will reopen easily, but every time someone steps on the rocker panel the door will close and lock again. They may give up in frustration, or they may leave something or someone blocking the door. In any event there is little else that will happen dealing with the door. This is all a ruse to lull the party into [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|falling]] into the actual trap!
> 
> Upon close inspection the bags will be exactly what they seem. Old, time decayed canvas bags, leaking fine piles of gold dust from a number of burst seams. There are no obvious strings attached, the bags will be sitting there free for the taking. There is no magic on the bags.
> 
> With even the most cautious bunch someone will eventually attempt to move the bags. It is at this point that the fun begins. First the tripping mechanism is operated by the lifting of even one of the bags. They are resting on a pressure plate, the weight of even one of them being removed will cause the panel in the center of the room to open.
> 
> From the center of the ceiling will drop an [[Elemental, Air (D&D 5e SRD)|Air Elemental]]. Along with the [[14 - Monsters (D&D 5e SRD)|elemental]] this panel will release a room full of sand which is also stored in the chamber above. This chamber is 20 feet wide, by 20 feet deep, and 35 feet in height. The [[14 - Monsters (D&D 5e SRD)|elemental]] has been entombed there for centuries, and is measurably upset. It will [[14 - Actions in Combat (D&D 5e SRD)|attack]] the party in the only fashion open to it. By swirling the sand that is [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|falling]], and coincidentally the gold dust from the relatively fragile bags, into their faces, and against exposed skin surfaces. This [[14 - Actions in Combat (D&D 5e SRD)|attack]] will have little but nuisance value and is no real threat to the delvers, but you don't have to tell them that They will attempt to counter [[14 - Actions in Combat (D&D 5e SRD)|attack]] but unless they have enchanted [[3 - Weapons (D&D 5e SRD)|weapons]] or [[14 - Actions in Combat (D&D 5e SRD)|attack]] with magic spells they will have little effect (Magically the [[14 - Monsters (D&D 5e SRD)|elemental]] is fairly fonnidable and should not be dismissed by a simple spell or low level dispersal. The object being to divert even a powerful [[Wizard (D&D 5e SRD)|wizard]] for a few moments.)
> 
> The chief purpose of the [[14 - Monsters (D&D 5e SRD)|elemental]] is to disburse the gold dust all about the room, and primarily to blind the party with a mini-sandstorm, while the room fills with sand!
> 
> I rate this room at only two skulls, because it is not primarily lethal (unless some delving ditz happens to be standing under the panel when it opens and gets several tons of sand on his head!) The party can ignore the [[14 - Monsters (D&D 5e SRD)|elemental]] and make a break for the exit across the room, but [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] door should be blocked with piled sand in a very short time. The delvers may be able to thrash their way through the sand heap but only with considerable hard labor, a word that is seldom used to describe the goals of the average delver.
> 
> They also could rightly conclude that there is an exit in this comer and actively seek it. There is a door behind the stucco in this comer, (see map) with the ever present finger trap. This door can be found by revelation magic, or actively chipping at the stucco. (If you are one of these weak-kneed dungeon masters, who is averse to weeding out the weak and feeble among the delving parties, you could have some of the stucco flaked off over time, "revealing" the exit to even the densest of delvers.)
> 
> In any event the party will almost certainly have lost the gold dust. If they go back into [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] chamber, return to the options there. If they press on then they will find themselves in the clutches of the next trap.
