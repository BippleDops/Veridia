## Curse

This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when the [[identify-xphb (spells)]] spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by a [[Remove Curse Xphb]] spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have [[Vulnerability Xphb]] to Bludgeoning and Piercing damage.
