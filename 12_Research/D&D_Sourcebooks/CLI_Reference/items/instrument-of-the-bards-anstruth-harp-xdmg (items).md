# Instrument of the Bards, Anstruth Harp
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/anstruth-harp.webp#right)

An Instrument of the Bards is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `2d4` Psychic damage.

You can play Anstruth Harp to cast one of the following spells: [[fly xphb|Fly]], [[invisibility xphb|Invisibility]], [[levitate xphb|Levitate]], [[protection from evil and good xphb|Protection from Evil and Good]], [[cure wounds xphb|Cure Wounds]] (level 5), [[ice storm xphb|Ice Storm]], and [[wall of thorns xphb|Wall of Thorns]]. Once the Anstruth Harp has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
