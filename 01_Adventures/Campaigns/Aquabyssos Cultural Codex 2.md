## Player-Facing Summary

The Aquabyssos Cultural Codex provides comprehensive guidance for understanding and navigating the complex social customs of underwater civilization. These traditions affect every aspect of daily life, from simple greetings to major life events, and understanding them is essential for successful interaction with Aquabyssos society.

## Lore Details

The cultural traditions of Aquabyssos have evolved over millennia in response to the unique challenges of underwater life. Each custom serves both practical and symbolic purposes, helping to maintain social cohesion while addressing the physical realities of life in the depths. Many traditions can be traced back to ancient survival necessities that have become ritualized over generations.

## Adventure Hooks

## DM Notes

Use the cultural customs as a framework for creating realistic social interactions and consequences. Players who learn and respect the customs will find doors opening and allies supporting them, while those who ignore or violate traditions may face social ostracism or worse. Consider how different NPCs might react to cultural violations based on their own background and position in society.

The depth-based hierarchy provides natural tension and conflict opportunities, while the various ceremonies and festivals offer chances for both celebration and disruption. Remember that these customs are living traditions that may be evolving in response to current events in your campaign.
