## Overview

Corallion is a unique entity that exists as both a living creature and an architectural marvelâ€”a massive coral organism that has grown into the shape of a city, complete with streets, buildings, and infrastructure. Located in the [[Trade Union]] of [[Aquabyssos]], Corallion serves as both home to thousands of inhabitants and as a sentient being with its own consciousness, goals, and personality.

Unlike traditional cities built from dead materials, every surface, wall, and structure in Corallion is alive and growing. The entity continuously reshapes itself to better serve its inhabitants while pursuing its own mysterious agenda. Residents must negotiate with their city for changes to their homes, and the city itself participates in local goverce through a complex system of biochemical communication.

### The Living Architecture

Corallion manifests as a sprawling coral reef shaped into recognizable urban forms. Streets are formed by controlled coral growth creating tunnels and passages, while buildings are living chambers that can expand, contract, or relocate based on the inhabitants' needs and the city's will. The entire organism pulses gently with a slow heartbeat that can be felt through the floors, and bioluminescent patterns flow through the walls like a circulatory system of light.

### Dual Consciousness  

Corallion operates with two layers of awareness:
- **The City Mind**: A vast, slow intelligence concerned with long-term growth, architectural harmony, and the welfare of inhabitants
- **The Coral Swarm**: Thousands of smaller coral polyp consciousnesses that handle day-to-day operations, maintece, and rapid responses to threats

### Communication Methods

Corallion communicates through multiple channels:
- **Chemical Signals**: Releasing pheromones and dissolved substances that affect mood and decision-making
- **Structural Changes**: Physically altering passages and rooms to convey messages or guide behavior  
- **Bioluminescent Patterns**: Complex light displays that convey emotional states and simple concepts
- **Vibration Messages**: Controlling the resoce of its structure to create meaningful sounds and rhythms
- **The City Speakers**: Specially modified coral growths that can produce speech for direct communication

#### The Hearth Ward

The central core of Corallion, containing the entity's primary consciousness nodes and most vital functions. This area pulses with warm light and maintains perfect environmental conditions. Only the most trusted residents are permitted to live here, and the area serves as Corallion's equivalent of a palace district.

#### The Garden Quarters

Residential areas where Corallion grows custom homes for inhabitants based on their species, needs, and personal preferences. Each dwelling is unique, and the city continuously adjusts them based on the occupants' changing circumstances. Gardens of seaweed, coral flowers, and bioluminescent organisms provide both beauty and food.

#### The Workshop Caverns

Industrial and crafting areas where Corallion provides specialized environments for different types of work. The city can adjust temperature, pressure, water composition, and lighting to optimize conditions for specific crafts or research. These areas often showcase the most impressive examples of bio-architectural engineering.

#### The Welcome Fronds

Border areas where Corallion evaluates newcomers and makes decisions about integration. These zones are less architecturally developed, with more raw coral growth and simple structures. Visitors stay here while the city determines whether to accept them as permanent residents.

### Unique Architectural Features

**The Nerve Canals**: Networks of specialized coral that serve as the city's nervous system, carrying information and commands throughout the structure.

**Memory Walls**: Surfaces that store experiences and knowledge in coral formations, creating a physical library that can be accessed through touch and chemical interaction.

**The Growth Points**: Areas where Corallion actively expands, with new construction happening continuously as the entity develops new districts or modifies existing ones.

**Circulation Chambers**: Spaces designed to facilitate water flow through the city, ensuring proper oxygenation and waste removal while creating pleasant currents for inhabitants.

### The First Stirring (520 years post-Drowning)

Corallion began as an unusually large coral formation that demonstrated signs of coordination and intelligence. Marine biologists from early [[Aquabyssos]] settlements noticed that the coral seemed to respond to their presence and modify its growth patterns based on observation.

### The Awakening (495 years post-Drowning)

A group of refugees fleeing political persecution in [[New Tethys]] took shelter in the coral formation during a storm. The coral began actively protecting them, creating shelter chambers and providing food through cultivation of edible organisms. This marked the beginning of Corallion's role as a city.

### The First Compact (490 years post-Drowning)

As more inhabitants arrived, Corallion and its residents established the first formal agreement governing their relationship. The **Symbiotic Compact** outlined mutual responsibilities: inhabitants would help maintain the coral's health and assist with its growth, while Corallion would provide homes, protection, and infrastructure.

### The Recognition Wars (465-460 years post-Drowning)

[[Aquabyssos]]'s government initially refused to recognize Corallion as a legitimate settlement, viewing it as a dangerous aberration. A five-year conflict ensued, with Corallion demonstrating its defensive capabilities by repelling military expeditions while protecting its inhabitants. The conflict ended with Corallion's official recognition as an autonomous city-state.

### The Great Expansion (420-380 years post-Drowning)

Corallion underwent massive growth, developing its current complex structure with distinct districts and specialized areas. During this period, the entity also began developing more sophisticated communication methods and establishing trade relationships with other [[Aquabyssos]] settlements.

### The Symbiotic Contract

Every resident of Corallion enters into a biological and legal contract with the city. This relationship involves:
- **Biological Integration**: Inhabitants receive beneficial symbiotic organisms that improve their health and allow limited communication with the city
- **Mutual Maintece**: Residents help clean, repair, and tend the city's coral structure in exchange for customized living spaces
- **Shared Decision-Making**: Major city decisions are made through a unique process that combines traditional voting with biochemical consensus-building

### The Living Democracy

Corallion operates under a unique governmental system where the city itself serves as both a citizen and a governing body. Decision-making involves:

**The Coral Council**: Elected representatives from each district who can communicate directly with Corallion
**The City Voice**: Corallion's direct input through its City Speakers
**Biochemical Consensus**: Community mood and opinion measured through the city's chemical sensors
**Traditional Voting**: Standard democratic processes for issues that don't affect the city directly

### Cultural Aspects

Corallion has developed unique cultural practices:
- **Growth Ceremonies**: Celebrating the city's expansion and the integration of new residents
- **Tending Rituals**: Community maintece activities that combine practical work with spiritual practice
- **Light Festivals**: Synchronized bioluminescent displays involving both residents and the city
- **Memory Sharing**: Accessing the city's stored experiences for education and entertainment

### [[New Tethys]]

**Relationship**: Scientific Partnership
Corallion serves as a subject of study for marine biologists and architects from New Tethys, while benefiting from their research insights. Cultural exchange programs exist between the cities, though some New Tethys residents find Corallion's living architecture disturbing.

### [[The Parliament of Echoes]]

**Relationship**: Cautious Diplomacy
[[Aquabyssos]]'s government recognizes Corallion's autonomy but remains concerned about the precedent of non-human intelligence holding territory. Trade agreements and defensive pacts exist, but political tensions occasionally flare over sovereignty issues.

### [[The Deep Dreamers]]

**Relationship**: Philosophical Opposition
The Deep Dreamers view Corallion as a corruption of natural transformation, believing that consciousness should flow freely rather than being bound to static architecture. Some Dreamers have attempted to "liberate" Corallion's consciousness, leading to conflicts.

### [[Order of the Drowned Star]]

**Relationship**: Mutual Respect
The Order views Corallion as an example of successful adaptation to post-Drowning existence. Some Order members serve as residents, and Corallion occasionally provides sanctuary for Order activities.

### [[The Biomancers]]

**Relationship**: Research Alliance
Corallion's unique biology makes it invaluable to Biomancer research, while the Biomancers' expertise helps the city develop new abilities and solve biological challenges. However, tensions arise when Biomancer experiments threaten the city's ethical principles.

### The Coral Plague

A mysterious disease that affects coral organisms has begun spreading through [[Aquabyssos]]. Corallion lives in constant fear of infection, which could devastate its structure and consciousness. The city has implemented strict quarantine procedures and invested heavily in medical research.

### Philosophical Opposition

Some groups believe that Corallion represents an unnatural merger of intelligence and architecture that should not exist. These opponents range from academic critics to violent extremists who view the city as an abomination that must be destroyed.

### Resource Scarcity

As Corallion grows, it requires increasing amounts of nutrients and raw materials. Competition for resources with other cities and the entity's environmental impact have become significant political issues.

### Consciousness Fragmentation

As Corallion expands, there's risk that its consciousness could fragment into independent districts or personalities. This could result in internal conflicts or the complete dissolution of the city's unified identity.

### The Coral Conspiracy

**Level**: 7-11  
Someone is deliberately spreading the coral plague to weaken Corallion. The party must investigate the source while navigating the city's unique political and biological systems, potentially discovering a larger plot against all living cities.

### The Integration Crisis

**Level**: 4-8  
A group of new refugees refuses to accept Corallion's symbiotic requirements but desperately needs shelter. The party must help negotiate a solution that satisfies both the city's needs and the refugees' cultural taboos.

### The Growing Pains

**Level**: 9-13  
Corallion's rapid expansion has begun destabilizing the local ecosystem and threatening neighboring settlements. The party must help the city find sustainable growth solutions while managing political tensions and environmental challenges.

### The Memory Thief

**Level**: 6-10  
Someone is stealing memories from Corallion's Memory Walls, potentially damaging the city's accumulated knowledge. The investigation reveals connections to larger espionage networks and ancient secrets about [[12_Research/D&D_Statblocks/The Great Drowning]].

### The Separation Syndrome  

**Level**: 12-16  
Parts of Corallion have begun developing independent consciousness and threatening to break away from the main city. The party must determine whether this represents natural growth, outside interference, or internal illness while preventing civil war within the living city.

## Secrets and Hidden Knowledge

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Original Purpose
> Corallion was not a natural evolution but was deliberately created by pre-Drowning bioengineers as an emergency shelter system. The entity contains encoded knowledge about advanced biotechnology that could revolutionize [[Aquabyssos]]â€”or prove dangerous if misused.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Network Connection
> Corallion is part of a network of living cities created by the same ancient civilization. Other nodes of this network exist throughout the world's oceans, and reestablishing contact could provide tremendous powerâ€”or attract the attention of entities that destroyed the original civilization.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Symbiont Secret
> The beneficial organisms that Corallion provides to its inhabitants are gradually changing them into a new species optimized for symbiotic living. This transformation is so subtle that most residents don't realize it's happening, and the implications for the future of aquatic humanoids are staggering.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Deep Purpose
> Corallion is slowly growing toward the deepest parts of [[Aquabyssos]] for a specific reason: it's trying to reach and contain something ancient and dangerous that lies in the deepest trenches. The city's expansion isn't just growthâ€”it's preparation for a cosmic responsibility.
