## Description
Weredactyls in their “human” form are fat, slouching humanoids with protruding faces, low foreheads, and sagittal crests. Their wereform is a pterodactyl with long human fingers at the wing-joint and human eyes. In hybrid form, their arms and legs are more developed, and their wings and beaks are small; too small to enable flight, in the case of the wings.

Weredactyls live in servitude to the evil [[Skelzi|skelzis]]. They are naturally stupid even in human form. Weredactyls without skelzis to command them have been known to throw all their axes at approaching enemies, leaving themselves weaponless in the following melee. If they spend more than six continuous hours in pterodactyl form, they go completely feral and must be retrained from scratch to be of any use to their [[Skelzi|skelzi]] masters. Obviously, the skelzis go to great lengths to prevent this from happening— just one reason why weredactyls are almost never encountered without skelzis nearby.

All but a few of the many skelzi hegemonies and empires use weredactyls as aerial mounts. They are most useful only in astral, ethereal, and other extraplanar environments, however, because in those planes, a weredactyl can carry a skelzi rider aloft. In the Material Plane, a weredactyl can fly with a Small rider, but it isn’t strong enough to carry a Medium rider in flight. *Enlarge/reduce potions* are highly valued by skelzis visiting the Material Plane, because they can use the potions to become small enough for their weredactyl mounts to carry them, then return to normal size at the conclusion of their journey.
