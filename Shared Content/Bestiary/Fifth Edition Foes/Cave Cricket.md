## Special Traits
**Chirp:** Creatures within 20 feet of a chirping cave cricket can't be heard unless they scream. Spellcasters in the area must make a successful DC 9 Constitution saving throw to cast a spell correctly. Failure indicates the spell is not cast, but the slot is not expended. The chirping doubles the chance of attracting wandering monsters, if applicable.

## Description
Cave crickets are larger versions of normal crickets and, like the smaller crickets they resemble, they are mostly harmless. Their chief danger comes from their chirping, which they do when alarmed, because other monsters recognize that sound as indicating there might be fresh prey nearby. The chirping travels up to 300 feet through the tunnels and caves where these crickets are normally found.

Cave crickets are about 3 feet long.

These giant insects rarely attack living creatures larger than themselves. If attacked, a cave cricket uses its powerful legs to kick opponents before hopping away.

## Additional Details
**Credit**: The cave cricket originally appeared in the First Edition module S4 The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth (© TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1982) and later in the First Edition Monster Manual II (© TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1983), and is used by permission.
