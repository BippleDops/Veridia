--- > [!figure] Portrait ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Description

A stocky dwarf standing 4'2" with a magnificent braided beard adorned with small iron rings. His arms are thick with muscle from years at the forge, and his leather apron bears the burns and stains of countless hours of work. ## Background

Gareth arrived at the Market District fifteen years ago after his clan's mountain hold was overrun by orcs. He established the finest smithy in the region and has become a pillar of the merchant community. ## Player-Facing Summary Gareth Ironforge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Gareth Ironforge as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Gareth Ironforge. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A stranger needs help finding before the new moon
