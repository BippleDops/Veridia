By understanding these secrets, the Druids of this circle seek to harness the powers of the cosmos. ### Star Map (Level 3) You've created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a [[spellcasting-focus-xphb (variant-rules) for your Druid spells. You determine its form by rolling on the Star Map table or by choosing one. While holding the map, you have the [guidance-xphb (spells)]] and [[Guiding Bolt Xphb spells prepared, and you can cast [Guiding Bolt Xphb]] without expending a spell slot. You can cast it in that way a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long-rest-xphb. If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement. This ceremony can be performed during a [short-rest-xphb]] or [[long-rest-xphb]], and it destroys the previous map. **Star Map**`dice: [](druid-xphb-circle-of-the-stars-xphb.md#^star-map)`| dice: `dice: 1d6` | Map Form |

^star-map ### Starry Form (Level 3) As a [[Action Xphb, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form rather than shape-shifting. While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous, your joints glimmer like stars, and glowing lines connect them as on a star chart. This form sheds [Light Xphb]] in a 10-foot radius and [[Light Xphb for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), have the [conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] condition, or use this feature again. Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which of the following constellations glimmers on your body; your choice gives you certain benefits while in the form. ### Archer (Level 3) A constellation of an archer appears on you. When you activate this form and as a [[Action Xphb on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of yourself. On a hit, the attack deals Radiant damage equal to`d8`plus your Wisdom modifier. ### Chalice (Level 3) A constellation of a life-giving goblet appears on you. Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores [hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules) equal to`d8`plus your Wisdom modifier. ### Dragon (Level 3) A constellation of a wise dragon appears on you. When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain [conditions#Concentration|Concentration]], you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the`d20`as a 10. ### Cosmic Omen (Level 6) Whenever you finish a [[long-rest-xphb, you can consult your Star Map for omens and roll a die. Until you finish your next [long-rest-xphb]], you gain access to a special [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules) based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number on the die: - **Weal (even).** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a [d20-test-xphb (variant-rules)]], you can take a [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules) to roll`d6`and add the number rolled to the total. - **Woe (odd).** Whenever a creature you can see within 30 feet of you is about to make a [d20-test-xphb (variant-rules)]], you can take a [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules) to roll`d6`and subtract the number rolled from the total. You can use this [reaction-xphb (variant-rules)]] a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[long-rest-xphb. ### Twinkling Constellations (Level 10) The constellations of your Starry Form improve. The`d8`of the Archer and the Chalice becomes``dice: 2d8``, and while the Dragon is active, you have a [Fly Speed Xphb]] of 20 feet and can hover. Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while in your Starry Form, you can change which constellation glimmers on your body. ### Full of Stars (Level 14) While in your Starry Form, you become partially incorporeal, giving you [[boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats)]] to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Druid xphb circle of the stars xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
