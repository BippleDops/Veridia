*Scroll, legendary* When you take a [[actions#Magic|Magic action to read this scroll, a [Colossus Xmm]] appears in an unoccupied space on the ground or in water that you can see within 1 mile of yourself. The [[Colossus Xmm is [Hostile Attitude Xphb]] toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules). If the [Colossus Xmm]] is summoned into a space that isn't large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 303* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Scroll of titan summoning colossus xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
