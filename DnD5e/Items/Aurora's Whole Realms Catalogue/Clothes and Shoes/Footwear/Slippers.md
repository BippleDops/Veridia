## Description
Our slippers are always warm and comfortable, and perfect for those cold nights in front of the hearth. Theyâ€™re lightweight, so you can take them anywhere, yet they are durable enough to last. Made of quilted linen (15 sp), quilted silk (35 gp) or wool (10 sp), we have them in navy, maroon, brown, and black.
