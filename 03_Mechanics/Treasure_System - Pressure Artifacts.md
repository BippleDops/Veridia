# Pressure Artifacts
*Magical Items Forged in the Depths of Aquabyssos*

## Overview
Pressure Artifacts are magical items uniquely attuned to the crushing depths and tidal forces of Aquabyssos. These items harness the immense pressure of the deep ocean, drawing power from the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]] to create effects impossible to replicate on the surface. Many Pressure Artifacts require attunement and function best at depth, losing effectiveness or even becoming dormant when brought to shallow waters or dry land.
