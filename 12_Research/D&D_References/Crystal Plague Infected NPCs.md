## Overview

The Crystal Plague affects individuals differently based on their background, personality, physical condition, and circumstances of infection. These NPC profiles demonstrate the human stories behind the disease statistics, providing DMs with ready-to-use characters that illustrate different aspects of the plague crisis.

### Marina Tidwell - The Devoted Mother

**Age:** 34  
**Occupation:** Former dock worker, currently unemployed  
**Stage:** 1 (infected 6 days ago)  
**Location:** [[Crystal Plague Wards]], Room 203  
**Family:** Son Thomas (8, Stage 1), Husband Willem (uninfected, working double shifts to pay for treatment)

#### Physical Description
Marina's crystalline patches follow the geometric patterns of dock rope braiding - parallel lines that intersect at precise angles along her forearms and shoulders. The crystals shimmer with faint blue-green hues that match the harbor water she worked around for fifteen years.

#### Personality and Motivations
- **Primary Concern:** Protecting her son from the worst aspects of their situation
- **Coping Mechanism:** Creates elaborate stories about their crystals being "special gifts" from sea spirits
- **Hidden Fear:** That she infected Thomas through maternal contact
- **Daily Routine:** Sketches impossible ship designs that seem to move on their own

*Character Quote:* "The crystals show me ships that could sail between stars. I know it's the plague talking, but the designs are so beautiful. Maybe this is why it happened - so I could see things normal people can't."

### Captain James Stormwind - The Retired Sailor

**Age:** 67  
**Occupation:** Retired naval captain  
**Stage:** 1 (infected 12 days ago, progression unusually slow)  
**Location:** [[Crystal Plague Wards|Quarantine Barge]] "Mercy's Grace"  
**Background:** Decorated veteran of three naval wars, infected during "one last voyage"

#### Physical Description
Crystalline formations follow his old nautical tattoos - stars, anchors, and compass roses outlined in pale blue crystal. His weathered hands show crystal growth along scars from old rope burns and sword cuts.

#### Personality and Motivations  
- **Leadership Style:** Takes charge of barge community activities and maintains morale
- **Philosophy:** Views plague as "just another storm to weather"
- **Knowledge Base:** Extensive maritime experience valuable to medical staff studying infection patterns
- **Daily Activities:** Organizes patient activities, tells stories, maintains nautical traditions

*Character Quote:* "I've sailed every sea from here to the Crystal Straits. Never thought I'd end my career as cargo on a plague ship. At least the view's still good, and these young folks need someone to keep their spirits up."

### Sarah Brightcoral - The Prodigious Child

**Age:** 10  
**Occupation:** Student (when not hospitalized)  
**Stage:** 1 (infected 8 days ago)  
**Location:** [[Crystal Plague Wards]] Children's Ward  
**Special Ability:** Crystal growths form functional musical instruments

#### Physical Description
Sarah's crystalline formations create delicate, chime-like structures along her fingers and around her throat. When she speaks or moves, these crystals produce soft musical tones that vary with her emotional state.

#### Personality and Motivations
- **Artistic Nature:** Uses her condition to create beautiful music for other patients
- **Innocence:** Doesn't fully understand the severity of her situation
- **Leadership:** Other children gather around her for "crystal concerts" and stories

### Relationship Dynamics
These NPCs are designed to interact with each other and with player characters in complex ways. Their different stages of transformation create natural tension and opportunities for character development.

### Progression Over Time
NPCs can advance through plague stages during campaign play, creating ongoing character arcs and emotional investment from players. Some may be saved through player intervention while others choose to embrace transformation.

### Moral Complexity
Each NPC represents different aspects of the plague crisis - victim, researcher, spiritual seeker, conspiracy theorist, and transcended being. Players must navigate relationships without simple "good vs. evil" judgments.

### Information Networks
These NPCs form interconnected networks that span all aspects of plague society - medical, religious, criminal, academic, and governmental. Players can access different information and opportunities through relationship building.

### Personal Stakes
Use these NPCs to create personal connections for player characters. Family members, friends, mentors, or rivals dealing with plague create emotional investment in the storyline.

### Information Sources
Different NPCs provide access to different types of information - medical knowledge, cult theology, government secrets, criminal opportunities, and transcendent wisdom.

### Moral Dilemmas  
Present situations where helping one NPC may harm another, or where the "right" choice is unclear. Use NPC relationships to explore themes of sacrifice, acceptance, and change.

### Character Development
Allow player characters to influence NPC outcomes through their choices and actions. Some NPCs can be saved, others guided toward positive transformation, and some may serve as cautionary tales.
