# The Seven Shards
*Fragments of Godhood Scattered Across the World*

## Overview
When the Crown of Stars shattered during [[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/Lore/The Great Crystallization]], it broke into seven primary fragments, each containing a portion of Aetheron's divine essence. These Shards are the most powerful artifacts in [[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/Locations/Aethermoor]], capable of granting godlike power or bringing about the world's destruction.

## The Nature of Shards

### Divine Properties
- Contain fragments of Aetheron's consciousness
- Grant divine-level magical abilities
- Corrupt mortals who wield them
- Seek reunification with each other
- Alter reality in their vicinity

### Physical Properties
- Indestructible by mortal means
- Size of a human fist
- Glow with inner light
- Resonate when near each other
- Transform surroundings slowly

### The Convergence
> [!warning] DM Only
> When all seven gather in one place:
> 1. Reality tears open
> 2. Divine realm merges with material
> 3. Bearer must choose: Destroy, Reform, or Become
> 4. Choice determines world's fate

## Historical Attempts

### Past Seekers
- **The First Emperor** (300 years ago): Found three, went mad
- **The Crystal Prophets** (150 years ago): Religious cult, destroyed
- **The Merchant Kings** (75 years ago): Economic manipulation, failed
- **Current**: Multiple factions racing

## Methods of Control

### Containing a Shard
- Divine wards (temporary)
- Opposing Shard negation
- Willing sacrifice of bearer
- Planar imprisonment
- Crystal resonance chambers

### Destroying a Shard
> [!warning] DM Only - Possible Methods
> - Unite all seven, then choose destruction
> - Divine intervention (true god)
> - Sacrifice of equal divine essence
> - Return to origin point during eclipse
> - Unknown cost to reality itself

## DM Secrets
> [!warning] Ultimate Truth
> The Shards aren't just fragments—they're Aetheron's attempt to experience mortality through division. Each represents an aspect of divinity experiencing mortal existence. The Golden Shard in Aria is his heart, experiencing innocence and growth. Reunification means choosing between godhood's power and mortality's meaning.
