A virulent shadow corruption is spreading through Aquabyssos, causing victims to slowly fade into incorporeal darkness. Traditional healing fails against this supernatural affliction. The quest involves researching ancient texts, gathering rare components, and confronting the corruption's source to develop a cure. ## Quest Giver

3. **Alchemical Analysis** - Breaking down the corruption's magical signature
4. **Victim Interviews** - Learning from those still coherent
5. **Religious Consultation** - Divine insights into darkness/light balance ## The Source
