# Conjure Minor Elementals
*4th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You conjure spirits from the Elemental Planes that flit around you in a 15-foot [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] for the duration. Until the spell ends, any attack you make deals an extra `2d8` damage when you hit a creature in the [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]]. This damage is Acid, Cold, Fire, or Lightning (your choice when you make the attack).

In addition, the ground in the [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] is [[difficult-terrain-xphb|Difficult Terrain]] for your enemies.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d8` for each spell slot level above 4.

**Classes**: [[list-spells-classes-druid|Druid]]; [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Fighter (Eldritch Knight)]]; [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]; [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Rogue (Arcane Trickster)]]; [[list-spells-classes-wizard|Wizard]]
