# Webs
*Generic Hazard*  

Giant spiders weave thick, sticky webs across passages and at the bottom of pits to snare prey. These web-filled areas are [[difficult-terrain-xphb|Difficult Terrain]].

A creature that enters a web-filled area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or have the [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition. As an action, a creature Restrained by the webs can try to escape from them, doing so with a successful DC 12 Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) or Dexterity ([[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]) check.

Each 10-foot [[cube-area-of-effect-xphb|Cube]] of webs has AC 10; HP 15; Vulnerability to Fire damage; and Immunity to Piercing, Poison, and Psychic damage.
