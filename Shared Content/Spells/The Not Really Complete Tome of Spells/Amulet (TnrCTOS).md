# Amulet (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 hour

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (any object worth at least 5 gp and a relic of the creature to be affected)

**Duration**: 1 month


## Effects
You create a token that repels one specific creature that is feared by many. You must provide either the creature’s name or a de-scription of the creature (such as “the vam-pire Ebon Thuthane” or “the giant one-eyed boar that destroyed hamlet of Marswick”). When the person who wears the token con-fronts this creature in melee combat, it must make an Intelligence saving throw or be at disadvantage on attack rolls against the wearer.
