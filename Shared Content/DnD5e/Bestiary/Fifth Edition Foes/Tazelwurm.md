## Special Traits
**Ambush:** A tazelwurm has tactical advantage on initiative rolls. Against an opponent that hasnt yet taken a turn in the current combat, the tazelwurm has tactical advantage on attack rolls and each of its attacks causes an additional 3 (`dice: 1d6`) damage.

**Frightening Exuviation:** If an attack that hits a tazelwurm includes fire damage, the tazelwurm takes no damage. Instead, its skin, scales, and flesh burn away in just a few seconds, reducing the tazelwurm to a living skeleton. A creature viewing this (other than another tazelwurm) must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for `dice: 1d4` rounds. A creature that saves successfully cant be affected by this ability until after its next long rest. If the tazelwurm survives the encounter, it regenerates all of its flesh and organs in 24 hours.

**Claws:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d6+2`) slashing damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any mountains

**Organization**: Solitary or pair

## Description
A tazelwurm is an aggressive, flesh-eating monster with a serpentine body, a feline head, and two long, powerful arms equipped with razorsharp claws. Their flesh has the mottled appearance of stone and gravel, giving them excellent camouflage. They haunt mountain passes and prey on travelers passing through their territory.

Tazelwurms are masters of camouflage. Very old tazelwurms sometimes have lichens and mosses growing on them, enhancing their rocky appearance. They plan elaborate ambushes to gain devastating first strikes against intruders. They are diurnal hunters and are most active in the morning hours. Their hunting grounds cover several square miles of rocky terrain. Should a tazelwurm be detected in another’s territory, it is quickly driven away. Tazelwurms eat just about anything, but they are especially fond of mountain lions and mountain goats. Downed prey is dragged to the tazelwurm’s lair, which is usually a well-hidden and nearly inaccessible depression or cave. The kill is devoured over a period of several days.

Tazelwurms rarely interact with other creatures, including their own kind. When more than one is encountered, they will be a mated pair. Young are born live and left to the care of the mother. Young tazelwurms reach maturity and are driven out of their parents’ territory after two years.

After choosing a likely ambush spot, a tazelwurm conceals itself among stones and scree along a path or a game trail, then waits for a meal to pass by. Being lone hunters, tazelwurms generally ignore large groups; they prefer to attack lone travelers, a single straggler from a large group, or a one-or-two-member scouting party moving ahead of a larger body. A hungry or desperate tazelwurm will attack just about anything, however.
