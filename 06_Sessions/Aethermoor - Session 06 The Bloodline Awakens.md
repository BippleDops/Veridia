--- # Session 6: [The Bloodline]] Awakens > *One party member begins to crystallize, but unlike plague victims, the crystals form protective patterns.* ## 🔧 [[Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### [Connection Improvements]] - Add cross-references to related notes ### [[Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## 🎬 [Strong Start]] One party member begins to crystallize, but unlike plague victims, the crystals form protective patterns. Ancient memories flood their mind - they see [[Aquabyssos in its glory, and their ancestor helping to create the [Seven Shards]] prison. [[[The Crimson Sage]] arrives: "We have 24 hours. Your awakening has accelerated everything." ## 🔍 Secrets & Clues 1. [[The Seventh Shard isn't an object - it's a living bloodline

2. [The Drowned]] God was actually Aquabyssos's magical defense system
3. The plague transformation would make humans compatible with Aquabyssos
4. [[[The Crimson Sage]] has been weakening the prison to prevent catastrophic release
5. [[Marina-Red-Tide-Coralheart's organization has been protecting bloodline descendants
6. [[[High Inquisitor]] Maltheos]]'s son is another bloodline carrier
7. The festival ground was chosen because it's directly above Aquabyssos
8. The original ritual can be inverted to seal the city permanently
9. [[[Vex Shadowthorn]] is still alive and has the sixth shard
10. [[The Queen retains enough control to help if approached correctly ## 🎭 [Cliffhanger Ending]] With five shards gathered, the party races toward the festival. They arrive to find thousands of citizens already gathered, swaying in unison. The crystallized Queen stands at the center of a massive runic circle, the sixth shard floating above her. As the sun sets, she speaks in harmony with the crowd: "[[The Seventh comes. The circle closes. Aquabyssos rises." The bloodline carrier feels an irresistible pull toward the circle as their crystalline patterns begin spreading uncontrollably. ## 📝 DM Notes```[Key Decision]] Points:
