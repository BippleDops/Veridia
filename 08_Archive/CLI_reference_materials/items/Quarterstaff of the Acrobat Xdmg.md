While holding this weapon, you can cause it to emit green [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] out to 10 feet, either as a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] or after you roll [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/initiative-xphb|Initiative]], or you can extinguish the light as a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]].

While holding this weapon, you can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] to alter its form, turning it into a 6-inch rod (for ease of storage) or a 10-foot pole, or reverting it a Quarterstaff; the weapon will elongate only as far as the surrounding space allows.

In certain forms, the weapon has the following additional properties.

## Acrobatic Assist (Quarterstaff and 10-Foot Pole Forms Only)

While holding this weapon, you have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on Dexterity ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]) checks.

## Attack Deflection (Quarterstaff Form Only)

When you are hit by an attack while holding the weapon, you can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb|Reaction]] to twirl the weapon around you, gaining a +5 bonus to your [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/armor-class-xphb|Armor Class]] against the triggering attack, potentially causing the attack to miss you. You can't use this property again until you finish a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb|Short]] or [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]].

## Ranged Weapon (Quarterstaff Form Only)

This weapon has [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties#Thrown|Thrown]] with a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with the weapon, it flies back to your hand.
