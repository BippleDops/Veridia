**Sylvan Forest Encounters**

| d12 + d8 | Encounter |
|----------|-----------|
| 2 | 1 [displacer beast](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/displacer-beast-xmm.md) |
| 3 | 1 [gnoll pack lord](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/gnoll-pack-lord-xmm.md) and `2d4` [gnolls](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/gnoll-warrior-xmm.md) |
| 4 | `d4` [gnolls](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/gnoll-warrior-xmm.md) and `2d4` [hyenas](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/hyena-xmm.md) |
| 5 | A grove of burned trees. Characters searching the area and succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom ([Survival](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Survival)) check find [gnoll](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/gnoll-warrior-xmm.md) tracks. Following the tracks for `d4` hours leads to an encounter with [gnolls](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/gnoll-warrior-xmm.md), or the discovery of dead [gnolls](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/gnoll-warrior-xmm.md) with elven arrows sticking out of their flea-ridden corpses. |
| 6 | 1 [giant owl](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/giant-owl-xmm.md) |
| 7 | An ivy-covered statue of an elven deity or hero. |
| 8 | 1 [dryad](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/dryad-xmm.md) (50%) or `d4` [satyrs](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/satyr-xmm.md) (50%) |
| 9 | `d4` [centaurs](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/centaur-trooper-xmm.md) |
| 10 | `2d4` [scouts](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout-xmm.md) (elves). One [scout](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout-xmm.md) carries a horn and can use its action to blow it. If the horn is blown within the forest, roll on this table again. If the result indicates a monster encounter, the indicated monster or monsters arrive in `d4` minutes. New arrivals other than [gnolls](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/gnoll-warrior-xmm.md), [hyenas](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/hyena-xmm.md), [owlbears](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear-xmm.md), and [displacer beasts](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/displacer-beast-xmm.md) are friendly toward the [scouts](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/scout-xmm.md). |
| 11 | `2d4` [pixies](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/pixie-xmm.md) (50%) or `2d4` [sprites](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/sprite-xmm.md) (50%) |
| 12 | 1 [owlbear](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/owlbear-xmm.md) |
| 13 | `d4` [elks](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/elk-xmm.md) (75%) or 1 [giant elk](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/giant-elk-xmm.md) (25%) |
| 14 | `d4` [blink dogs](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/blink-dog-xmm.md) |
| 15 | A magical plant with `2d4` glowing berries. A creature that ingests a berry becomes [invisible](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Invisible) for 1 hour, or until it attacks or casts a spell. Once picked, a berry loses its magic after 12 hours. Berries regrow at midnight, but if all its berries are picked, the plant becomes nonmagical and grows no more berries. |
| 16 | An elven tune carried on a gentle breeze |
| 17 | `d4` [orange](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-youth-xmm.md) (75%) or [blue](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/faerie-dragon-adult-xmm.md) (25%) faerie dragons |
| 18 | 1 [druid](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/druid-xmm.md) (elf). The [druid](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/humanoid/druid-xmm.md) is initially indifferent toward the party but becomes friendly if the characters agree to rid the forest of its gnoll infestation. |
| 19 | 1 [treant](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/treant-xmm.md). The [treant](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/treant-xmm.md) is friendly if the party includes one or more elves or is accompanied by a visible fey creature. The [treant](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/plant/treant-xmm.md) is hostile if the characters are carrying open flames. Otherwise, it is indifferent and doesn't announce its presence as the characters pass by. |
| 20 | 1 [unicorn](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/unicorn-xmm.md) |
