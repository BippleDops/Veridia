*Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 192* To an untrained eye, a fractal mascot looks like a creature made from facets of hard light. But arithmancers know that these fractals are actually living equations: artificial life forms created by extrapolating magic from the mathematical patterns in nature. Because of their arithmetic basis, fractal mascots can alter both their size and density. Quandrix College has adopted the fractal as its mascot, and many a Quandrix student can be found playing fetch with a fractal companion in between lessons.```statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of fractal mascot scc as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around fractal mascot scc. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Related Notes - [[Similar Topic 1
