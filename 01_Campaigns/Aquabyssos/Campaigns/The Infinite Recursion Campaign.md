# The Infinite Recursion Campaign

> *"How deep does reality go? The answer is both infinitely deep and infinitely shallow, depending on your perspective. We discovered we're living in someone else's dream, who is living in someone else's dream, who is living in..."*
> — Final transmission from the Recursion Expedition

## Campaign Overview

The party discovers that reality has layers—recursive dimensions nested inside each other like Russian dolls. What starts as an investigation into spatial anomalies becomes a mind-bending journey through nested realities, where the party must question whether their own world is the "real" one or just another level in an infinite recursion.

## The Central Mystery

### The Recursion Event
Three months ago, explorers in [[The Infinite Garden]] discovered they could enter the crystal fruit growing on trees, finding complete copies of Aquabyssos at 1/10th scale. But those tiny worlds had their own crystal gardens with their own fruit, recursing infinitely. Now, the barriers between recursion levels are breaking down.

### The Five Truths
Players will gradually uncover:
1. **Scale is Relative**: Every level believes it's the "true" reality
2. **The Collapse Protocol**: Someone is deliberately merging the levels
3. **The Original Sin**: Aquabyssos itself might be inside a crystal fruit
4. **The Recursive God**: An entity existing across all scales simultaneously
5. **The Exit Paradox**: Escaping might trap you deeper

## Campaign Structure

### Phase 1: Discovery (Sessions 1-4)
**The Anomaly Investigation**

The party investigates reports of "size crimes"—people shrinking and growing randomly, objects existing at multiple scales simultaneously, and entire districts phasing between dimensions.

**Key Events**:
- Witness a building that's simultaneously massive and microscopic
- Meet themselves from another recursion level
- Discover the first crystal fruit portal
- Learn about the Infinite Garden expedition

**Major NPCs**:
- **Professor Euclid Mindmaze**: Mathematician driven mad by recursive calculations
- **The Size Refugees**: People trapped at the wrong scale
- **Merchant of Scales**: Trades in compressed and expanded matter

### Phase 2: Exploration (Sessions 5-8)
**The Recursive Dive**

The party enters deeper recursion levels, discovering civilizations that have mastered inter-scale travel and others unaware they're in a nested reality.

**Key Locations**:
- **Recursion Level -3**: A militaristic empire conquering "lower" realities
- **Recursion Level -7**: A utopia that discovered they're fictional
- **Recursion Level -13**: Reality breaks down into pure mathematics

**Challenges**:
- Navigate where time moves at different speeds per level
- Prevent a war between recursion levels
- Rescue someone lost in infinite regression
- Decode the Pattern that connects all levels

### Phase 3: Revelation (Sessions 9-12)
**The Scale Wars**

The barriers collapse further. Multiple versions of every person exist simultaneously. Wars break out between recursion levels. The party discovers someone is orchestrating the collapse.

**The Recursion Cult**:
- Believes merging all levels will achieve transcendence
- Led by **The Singular** - a being who merged all their recursive selves
- Has agents in every recursion level
- Plans to collapse all reality into a single point

**Critical Missions**:
- Prevent the assassination of key figures across multiple scales
- Protect the Garden's Heart from cult infiltration
- Gather allies from different recursion levels
- Find the Original Seed that started all recursions

### Phase 4: Convergence (Sessions 13-16)
**The Infinite Crisis**

All recursion levels begin existing simultaneously. Cities overlap at different scales. People meet infinite versions of themselves. Reality struggles to maintain coherence.

**Apocalyptic Events**:
- **The Democracy of Selves**: Everyone votes, but infinite versions create paradoxes
- **The Resource Paradox**: Infinite resources from infinite levels crash economy
- **The Knowledge Cascade**: All versions share memories simultaneously
- **The Size Storm**: Random scaling affects entire regions

### Phase 5: Resolution (Sessions 17-20)
**The Choice of Scales**

The party must decide the fate of the recursive reality:
- **Separation**: Restore barriers, trap some beings at wrong scales
- **Controlled Merger**: Create stable multi-scale society
- **Singular Collapse**: Merge everything into one reality
- **Infinite Expansion**: Open recursions in both directions infinitely
- **The Escape**: Try to reach the "true" reality (if it exists)

## Unique Mechanics

### Recursion Level Tracking
- Party has a "Recursion Level" indicator
- Different levels use different dice (d4 at -10, d20 at 0, d100 at +10)
- Time moves differently (×10 faster each level down)
- Size changes but is relative within each level

### Scale Sickness
Prolonged recursion travel causes:
1. **Mild**: Confusion about current size
2. **Moderate**: Seeing multiple levels simultaneously
3. **Severe**: Existing in multiple levels at once
4. **Critical**: Identity scattered across infinite scales
5. **Terminal**: Become part of the recursion itself

### Paradox Points
Actions that create logical impossibilities generate Paradox Points:
- Meeting yourself from another level: 1 point
- Killing a recursive self: 3 points
- Creating causality loops: 2 points
- 10 points: Reality hiccup (random effect)
- 20 points: Local reality breakdown
- 30 points: Attract attention of the Recursive God

## Key NPCs

### The Infinite Gardener
Exists at every recursion level simultaneously, each a different size but the same consciousness. Claims to have planted the original seed that created all recursions.

### Captain Scale-Walker
A pirate who raids across recursion levels, stealing from civilizations that don't know other scales exist. Has a ship that can sail between dimensions.

### The Recursion Oracle
A prophet who experiences all possible recursions simultaneously, speaking in overlapping truths. Can predict what happens at other scales but at the cost of sanity.

### The Mote Emperor
Rules seventeen levels deep, commanding an empire of microscopic (from party's perspective) but highly advanced civilization. Seeks to conquer "upward."

### The Singular
The campaign's main antagonist—a being who successfully merged all their recursive selves into one consciousness. Now seeks to do the same to all reality.

## Notable Locations

### The Fractal Library
A library that contains all books from all recursion levels. Reading comprehensively about any topic requires exploring infinite scales of detail.

### The Scale Market
A bizarre bazaar where traders from different recursion levels meet. A grain of rice from one level is a feast at another. Currency becomes meaningless.

### The Paradox Palace
A structure that exists at all scales simultaneously. Entering one room might exit you at a different recursion level. The palace's map is itself recursive.

### The Origin Point
The theoretical center of all recursions, where the first crystal tree grew. May or may not exist, may be infinitely large and infinitely small simultaneously.

## Campaign Hooks by Character Type

### For Investigators
- Track a criminal who escapes by shifting recursion levels
- Solve murders where the victim is alive in other recursions
- Investigate why certain people remember other scales

### For Warriors
- Fight in the Scale Wars between recursion levels
- Defend against invasions from microscopic armies
- Duel recursive versions of themselves

### For Scholars
- Study the mathematics of recursive reality
- Discover the original recursion formula
- Map the infinite levels (impossible task)

### For Rogues
- Steal across scales (tiny treasures worth fortunes)
- Infiltrate the Recursion Cult
- Navigate the criminal underground that spans all levels

## Ending Variations

### The Synthesis Ending
All recursions merge into a complex but stable multi-scale society where beings can exist at chosen sizes.

### The Separation Ending  
Barriers are restored stronger than before, but some beings are trapped at wrong scales forever.

### The Transcendence Ending
Party discovers how to exit recursion entirely, finding the "true" reality—or just another level.

### The Recursion Ending
Party realizes they must create the recursion to prevent paradox—they become the Original Gardeners.

### The Infinite Ending
Reality expands in both directions infinitely. Every possibility exists somewhere in the recursion.

## DM Guidance

### Managing Complexity
- Start simple with 3-4 recursion levels
- Use physical props (nested boxes) to demonstrate
- Keep a chart of which level party is on
- Have NPCs struggle with same confusion as players

### Memorable Moments
- Party fights giant and tiny versions of same enemy simultaneously
- Negotiate peace treaty between levels where one side is microscopic
- Discover their own adventure is a story in another recursion's library
- Race against time moving at different speeds per level

### Integration with Other Campaigns
- **Aethermoor**: Crystal plague creates recursions in victims
- **Parliament of Shadows**: Senators exist at multiple scales
- **Memory Wars**: Each recursion has different history
