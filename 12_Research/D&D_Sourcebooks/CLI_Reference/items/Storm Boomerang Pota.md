*Weapon, uncommon* - **Damage**: 1d4 bludgeoning
- **Range**: 60/120 This boomerang is a ranged weapon carved from [[griffon-xmm (monstrosity)]] bone and etched with the symbol of elemental air. When thrown, it has a range of 60/120 feet, and any creature that is proficient with the javelin is also proficient with this weapon. On a hit, the boomerang deals`d4`bludgeoning damage and`3d4`thunder damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [[conditions#Stunned|stunned]] until the end of its next turn. On a miss, the boomerang returns to the thrower's hand. Once the boomerang deals thunder damage to a target, the weapon loses its ability to deal thunder damage and its ability to stun a target. These properties return after the boomerang spends at least 1 hour inside an elemental air node. *Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 223* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Storm boomerang pota is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
