## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing an aboleth's lair is warped by it, creating the following effects:

- **Foul Water.** Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Creatures other than the aboleth and its allies that drink such water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition for 1 hour.  
- **Psionic Projection.** While in its lair, the aboleth can cast [[project-image-xphb|Project Image]], requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16). When casting the spell this way, the spell's range is 1 mile, and the aboleth can use its telepathy as if it were in the illusion's space.  

If the aboleth dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

## Player-Facing Summary

Aboleth xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of aboleth xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around aboleth xmm.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
