***Shargaas's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the orc's darkvision.

***Slayer.*** In the first round of a combat, the orc has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn yet. If the orc hits a creature that round who was surprised, the hit is automatically a critical hit.

***Veil of Shargaas (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The orc casts darkness without any components. Wisdom is its spellcasting ability.

## Description
Shargaas is the ore deity of deep darkness and sneakiness, a murderous god who hates anything that lives that isn't an ore. Ores consider Shargaas to be a divinity suited to pariahs and weaklings, all of them unfit for true roles in tribal life. These outsiders live in the most remote, deepest parts of the tribe's domain.

The elite among Shargaas's followers are the assassins and thieves that follow the cult of the Red Fang. They perform assassinations, stealthy raids, and other covert operations on the tribe's behalf. They rely on a mix of intense training and magic granted to them by Shargaas.

Most Red Fang enclaves keep and nurture giant bats, creatures that are sacred to Shargaas. Red Fangs ride these bats into battle or on secret raids and assassination missions into enemy territory.
