# Animate Blood (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 150 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (6 drops of your blood)

**Duration**: 10 minutes


## Effects
You animate your own blood, creating six tiny, droplet-shaped constructs; these drop-lets are blood-red and have small black eyes. Each of these droplets has AC 14, 2 hp, a speed of 60, Stealth +10, and the ability to long-jump 20 feet and high-jump 10 feet. Any droplet that moves more than 150 feet away from you becomes inert.

You are mentally linked to each of the droplets and may switch your perception to one of the creatures in order to use their senses as your own by using your action.

You may also use your action to direct one of the droplets to attack, using your spell attack modifier. If your attack succeeds, the droplet has hit, causing 3d10 acid damage and 3d10 necrotic damage.
