# Riposte
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 95*  

When a creature misses you with a melee attack roll, you can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb|Reaction]] and expend one Superiority Die to make a melee attack roll with a weapon or an [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/unarmed-strike-xphb|Unarmed Strike]] against the creature. If you hit, add the Superiority Die to the attack's damage.
