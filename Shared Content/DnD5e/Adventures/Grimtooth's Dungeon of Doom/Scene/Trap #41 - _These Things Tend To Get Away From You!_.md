# Trap #41 - "These Things Tend To Get Away From You!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> There is an open doorway leading out of this room on the wall to the left of the entry. There is a hidden door directly opposite the store room entrance, but the party will have to find it. Detection magic, or stucco flaking again is required. If the party does detect it and goes that way advance in the text to LOADING THE GUN, and continue on. If the party looks to the open doorway this is what they find.
> 
> First they will find a small plaque on the wall about eye level to a human. It is inscribed, West Construction, Wayne West Chief Engineer. They also find themselves looking down a long flight of stairs into the darkness.
> 
> These stairs are over 70 feet long. Magic users will detect a slight magical aura. Each step is possessed of a low level magical charm. It appears to be akin to some of the less effective spells of combat enhancement that lower level wizards might cast. It has been laid on in such a way that it cannot be dispelled, but on the whole is not too threatening.
> 
> If any member of the party elects to try the stairs the spells effect will become obvious. Each step doubles the rate of speed at which it was entered. Step down at walking pace, the next step is taken at a trot, then a run, by turn four the character is sprinting! There are 70 steps the speeds attainable can be amazing.
> 
> The character will not be able to control his momentum by conventional means. Though you may find that clever delvers will attempt various devices, I leave it to you to judge their success. (Once again a wizard could fly off then regain control, but. others who must remain in the grip of gravity will have to resort to more innovative solutions.)
> 
> At the bottom of the stairs is a locked stone door. At the speed the delver should be going there is certain to be a wonderful, SPLAT! or at the very least the satisfying CRUNCH! of breaking bones. In the event that the delver or delvers can open the door on the fly, with a spell or magic charm, an even greater swprise awaits them.
> 
> This trap will work in reverse, accelerating upwards until at blinding speed the stair climber is propelled into the Acid pool room and into the 2 foot high edge of the pool itself. There is only a 10% chance (L 7) to avoid falling into the pool unless the character can find a way to slow down! (I really love it when these things work so well in both directions.)
> 
> Up or down this babe is a four skull er. In acid or onto spears at several times the speed a man can run with virtually no safeguards... Even if the character runs into the door at the bottom without opening it the result will be heralded by the satisfying crunch of breaking bones. These are a few of my favorite sounds ...
