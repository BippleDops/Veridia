# Pot of Awakening

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** common

## Description

If you plant an ordinary shrub in this 10-pound clay pot and let it grow for 30 days, the shrub magically transforms into an [[awakened shrub]] at the end of that time. When the shrub awakens, its roots break the pot, destroying it.

The awakened shrub is friendly toward you. Absent commands from you, it does nothing.
