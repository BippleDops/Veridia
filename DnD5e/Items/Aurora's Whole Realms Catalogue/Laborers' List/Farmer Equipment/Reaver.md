## Description
An old Vaasan saying states that “A reaver is a [[Scythe|scythe]] gone mad.” Indeed, those who have seen reaving laborers in the field might think so, for the whirling flash and scissoring scrape of the blades fills the air. In fact, reavers are simple, dual-bladed devices hinged at the tip. When swung, the blades extend until they strike an obstacle, whereby they fold and scissor together. Some say reavers halve their harvest time. Our reavers come with a leather strap for binding the blades when not in use. (5 gp) Reaver:
