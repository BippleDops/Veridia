# Commander's Strike
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 94*  

When you take the [[actions#Attack|Attack]] action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a willing creature who can see or hear you and expend one Superiority Die. That creature can immediately use its [[reaction-xphb|Reaction]] to make one attack with a weapon or an [[unarmed-strike-xphb|Unarmed Strike]], adding the Superiority Die to the attack's damage roll on a hit.
