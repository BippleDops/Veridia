## Player-Facing Summary

The Biomancers is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of The Biomancers as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Biomancers.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties The Biomancers to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at The Biomancers to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to The Biomancers active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
