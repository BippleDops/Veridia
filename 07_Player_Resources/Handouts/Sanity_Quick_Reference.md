# Sanity Quick Reference
*When Reality Breaks*

## What Is Sanity?

Sanity represents your character's mental resilience when confronting the incomprehensible. In a world where shadows can think, memories can be stolen, and the depths hide impossible truths, maintaining mental stability is as important as physical health.

## Your Sanity Points

**Starting Sanity**: (Wisdom Score × 5) + Character Level + Background Modifier

**Background Modifiers**:
- Soldier/Guard: +5 (hardened by violence)
- Scholar/Sage: -5 (know too much)
- Noble: +0 (sheltered but fragile)
- Criminal: +3 (familiar with darkness)
- Folk Hero: +5 (grounded in simple truths)
- Hermit: -3 (isolation breeds strange thoughts)
- Acolyte: +2 (faith provides anchor)

## Making Sanity Saves

When you encounter something that challenges your understanding of reality:

**Roll**: 1d20 + Wisdom modifier + Proficiency (if proficient in Wisdom saves)

**Common DCs**:
- DC 10: Witnessing brutal violence
- DC 12: Seeing unnatural transformations
- DC 15: Encountering creatures that shouldn't exist
- DC 18: Learning reality-breaking truths
- DC 20+: Direct contact with primordial forces

## Sanity Damage

**Failed Save**: Lose sanity points based on severity
- Minor (DC 10-12): 1d4 points
- Moderate (DC 13-15): 1d6 points
- Major (DC 16-19): 1d8 points

### Therapeutic Help
- **Counseling**: Professional help grants 1d4+1 per session

- **Magic**: Divine magic can restore sanity (limited uses)

## Short-Term Effects (1d10 minutes)

When you experience a short-term break:
1. **Panic** — Must flee or hide

- Know your limits

### In the Moment
- Look away when possible
