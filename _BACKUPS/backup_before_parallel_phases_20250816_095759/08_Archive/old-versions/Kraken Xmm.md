_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_ The region containing a kraken's lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects: - **Ocean Tyrant.** The kraken exerts its domice over animals in its domain. All Beasts within 1 mile of the lair have the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed condition while in that area. - **Sea and Storms.** While in its lair, the kraken can cast [weather]], requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability. If the kraken dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. ## Player-Facing Summary Kraken xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of kraken xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around kraken xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The First Prophecy of Winds ## Plot Hooks - Someone is protecting a witness for money
