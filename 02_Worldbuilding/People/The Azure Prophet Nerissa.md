# The Azure Prophet Nerissa
*Speaker for the Sunken Shard, Voice of the Depths*

## Overview
The Azure Prophet Nerissa is believed to be the only living mortal who has direct communion with the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards|Azure Shard]], which lies buried in a sunken temple beneath [[The Azure Coast]]. Through dreams and visions, the Shard shows her glimpses of possible futuresâ€”all of them involving rising seas and emotional transformation. She wanders the coastal regions, gathering followers and preparing for what she calls "the Great Tide."

## Description
- **Appearance**: Ethereal sea elf with silver-blue hair that moves like underwater kelp
- **Eyes**: Deep blue with flecks of silver, seem to reflect depths of ocean
- **Mark of the Shard**: Intricate wave patterns flow across her skin when she prophesies
- **Voice**: Speaks in rhythmic cadences that match the sound of waves
- **Presence**: Emanates calm that can soothe even the most troubled souls

## Background
### The Calling
- Born to a traditional sea elf clan on [[The Azure Coast]]
- Experienced prophetic dreams from childhood
- At age 16, had a vision that led her to dive impossibly deep
- Briefly touched the Azure Shard in its sunken temple
- Emerged three days later, transformed and speaking prophecies

### The Wandering Years
- Spent 12 years traveling coastal communities
- Gathered followers among fishers, sailors, and coastal dwellers
- Predicted storms, tides, and sea disasters with perfect accuracy
- Founded the [[The Tide Speakers]] as a loose network of believers
- Never stays in one place more than a few months

## Prophetic Abilities
### Visions from the Azure Shard
- **Storm Sight**: Predicts weather and sea conditions weeks in advance
- **Emotional Currents**: Sees the flow of human emotions and relationships
- **Tide Dreams**: Visions of possible futures, always involving water
- **Soul Deep**: Can perceive people's deepest fears and desires
- **Shard Resonance**: Senses when other Shards are active or moving

### The Great Tide Prophecy
*"When the Seven become One, the Great Tide rises. Not of water alone, but of feeling, washing away all pretense and lies. Those who fight the current will drown in their own deceptions. Those who swim with it will find depths they never knew existed."*

### Beliefs
