*Weapon ([[Battleaxe Xphb)* - **Damage**: - One-handed: `dice: 1d8` slashing - Two-handed: `dice: 1d10` slashing
- **Properties**: [item properties#Versatile|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs. This +1 battleaxe deals maximum damage when the wielder hits a plant creature or an object made of wood. The axe's creator was a dwarf smith who feuded with the dryads of a forest where he cut firewood. Whoever carries the axe feels uneasy whenever he or she travels through a forest. *Source: Lost Mine of Phandelver p. 33* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Hew lmop is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of hew lmop as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around hew lmop. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Second Prophecy of Depths ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[Master_Item_Catalog]]
