# INV-001

*"The first case that opened our eyes to the truth beneath the surface."*

## Overview
INV-001 represents the inaugural investigation conducted by inter-realm authorities into anomalous phenomena affecting both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. This foundational case involved the mysterious synchronization of tidal patterns with surface weather systems, leading to the discovery of previously unknown magical connections between the realms.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
- High-level authorization from both realm governments
- Cross-realm investigative team coordination
- Access to environmental monitoring data
- Specialized detection equipment for magical phenomena

### Effects
- **Pattern Recognition**: Established baseline for anomaly detection
- **Protocol Development**: Created investigation procedures still used today
- **Inter-realm Cooperation**: Fostered collaborative investigation methods
- **Precedent Setting**: Became model for future investigations

### Duration
Official investigation lasted six months, with ongoing implications for current policy.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Case Review**: Characters investigate discrepancies in original findings
2. **Copycat Phenomenon**: Similar patterns emerge requiring new investigation
3. **Classified Evidence**: Discovery of suppressed evidence from original case

## Campaign Use
Provides historical foundation for investigation-based adventures and inter-realm cooperation storylines.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
