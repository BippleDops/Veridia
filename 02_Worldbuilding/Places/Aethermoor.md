# Aethermoor
*The Shattered Crown Continent*

## Overview
Aethermoor is a continent forever changed by the Great Crystallization, an event 500 years ago when massive spires of crystallized magic erupted from the earth. These Aether Crystals grant incredible magical power but come with a terrible price - prolonged exposure causes crystalline corruption, slowly transforming living beings into crystal themselves.

#### The Shattering (500 years ago)
[[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Crystallization]] - Aetheron was betrayed by his seven advisors. The Crown of Stars shattered, its fragments piercing the earth and emerging as Aether Crystals. This event is detailed in [[The Shattering of the Crown]].

Five centuries of adaptation to crystal magic. The rise of the [[Crystal Wardens]], the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Purist Coalition]], and other factions vying for control.
