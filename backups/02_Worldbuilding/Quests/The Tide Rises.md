# The Tide Rises

*Missing nobles, diplomatic immunity, and a conspiracy that threatens to drown Aethermoor*

## Quest Overview
Several lesser nobles from [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven]] have vanished after attending "cultural exchange" events at [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Drowned Embassy|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Drowned Embassy]]. [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Captain Lyanna Brightshield|02 Worldbuilding/People/Captain Lyanna Brightshield]] suspects foul play but cannot legally investigate due to diplomatic immunity. The party must uncover the truth while navigating international incidents and discovering a threat greater than anyone imagined.

## Quest Giver
**[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Captain Lyanna Brightshield|02 Worldbuilding/People/Captain Lyanna Brightshield]]** approaches the party unofficially, as official channels are blocked by diplomatic protocols.

## Background
Three nobles - Lord Aldric Wavecrest, Lady Marea Shelworth, and Sir Donnel Clearwater - attended Embassy events over the past two months and haven't been seen since. [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Korvin Blacktide|02 Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Korvin Blacktide]] claims they left safely, but their families report strange dreams of drowning and whispered words in unknown languages.

- Obtain evidence of [[Aquabyssos]] invasion plans
- Turn [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Korvin Blacktide|02 Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Korvin Blacktide]] into a double agent
- Prevent the opening of the Deep Gate

## Key NPCs Involved

## Investigation Paths

### The Diplomatic Route
- Attend Embassy function undercover
- Gain Korvin's trust through mutual interests
- Access restricted areas during events
- Risk: Possible corruption or transformation

### The Criminal Route  
- Work with [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn|02 Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]] to access smuggling tunnels
- Infiltrate through underwater passages from [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]]
- Bribe or threaten Embassy staff
- Risk: Starting a gang war

### The Military Route
- Convince [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Sir Marcus Dawnforge|02 Worldbuilding/People/Sir Marcus Dawnforge]] to use Order authority

- Force entry with legal justification
- Risk: International incident, war with [[Aquabyssos]]

### The Economic Route

- Buy information from Embassy staff
- Risk: Economic retaliation, Confederate involvement

## Revelations & Twists

### The Noble's Fate
The nobles are alive but being transformed into Deep Heralds in the Embassy's flooded cells. They're nearly complete - in 3 days, they'll be sent back as sleeper agents.

### The Blackmail Web
[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde|02 Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]] knew about the kidnappings but is being blackmailed by Korvin, who has evidence of her corruption. She's been providing him with information about crystal defenses.

### The Greater Threat
The missing nobles are part of a ritual to open the Deep Gate. Their bloodlines are tied to ancient pacts that seal the boundary between realms. Once transformed, their corrupted blood will break these seals.

### The Goldspire Connection
[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Zephyr Goldwhisper|02 Worldbuilding/People/Zephyr Goldwhisper]] and the Confederacy know about the threat and are prepared to use their Null Bombs to destroy the entire Embassy district if necessary, casualties included.

## DM Secrets
> [!warning] Timeline Pressure
> - Day 1-2: Investigation phase, gathering clues
> - Day 3: Transformation completes if not stopped
> - Day 4: Sleeper agents activated or Deep Gate ritual begins
> - Day 5: Either invasion begins or Goldspire implements scorched earth

> [!danger] The Moral Dilemma
> The nobles can be saved, but they've already been partially transformed. Saving them means they'll carry Aquabyssos corruption forever, potentially spreading it. Killing them prevents the invasion but murders innocents. Letting them transform might be the only way to learn Aquabyssos's true plans.

> [!info] Hidden Ally
> Tidecaller Nerissa, Korvin's attaché, is having doubts about the plan. She was once from Aethermoor and still has family in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]]. She can be turned with the right approach.

## Encounters

### Embassy Infiltration
- **Drowned Chorus** (12 cultists, CR 2 each)
- **Water Weird** guardians in flooded sections

### Rescue Mission

## Consequences & Follow-ups
