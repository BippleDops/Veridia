# Bestow Curse
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You touch a creature, which must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become cursed for the duration. Until the curse ends, the target suffers one of the following effects of your choice:

- Choose one ability. The target has [[disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability.  
- The target has [[disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on attack rolls against you.  
- In combat, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns or be forced to take the [[actions#Dodge|Dodge]] action on that turn.  
- If you deal damage to the target with an attack roll or a spell, the target takes an extra `d8` Necrotic damage.  

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** If you cast this spell using a level 4 spell slot, you can maintain [[conditions#Concentration|Concentration]] on it for up to 10 minutes. If you use a level 5+ spell slot, the spell doesn't require [[conditions#Concentration|Concentration]], and the duration becomes 8 hours (level 5-6 slot) or 24 hours (level 7-8 slot). If you use a level 9 spell slot, the spell lasts until dispelled.
