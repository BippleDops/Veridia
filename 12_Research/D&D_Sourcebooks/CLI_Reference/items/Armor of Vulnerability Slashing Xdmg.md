# Armor of Vulnerability (Slashing)
*Cursed item, rare (requires attunement)*  


- **Properties**: [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties#Cursed%20Items|Cursed]]

While wearing this armor, you have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/resistance-xphb|Resistance]] to Slashing damage.

## Curse

This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/identify-xphb|Identify]] spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/remove-curse-xphb|Remove Curse]] spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/vulnerability-xphb|Vulnerability]] to Bludgeoning and Piercing damage.
