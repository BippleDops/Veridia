*Medium armor* - **Armor Class**: 15 + Dex modifier (max of +2)
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.
- **Weight**: 40.0 lbs. This carapace-like augmentation encases portions of the wearer's shoulders, neck, and chest. A survival mantle is equivalent to a suit of nonmagical half plate armor and takes just as long to don or doff. It can't be worn with other kinds of armor. A creature wearing a survival mantle can breathe normally in any environment (including a vacuum) and has advantage on saving throws against harmful gases (such as those created by a [[Cloudkill Xphb spell, a [stinking-cloud-xphb (spells)]] spell, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons). *Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 81* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Survival mantle vgm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.

Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
