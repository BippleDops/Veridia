# Ring of Free Action
*Ring, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/ring-of-free-action.webp#right)


While you wear this ring, [Difficult Terrain](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md) doesn't cost you extra movement. In addition, magic can neither reduce any of your Speeds nor cause you to have the [Paralyzed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Paralyzed) or [Restrained](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Restrained) condition.
