## Special Traits
***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny snake. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.

## Actions
***Bites.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm's space. Hit: 7 (`dice: 2d6`) piercing damage, or 3 (`dice: 1d6`) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. The target must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (`dice: 4d6`) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
