## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The mind flayer is a 10th-level spellcaster. Its innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 15; +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

1st level (4 slots): *charm person, command, comprehend languages, sanctuary*

2nd level (3 slots): *crown of madness, phantasmal force, see invisibility*

3rd level (3 slots): *clairvoyance, fear, meld into stone*

4th level (3 slots): *confusion, stone shape*

5th level (2 slots): *scrying, telekinesis*

At will: *guidance, mage hand, vicious mockery, true strike*

***Magic Resistance.*** The mind flayer has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions
***Tentacles.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (`dice: 2d10+4`) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 15) and must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until this grapple ends.

***Extract Brain.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one incapacitated humanoid grappled by the mind flayer. Hit: The target takes 55 (`dice: 10d10`) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the mind flayer kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.

***Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6).*** The mind flayer magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (`dice: 4d8+4`) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
