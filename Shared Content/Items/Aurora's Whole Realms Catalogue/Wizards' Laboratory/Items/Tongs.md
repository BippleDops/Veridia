## Description
Though [[Gloves|gloves]] work fairly well for some tasks, white-hot objects, acid-filled containers, and flaming coals call for more distance from the subject. With our small tongs (1 gp), a mage can easily manipulate [[Beakers|vials]], [[Beakers|beakers]], and embers. With our large tongs (3 gp), a mage could well hammer out a shoe for his favorite horse, if he wished.

## Additional Details
2 pairs of each size are required for a complete laboratory
