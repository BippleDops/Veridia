# Shadow Conspiracy: Investigation Mechanics
*Complete System for Uncovering the Conspiracy*

> [!info] Investigation Framework
> This investigation system combines:
> - Evidence collection and verification
> - NPC interrogation and trust building
> - Shadow detection techniques
> - Timeline pressure and consequences
> - Multiple solution paths

## Evidence Collection System

### Evidence Points Tracking

The party needs **10 Evidence Points** to publicly expose the conspiracy and gain governmental support.

```meta-bind
INPUT[progressBar(minValue(0), maxValue(10)):evidence-points]
LABEL[Evidence Points Collected]
```

### Evidence Categories

#### Documentary Evidence (1-2 points each)
- **Parliamentary Voting Records**: Impossible unanimous votes
- **Medical Files**: Shadow surgery patient records
- **Financial Ledgers**: Unexplained fund transfers
- **Communication Intercepts**: Coded shadow messages
- **Personnel Files**: Staff with memory gaps

#### Physical Evidence (2-3 points each)
- **Shadow Surgery Tools**: Specialized medical equipment
- **Consciousness Crystals**: Storage devices for stolen personalities
- **Shadow Essence Samples**: Proof of consciousness manipulation
- **Surgical Scars**: Physical marks on victims
- **Shadow Duplicate Remains**: Bodies that dissolve into shadow

#### Witness Testimony (1 point each, 2 if high-ranking)
- **Escaped Victims**: First-hand surgery accounts
- **Whistleblowers**: Inside information from conspirators
- **Medical Staff**: Witnessed strange procedures
- **Security Personnel**: Observed suspicious behavior
- **Family Members**: Noticed personality changes

#### Captured Conspirators (3-4 points)
- **Shadow Surgeon**: Direct evidence of techniques
- **Corrupted Official**: Proof of governmental infiltration
- **Shadow Duplicate**: Living evidence of the conspiracy
- **Conspiracy Coordinator**: Knowledge of network structure

### Evidence Verification

Not all evidence is genuine. The conspiracy plants false leads.

```dice-roller
dice: 1d20
Evidence Verification Check
1-5: False evidence (lose 1 point if accepted)
6-10: Partial truth (half value)
11-15: Genuine (full value)
16-20: Exceptional quality (+1 bonus point)
```

### Evidence Chain Requirements

Some evidence requires prior discoveries:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Voting Anomalies] --> B[Parliament Investigation]
    B --> C[Shadow Chamber Discovery]
    C --> D[Full Member List]
    
    E[Medical Anomalies] --> F[Surgery Facility]
    F --> G[Patient Records]
    G --> H[Victim Identities]
    
    I[Financial Irregularities] --> J[Money Trail]
    J --> K[Conspiracy Funding]
    K --> L[Leadership Identity]
```

## Shadow Detection Methods

### Physical Detection

#### Environmental Signs
- **Temperature**: Drops 5-10Â°F near shadow-touched
- **Light Behavior**: Shadows move independently
- **Mirrors**: Show different or no reflections
- **Animals**: React with fear or aggression

#### Medical Examination
DC 15 Medicine check reveals:
- Surgical scars at skull base
- Unusual neural activity patterns
- Dual pulse rhythms
- Memory gaps in recent events

### Magical Detection

#### Spell Effectiveness
| Spell | Effect on Shadow-Touched | DC to Resist |
|-------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Detect Evil and Good | Shows as aberration | Auto-success |
| Detect Thoughts | Reveals dual consciousness | DC 18 Wisdom |
| Zone of Truth | Causes system conflict | DC 15 Constitution |
| True Seeing | Shows shadow overlay | Auto-success |
| Identify | Reveals shadow surgery | DC 20 Investigation |

#### Custom Detection Ritual
**Shadow Resonance Test** (10 minutes, requires shadow detection kit)
- All shadow-touched within 30 feet must make DC 15 Charisma save
- On failure, shadow aura becomes visible for 1 hour
- On success, they're aware of the detection attempt

### Behavioral Detection

#### Pattern Recognition (Insight DC varies)
- **DC 10**: Notice unusually coordinated behavior
- **DC 15**: Detect scripted speech patterns
- **DC 18**: Identify memory inconsistencies
- **DC 20**: Predict shadow agent actions

#### Social Tests
**Memory Verification**: Ask about shared past experiences
**Emotional Response**: Shadow-touched have limited emotional range
**Personal Habits**: Original personality quirks are absent
**Decision Patterns**: Always choose options benefiting conspiracy

## Investigation Tools

### Shadow Detection Kit
*Rare adventuring gear, 500 gp*

**Contents**:
- Specialized mirror (shows true reflection)
- Temperature-sensitive crystals
- Memory verification questions
- Behavioral pattern guide
- Evidence collection tools

**Use**: Advantage on Investigation checks related to shadow detection

### Consciousness Scanner

**Properties**:
- 3 charges, regains 1d3 at dawn
- **Scan (1 charge)**: Detect shadow-touched within 30 feet
- **Deep Scan (2 charges)**: Reveal specific shadow modifications
- **Purge (3 charges)**: Attempt to remove shadow control (DC 18 Wisdom save)

### Memory Archive Crystal
*Rare wondrous item*

**Properties**:
- Stores up to 10 memories for comparison
- Compare memories between individuals
- Detect altered or implanted memories
- Preserve evidence of consciousness manipulation

## NPC Interrogation System

### Trust Building Mechanics

```meta-bind
INPUT[slider(minValue(-10), maxValue(10)):npc-trust]
LABEL[NPC Trust Level]
```

#### Trust Modifiers
- **Saved their life**: +3
- **Exposed conspiracy evidence**: +2
- **Shared personal vulnerability**: +1
- **Professional approach**: +0
- **Aggressive questioning**: -2
- **Threatened or intimidated**: -3
- **Associated with conspiracy**: -5

### Interrogation Techniques

#### Soft Approach (Persuasion)
- Build rapport over multiple conversations
- Share information to gain trust
- Appeal to moral conscience
- Offer protection or rewards

```dice-roller
dice: 1d20+CHA
Soft Interrogation
DC = 15 - (Trust Level)
```

#### Hard Approach (Intimidation)
- Immediate results but damages trust
- May trigger shadow defensive protocols
- Can cause witnesses to flee
- Sometimes necessary for time pressure

```dice-roller
dice: 1d20+STR/CHA
Hard Interrogation
DC = 20 - (Fear Level)
```

#### Analytical Approach (Investigation)
- Catch inconsistencies in stories
- Cross-reference with evidence
- Build logical case
- Expose lies through facts

```dice-roller
dice: 1d20+INT
Analytical Interrogation
DC = 18 - (Evidence Points/2)
```
