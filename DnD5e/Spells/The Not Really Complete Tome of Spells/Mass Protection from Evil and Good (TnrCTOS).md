# Mass Protection from Evil and Good (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (holy water or pow-dered silver and iron, which the spell con-sumes)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes For the duration, you and up to eight willing creatures you choose that are within range are protected against certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.


## Effects
The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target also canâ€™t be charmed, frightened, or pos-sessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against the relevant effect.
