*Source: Player's Handbook p. 196. Available in the SRD and the Basic Rules (2014)* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Acid The corrosive spray of a black dragon's breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage. ## Bludgeoning Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage. ## Cold The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil's spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon's breath deal cold damage. ## Fire Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage. ## Force Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon. ## Lightning A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon's breath deal lightning damage. ## Necrotic Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and some spells, withers matter and even the soul. ## Piercing Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters' bites, deal piercing damage. ## Poison Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon's breath deal poison damage. ## Psychic Mental abilities such as a mind flayer's psionic blast deal psychic damage. ## Radiant Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric's flame strike spell or an angel's smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power. ## Slashing Swords, axes, and monsters' claws deal slashing damage. ## Thunder A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage. ## Player-Facing Summary Damage types is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of damage types as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around damage types. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is hunting a artifact for power
