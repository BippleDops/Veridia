# Fly
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a feather)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target gains a [[fly-speed-xphb|Fly Speed]] of 60 feet and can hover. When the spell ends, the target falls if it is still aloft unless it can stop the fall.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 3.

## Player-Facing Summary

Fly xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

Legends speak of fly xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around fly xphb.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
