Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Brave Depthfixer as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Brave Depthfixer. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Shadow Alliance - Control trade routes ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Second Prophecy of Winds ## Plot Hooks - Strange accidents suggest a curse
