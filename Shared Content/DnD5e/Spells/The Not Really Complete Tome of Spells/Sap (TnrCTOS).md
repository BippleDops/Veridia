# Sap (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a drop of tree sap)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You choose a point within range. Everything within a 10-foot radius of that point is covered in sticky tree sap.

The area becomes difficult terrain. In order to perform any action that is not purely mental or vocal in nature requires a DC 10 Dexterity ability check first. Creatures in the area lose their Dexterity bonus to AC. Winged creatures cannot fly. A creature under the effects of a *freedom of movement* spell is unaffected by this spell.
