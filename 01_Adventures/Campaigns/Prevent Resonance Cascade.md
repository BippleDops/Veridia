--- # Prevent Resoce Cascade *"When magic itself begins to unravel, heroes must act before reality tears apart."* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Preventing a Resoce Cascade involves stopping the catastrophic chain reaction that occurs when magical energies between Aquabyssos and Aethermoor become destabilized and begin feeding back on themselves. This phenomenon threatens to tear apart the barriers between realms, potentially destroying both worlds in a cascade of uncontrolled magical energy. The cascade begins when dimensional stress points reach critical thresholds, causing magic itself to become unstable. Spells begin failing unpredictably, magical items overload, and reality itself starts to warp around areas of high magical concentration. ## Historical Background

Resoce cascades were first theorized after minor magical feedback events during early inter-realm magical experiments. The devastating potential was confirmed when a small-scale cascade destroyed an entire research facility, creating a permanent magical dead zone. ## Current State

Warning signs of an impending major cascade are becoming apparent: increased magical instability, dimensional barrier fluctuations, and reports of reality distortions in high-magic areas. Prevention requires coordinated action across both realms. ### Duration

Prevention efforts must be completed within days or hours once cascade signs appear. ## Adventure Hooks

1. **Early Warning**: Characters detect the first signs of cascade formation
2. **Emergency Response**: Racing against time to prevent cascade initiation
3. **Damage Control**: Managing the aftermath of a partially successful prevention effort ## Campaign Use

Ideal for high-stakes adventures where character actions have world-changing consequences. Can serve as campaign climax or major story arc resolution. ## Player-Facing Summary Prevent Resoce Cascade is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Prevent Resoce Cascade as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Prevent Resoce Cascade. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is hunting a witness for love
