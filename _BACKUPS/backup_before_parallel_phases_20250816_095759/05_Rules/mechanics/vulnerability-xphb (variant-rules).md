*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 377. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* If you have Vulnerability to a [[Damage Types]], damage of that type is doubled against you. Vulnerability is applied only once to an instance of damage. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Vulnerability xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of vulnerability xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around vulnerability xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Second Prophecy of Shadows ## Plot Hooks - A letter reveals a conspiracy about a local noble

- A shipment has gone missing and evil awakens ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
