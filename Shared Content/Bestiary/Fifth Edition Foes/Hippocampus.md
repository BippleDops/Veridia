## Description
A hippocampus is often called a merhorse or sea horse, for it is indeed half horse/half fish and lives entirely in the sea. The hindquarters of the animal are that of a great fish. The front (horse) portion of its body is covered in fine scales, and the rear (fish) portion is covered in large scales. The scales vary in color from ivory to deep green, mixed with shades of blue and silver.

Aquatic races sometimes tame these animals, because hippocampi make fine steeds. They are strong, swift, and smarter than horses; they can be taught hundreds of words, and some actually learn to speak the language of their riders. Hippocampi are docile creatures that fight only if they or an ally is threatened.

## Training a Hippocampus
A hippocampus requires training before it will carry a rider, in combat or otherwise. To be trained, a hippocampus must have a friendly attitude toward the trainer (this can be achieved through a successful Diplomacy check). Training a friendly hippocampus as a mount takes six weeks of work concluding with a successful DC 15 Wis (Animal Handling) check. A failed check can be retried after another three weeks of remedial training. If that fails, the hippocampus is untrainable.

Riding a hippocampus requires an exotic saddle. Riding a hippocampus in combat involves the rules for mounted combat and for fighting underwater.

Hippocampus eggs are worth 1,000 to 1,500 gp apiece, depending on local demand. A young, untrained hippocampus can [[Fetch|fetch]] twice as much. Professional trainers (tritons sometimes specialize in this) charge 1,000 gp to rear or train a hippocampus.
