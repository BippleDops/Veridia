# Drought (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 hour

**Range**: Self (300-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (a dried rat)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You spend an hour meditating and the area around you becomes much drier than before. If the land was wet and swampy, the water drains away. If it was a field or forest, the ground withers to dust and the vegeta-tion begins to die within a few days.

This spell doesnâ€™t work if cast on an area with more than a foot of standing water.

A particular plot of land can only be af-fected by this spell once per season, and the effects last until the end of the current growing season.
