# Trap #50 - "Some How This All Seems Too Easy!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The bronze door near the entry tunnel is fairly typical of those found so far. Very fine truely artistic work, its estimated value is 1,200 g.p. in art and construction. On its surface are depicted the images of a man and a woman. The man is clearly Evinrood (The fact that he comes up to the woman's chin reveals the stumpy stature that has come to be associated with past images found in the tomb.) The woman is tall and lithe, even the image betrays a fluid grace that transcends the time since the door's crafting. In the background are some of the most bizarre creatures seen yet. They look like the deamon dogs found as statuary in certain eastern temples. They are leaping playfully about the couple's feet. The couple depicted are clearly not engaged in combat. 
> 
> The wheel in the door's center must be turned for the door to be opened. Once the party resolves to do so the delver who does the turning will hear a rushing sound, as if a source of water has been released. The door will take many turns to open and when it does it will reveal a vault like thickness which serves to explain why it was not blown open by the blast. The door opens into the flour room which could be a problem, but by now the party should have that troublsome explosion problem under control! Even so the door is unlikely to be opened all the way. It is after all, at the bottom of 18 feet of flour. 
> 
> The party will be able to squeeze into a hall 10 feet wide and 15 tall, that slants slightly downward. The hall is 40 feet long, and has one additional unique feature. Just inside the doorway is a grating in the floor out of which is pouring a steady stream of water. It covers the floor from wall to wall, and runs smoothly down into the room below. The water stream is only about 2 or 3 inches deep. From the room below is coming a pale blue light. 
> 
> Thrashing through this rivulet to [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] of the chamber below the party will be confronted with a scene of unearthly beauty. The room is 50 by 50 feet square, with a 25 foot high ceiling. It, like the hall leading into it, is slightly slanted downward away from [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]]. All along the wall nearest the party is a grating out of which pours more water. This covers the entire floor with a softly gurgling sheen of water just like the hall. The water appears to be drained off at the far wall, but in the dim blue glow the party can't see the drain gratings. 
> 
> The walls are tiled in a scintilating blue which seems to give off the pale blue glow. Opposite the door the party is standing in there is a raised dais. On this dais is a sarcophagus of the same rare hy-Atlantaen stone seen in the room of the Terra-cottasoldiers. The seemingly frozen sea wave grain in the stone seems even more magnetic in the light of the florescent tiles. This is clearly the resting place of a figure of some importance.
> 
> At either end of the dais a fountain rises out of the running water, this coincides with [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] of the party into the chamber. This should serve to unnerve the party a bit. The activator panel was under the water and thus rendered indistinct. The pleasant sound of falling water sounds almost musical in the silence of the tomb!
> 
> The Sarcophagus can be opened with relative ease, and within will be found the wrapped body of a woman. The mummy has been [[10 - Resting (D&D 5e SRD)|resting]] undisturbed in this tomb for millenia as is evidenced by the fact that none of the artifacts in the sarcophagus have been disturbed. The linen wrappings are as fresh as if the body was just placed herein. Magic users will be expressing great agitation at this point. The [[Mummy (D&D 5e SRD)|mummy]] is under a very powerful spell of preservation. It is the likes of which they will not have seen.
> 
> On the [[Mummy (D&D 5e SRD)|mummy]]'s hands are 8 rings, each identical, made of the fabulous blue stone of hy-Atlan. These rings are carved in the shapes of elongated versions of the same deamon dogs found on [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] door. The eyes of the dogs on the rings are flawless star saphires, which wink with hidden knowledge.
> 
> The magic-using members of the party will be able to relate that the spell on the [[Mummy (D&D 5e SRD)|mummy]] doesn'textend to the rings which they feel may be removed without affecting the wrapped figure.
> 
> (I've kept out of this melodramatic little piece of overblown sentimentality up to this point out of respect forthe great Trapmeister that Evinrood was, but at this point given the vandalistic streak that most delvers possess, I must intrude. The spell on the recumbent lady will ABSOLUTELY thwart the party's any and every effon to do damage to her physical form. Although she can be moved and searched, she will not come unwrapped and absolutely no physical harm can come to her. That is until Evinrood's spirit has trnly left this plane of existence (HINT!).
> 
> The party will almost certainly talce the rings. From a physical value standpoint the rings are easily worth 2,000 g.p. each (less due to the sudden quantity of hy-Atlantaen stone that will be hitting the market soon.)
> 
> There are magical enhancements on all the rings but the spells are unique and their purposes are hidden from any magical [[Intelligence (D&D 5e SRD)|investigation]], save experimentation. It is at this point that the trap aspect of this room begins to emerge. Eight choices, much to gain, and everything to loose.
> 
> The party will find that while the rings fit well on the.[[Mummy (D&D 5e SRD)|mummy]] they seem to be able to fit the fingers of any member of the party who is looking them over. This is true for the most dainty female [[Elf (D&D 5e SRD)|elf]] or the most hippopotanic oaf of a [[Human (D&D 5e SRD)|human]] warrior. There is one problem, however, these rings will not fit over [[2 - Armor (D&D 5e SRD)|armor]], or gloves.
> 
> The eight rings react as follows.

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> Two of these rings when donned summon [[14 - Monsters (D&D 5e SRD)|elemental]] manifestations known as "Water Dogs" (Water [[14 - Monsters (D&D 5e SRD)|Elemental]]). These creatures will'form out of the fountains on either side of the sarcophagus. They look like animated water in the shape of the oriental temple dogs. The party member will have absolute control of them. They are the size of Great Danes. They can inflict `dice: 25D6` damage. (Their teeth and claws turn to ice for an instant at the point of inflicting damage.) They take only 1/2 damage from normal weapons, even enchanted weapons are halved, unless the enchantment has something to do with fire, heat, or burning, in which case they will take double the damage.

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> One of the rings when donned will turn the bearer into one of the Fabled Tsunami Warriors. The bearer will be able to turn his body into water, this includes his armor, and the ring. (Just to shock the stuffing out of the party have it happen spontaneously the first time, then have the character "pull himself back together". It'll serve to make them less cocky.) This delver will take damage just as the Water Dog described above does. (A further note, being reduced to steam is bad, death through dissipation usually results, and the ring will be lost. Being turned to ice will only slow the delver to a stop. Of course if broken be sure you gather up ALL the pieces, then wait for the thaw.)
> 
> The other five rings, when removed, activate traps.

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The **first** and perhaps simplest is the Ring of Water. When this ring is put on the magic turns the wearer into water, leaving the ring behind. Oops. Care to try again?

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The **second** is the Ring of Desiccation. This ring draws all the water out of a delver. (The mind boggles at the possible effect of these two rings at once!) The delver becomes a leather covered skeleton in an instant.

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> A mechanism within the **third** ring, when withdrawn from the finger of the rightful bearer, causes a tiny sliver of metal to spring free. This sliver is coated with a powerful paralytic poison. The delvercan only be saved by quick administration of an antidote. (Hello, Poison control? I've got a fellow here who has a nasty jab of poison from a thousands of year old mummy's ring ... Hold? What do you mean can I hold?) There is also the possibility of healing magic. (Arrrrgh!)

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The **forth** ring has the same sliver ô€ƒžmechanism, but what it administers is a hallucinogenic drug that slowly induces a heightened paranoiac state. Every two turns there is a 10% chance that the tomb robber who tries this ring will come to believe that the other members of the party are "out to get him" and attack one or all of them. The combat will resolve itself. In this case a magical anti-toxin spell is most likely to have the most beneficial effect. Until the delver attacks the other party members there are no overt signs of the oncoming paranoia. He doesn't want them to know that he knows!

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The **fifth** ring is totally innocuous. At least to the wearer! The trap here will be activated if he extends his hand to another. If he takes a grip of any other persons unarmored hand, or has to grip someones hand to lift them up, a pin will thrust out on the palm side injecting a dose of the paralyzing poison described above.

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> These rings are of variable ratings, from four skulls for the Water or Desiccation rings to two skulls for the paranoia ring.
> 
> Once the rings have been parceled out the party can go on.
