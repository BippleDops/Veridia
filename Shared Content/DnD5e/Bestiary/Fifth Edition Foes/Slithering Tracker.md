## Special Traits
**Amorphous:** A slithering tracker can move through gaps as small as 1 square inch without penalty.

**Engulf:** As an action, a slithering tracker can enter the space of a Medium or smaller paralyzed creature and completely cover it with a thin, transparent film. The engulfed creature loses 1 point of Constitution every 5 minutes. The creature dies if its Constitution drops to 0. If a slithering tracker is attacked while it is engulfing a victim, damage is split evenly between the slithering tracker and the engulfed victim. A slithering tracker cant make melee attacks while it is engulfing a creature.

**Transparent:** A slithering tracker is hard to spot even under ideal conditions. Spotting one that is sitting still takes a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. The creature is spotted automatically if it moves, attacks, or is engulfing someone. Creatures that blunder into an unseen slithering tracker are automatically hit by its slam attack.

## Actions
**Slam:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (`dice: 2d6+2`) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for `dice: 1d4` hours.
