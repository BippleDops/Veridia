# Ancient Curse (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *9th-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
You touch an altar, shrine, icon, the gate of a cemetery, or other object that is dedicated to your god. If this object is desecrated, then this spell is triggered and the person or people who committed the desecration is cursed. The curse can take any form; the following are the more common:

♦ Choose one ability score. While curs-ed, the target’s score is reduced by 1d4 and the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.

♦ The target is haunted by poltergeist (*Monster Manual,* pg,27.)

♦ The target is haunted by ill luck. It has disadvantage three times per day on any important roll (DM’s discretion).

♦ The target is prone to mishap. A roll of 1-5 counts as a critical failure.

♦ The target gains a degenerative disease. Every month, one of its attributes is reduced by 1 and its hit point total is reduced by 1d6.

♦ The target is easily injured. All attacks made against the target do an extra 1d6 damage.

♦ The target is cursed with poverty. Within 24 hours of gaining 10 gp or more, or gaining property worth 10 gp or more, the target will lose half of it.

The affects are not instantaneous but develop over the course of months to a year.

This spell can be broken by *remove curse* cast by a priest of the same god the target offended. It can also be removed if the target fixes the damage it caused and dedicates itself to serving that god.
