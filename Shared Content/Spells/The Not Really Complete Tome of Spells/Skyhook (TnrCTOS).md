# Skyhook (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a metal fishhook)

**Duration**: 1 hour


## Effects
You create a solid hook of force that hovers immovably in midair. You may choose to make the hook visible or invisible to everyone else but you.

The hook can support up to 30 tons of weight and can be used as a handhold or as the base of a pulley system. It is too small to be stood on, but it can hold the ropes that hold a platform. The hook cannot be harmed, although flying creatures that collide with it take 1d8 bludgeoning damage.
