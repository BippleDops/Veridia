--- # Appendix B: Spells

*Source: Princes of the Apocalypse, p. 230* This appendix presents new spells that you can make available to your players. Some of the spells are used by creatures in chapter 7. It's up to you whether these spells are available at character creation, whether they are discovered over the course of the adventure, or whether they don't end up in the characters' hands at all. Many players are fine sticking with the spells in the *Player's Handbook*, whereas other players will be excited to gain new spell options. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Spell Descriptions The spells are presented in alphabetical order. - [[Abi Dalzims Horrid Wilting Xge]] - [[absorb-elements-xge (spells)]] - [[Aganazzars Scorcher Xge]] - [[beast]] - [[Bones of the Earth Xge]] - [[catapult-xge (spells)]] - [[Control Flames Xge]] - [[Control Winds Xge]] - [[Create Bonfire Xge]] - [[dust-devil-xge (spells)]] - [[Earth Tremor Xge]] - [[Earthbind Xge]] - [[elemental-bane-xge (spells)]] - [[erupting-earth-xge (spells)]] - [[flame-arrows-xge (spells)]] - [[frostbite-xge (spells)]] - [[gust-xge (spells)]] - [[ice-knife-xphb (spells)]] - [[Immolation Xge]] - [[Investiture of Flame Xge]] - [[Investiture of Ice Xge]] - [[Investiture of Stone Xge]] - [[Investiture of Wind Xge]] - [[maelstrom-xge (spells)]] - [[Magic Stone Xge]] - [[maximilians-earthen-grasp-xge (spells)]] - [[melfs-minute-meteors-xge (spells)]] - [[mold-earth-xge (spells)]] - [[Primordial Ward Xge]] - [[pyrotechnics-xge (spells)]] - [[Shape Water Xge]] - [[Skywrite Xge]] - [[snillocs-snowball-swarm-xge (spells)]] - [[Storm Sphere Xge]] - [[Thunderclap Xphb]] - [[tidal-wave-xge (spells)]] - [[Transmute Rock Xge]] - [[vitriolic-sphere-xphb (spells)]] - [[Wall of Sand Xge]] - [[Wall of Water Xge]] - [[warding-wind-xge (spells)]] - [[watery-sphere-xge (spells)]] - [[Whirlwind Xge]] ## Player-Facing Summary 09 appendix b spells is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of 09 appendix b spells as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around 09 appendix b spells. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Covenant - Control trade routes ## Plot Hooks - Someone is searching for a witness for love
