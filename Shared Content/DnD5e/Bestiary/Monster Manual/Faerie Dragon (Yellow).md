## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting.*** The dragon's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). It can innately cast a number of spells, requiring no material components:
1/day each: *color spray, dancing lights, mage hand, minor illusion, mirror image*

***Superior Invisibility.*** As a bonus action, the dragon can magically turn invisible until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the dragon wears or carries is invisible with it.

***Limited Telepathy.*** Using telepathy, the dragon can magically communicate with any other [[Faerie Dragon|faerie dragon]] within 60 feet of it.

***Magic Resistance.*** The [[Faerie Dragon|faerie dragon]] has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions
***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 1 piercing damage.

***Euphoria Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The dragon exhales a puff of euphoria gas at one creature within 5 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, or for 1 minute, the target can't take reactions and must roll a `dice: d6` at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior during the turn:

**1-4.** The target takes no action or bonus action and uses all of its movement to move in a random direction.

**5-6.** The target doesn't move, and the only thing it can do on its turn is make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.
