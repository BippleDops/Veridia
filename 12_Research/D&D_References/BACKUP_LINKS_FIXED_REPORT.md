### User Experience Improved
- No more "File not found" errors

## 🛡️ Prevention Measures

### Future Protection
1. **Never move files to backups/** - Use archive folders instead
2. **Run link validation** after major reorganizations
3. **Use safe move scripts** that update links automatically
4. **Create backups as zips** to prevent accidental linking

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check for broken backup links
grep -r "vault_backup_" --include="*.md" . | wc -l

# Verify link integrity
