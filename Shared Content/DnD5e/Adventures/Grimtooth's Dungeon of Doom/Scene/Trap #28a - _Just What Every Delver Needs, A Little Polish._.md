# Trap #28a - "Just What Every Delver Needs, A Little Polish."
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The doors at the end of the hall are the standard double doors, fesatureless excet for three-hole lock mechanism. They are 10 feet tall and 10 feet wide. With the crushed crystal warriors at their back the party will likely feel that the doors are their only problem.
> 
> The doors are unlocked by the usual method, either a low level magical spell, or by "probing" the holes for the right one. When the locking mechanism is tripped is when the fun begins again.
> 
> The first noticeable reaction to the unlocking of the doors is that the floor of the room the party is in splits down the middle, dumping the party and the crushed crystal warriors into a chamber 30 feet below the main hall. This chamber has a rounded bottom and is 50 feet long by 20 feet in diameter. Once the tomb traipsers land in the chamber the weight of their fall causes doors over their heads to close and lock in place. This will effectively create a 50 long cylinderical can inside which are the party, and several hundred pounds of crusfoheodt crystal.
> 
> A quick thinking wizard may fly himself out of this trap by not allowing himself to fal1 but most other delvers should be trapped by this. If you are feeling sporting you can give them a 40% chance (L6) to evade the trap if the delver can come up with a way to stay up, and acts on it.
> 
> door is opened near the end of the giant can. This door is at the end of a tunnel that leads back to the underground river. The purpose of this water shaft is to tum a large water wheel at the greatest possible velocity. The water wheel is joined to the end of the trap can by a series of geared wheels (Evinrood' s design, dwarvish manufacture.) The trapped delvers are in no position to appreciate this marvel of manufactured genius, but they are uniquely placed to enjoy its effects.
> 
> As the water briongs the wheel up to speed the gears will turn the entire cylinder mechanism at an increasing rate. The cylinder's far end is anchored by a large axle that allows this turning to proceed smoothly. The party inside the can will be subjected to the exact same treatment that is used to polish gem stones smooth. The crushed crystal, and the buffeting turning as the speed picks up will be sufficient to take the edge off even the most uncouth, loutish warrior. (If you want comic relief you can have the speed increase slowly enough that for a short period of time delvers who are sufficiently agile can run in the direction of the spin. Of course the river is tireless, the same can seldom be said for the average dungeon delver.
> 
> Once the tomb robbing party has gotten out of the Tumbler Trap (and believe me a party eventually will, in some devious and destructive manner.) They will find that the 20 foot wide doors have been released. (One or the other of the opening trap components also releases the doors, I forget which, perhaps the one that turns on the water?) The party will be confronted by a "T" intersection. To the right and left are 10-foot wide doors. (There is also a secret panel but for reasons that will become obvious we are saving this for last. The party is being offered two perfectly obvious alternatives, why would they look for a third?)
> 
> The polisher is a four skull trap for artistic value as well as torturous intent. The one - two, phased set up wasn't bad either.
> 
> If the party elects to go to the right proceed to the next trap. If the party elects to go to the left then go to Trap #44 and run things backward to this point!
> 
> If by some tragic mischance the party detects the secret door, then go to Done Too Soon. (With any luck they'll get there none too soon.)
