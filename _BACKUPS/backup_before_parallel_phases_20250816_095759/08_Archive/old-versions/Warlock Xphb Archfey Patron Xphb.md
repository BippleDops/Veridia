When you choose this subclass, you might make a deal with an archfey, such as the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and [[darkness-xphb (variant-rules), ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; or an ancient hag. Or you might call on a spectrum of Fey, weaving a web of favors and debts. Whoever they are, your patron is often inscrutable and whimsical. ### Archfey Spells (Level 3) The magic of your patron ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Warlock level specified in the Archfey Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared. **Archfey Spells** | Warlock Level | Spells |

|---------------|--------|
| 3 | [Calm Emotions Xphb]], [[faerie-fire-xphb (spells), [Misty Step Xphb]], [[Phantasmal Force Xphb, [Sleep Xphb]] |
| 5 | [[Blink Xphb, [Plant Growth Xphb]] |
| 7 | [[beast, [Invisibility Xphb]] |
| 9 | [[Dominate Person Xphb, [Seeming Xphb]] |

^archfey-spells ### Steps of the Fey (Level 3) Your patron grants you the ability to move between the boundaries of the planes. You can cast [[Misty Step Xphb without expending a spell slot a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [long-rest-xphb]]. In addition, whenever you cast that spell, you can choose one of the following additional effects. #### Refreshing Step Immediately after you teleport, you or one creature you can see within 10 feet of yourself gains`d10`[[temporary-hit-points-xphb (variant-rules). #### Taunting Step Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or have [Advantage Xphb]] on attack rolls against creatures other than you until the start of your next turn. ### Misty Escape (Level 6) You can cast [[Misty Step Xphb as a [reaction-xphb (variant-rules)]] in response to taking damage. In addition, the following effects are now among your Steps of the Fey options. #### Disappearing Step You have the [[conditions#Invisible|Invisible condition until the start of your next turn or until immediately after you make an attack roll, deal damage, or cast a spell. #### Dreadful Step Creatures within 5 feet of the space you left or the space you appear in (your choice) must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or take``dice: 2d10``Psychic damage. ### Beguiling Defenses (Level 10) Your patron teaches you how to guard your mind and body. You are immune to the [conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] condition. In addition, immediately after a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can take a [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules) to reduce the damage you take by half (round down), and you can force the attacker to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the attacker takes Psychic damage equal to the damage you take. Once you use this [reaction-xphb (variant-rules)]], you can't use it again until you finish a [[long-rest-xphb unless you expend a Pact Magic spell slot (no action required) to restore your use of it. ### Bewitching Magic (Level 14) Your patron grants you the ability to weave your magic with teleportation. Immediately after you cast an Enchantment or Illusion spell using an action and a spell slot, you can cast [Misty Step Xphb]] as part of the same action and without expending a spell slot. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Warlock xphb archfey patron xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
