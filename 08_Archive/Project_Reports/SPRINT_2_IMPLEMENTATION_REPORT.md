## 📊 Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions

**Lean/Agile Principles Applied**:
- ✅ Simple HTTP-based communication over complex WebSocket infrastructure
- ✅ JSON file storage for rapid prototyping and easy debugging
- ✅ Modular design allows independent feature usage
- ✅ Platform-agnostic export formats for maximum VTT compatibility
- ✅ Progressive enhancement from basic to advanced functionality

**Integration Architecture**:
```
Role-Based Permissions ←→ Session Broadcasting
         ↓                        ↓
    Content Filtering    ←→   User Management
         ↓                        ↓
    VTT Export System   ←→   Activity Tracking
```

**Data Flow**:
- User authenticates via Permissions system
- Session Broadcasting tracks user activity and content access
- VTT Integration respects permission rules for export filtering
- All systems share common user identity and role information
