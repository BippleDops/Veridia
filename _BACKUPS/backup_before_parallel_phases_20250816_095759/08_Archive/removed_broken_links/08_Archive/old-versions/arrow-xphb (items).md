*Ammunition* - **Cost**: 5 cp
- **Weight**: 0.05 lbs. Arrows are used with a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield. Arrows are typically stored in a [[Swift Quiver Xphb]] (bought separately). *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 222.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of arrow xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around arrow xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Shadow Covenant - Achieve immortality ## Plot Hooks - Strange accidents suggest a conspiracy
