With their fearsome claws, crushing horns, and fiery breath, chimeras are tempests of ferocity, driven by their three heads' conflicting instincts. Their heads agree on little but their desires to feed and to drive competitors from the rugged territories where these monsters make their lairs. When they spot prey, chimeras typically strafe foes with their fire breath before landing to attack with their fangs, horns, and claws. Owing to their draconic instincts, chimeras are greedy creatures that hoard treasures within cavernous lairs. They're undiscerning about what they collect, gathering shiny objects alongside trophies and bones from their recent kills. Brave souls seeking to distract or temporarily appease a chimera can do so by offering it treasure and food.```statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of chimera xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around chimera xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [chimera-xmm (monstrosity)]]
