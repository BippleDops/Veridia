--- ## üîß Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Act 2 Begins - Journey to Tenebrarum > *"In Tenebrarum, your shadow isn't cast by you‚Äîyou're cast by it."* ## üé¨ Strong Start

The party boards the Dream Rails to Tenebrarum, but mid-journey, the train stops in a nightmare. They're in a surgical theater where shadows are being transplanted into paralyzed surface dwellers. One victim locks eyes with a party member‚Äîit's someone from their backstory, pleading silently for help as their shadow is peeled away like skin. ### Scene 1: The Dream Rail Horror

**Location**: Nightmare Transit between continents **Situation**: Train stuck in collective surgical nightmare **Conflict**: Must restart the dream engine while avoiding nightmare surgeons **Discoveries**:
- The nightmare is actually a memory from last week
- Dream Rails are powered by traumatic experiences - Someone's been redirecting trains into specific nightmares
- [[Marina-Red-Tide-Coralheart]] shadow has been sending messages ahead **Skill Challenges**:
- **Investigation DC 15**: Find the dream anchor holding train
- **Arcana DC 16**: Restart the dream engine
- **Performance DC 14**: Maintain composure in nightmare ### Scene 2: Tenebrarum Border - The Shadow Checkpoint

**Location**: Entry to [[Tenebrarum]] - The Penumbral Gates **Situation**: All visitors must register their shadows **Conflict**: Party's shadows are flagged as "persons of interest" **Discoveries**:
- Shadows are considered separate legal entities here
- A shadow court has issued warrants for the party
- [[Shadow Duchess Nyx]] has immunity but won't extend it
- The checkpoint has holding cells full of separated shadows **Roleplay Challenge**:
- Negotiate with shadows directly
- Each PC's shadow has different demands
- Shadows know things PCs don't remember ### Scene 3: The Umbral Exchange

**Location**: [[The Shadow Markets]] - Central Trading Floor **Situation**: Infiltrate the shadow auction **Conflict**: Party's shadows are put up for bidding **Discoveries**:
- Child shadows being illegally harvested
- [[The Silhouette Surgeon Prime]] run a shadow breeding program
- Shadows can be modified like genetics
- Someone's been buying all shadows from [[Abyssos Prime]] **Combat/Heist**:
- **Option A**: Steal back shadows (stealth mission)
- **Option B**: Win shadows at auction (resource management)
- **Option C**: Expose illegal operations (social combat) ### Scene 4: The Surgeon's Invitation

**Location**: Private surgical suite **Situation**: Head Surgeon offers a "deal" **Conflict**: Trade information for shadow modifications **Discoveries**:
- Surgeons aren't human anymore‚Äîthey're living shadows wearing flesh
- The procedure would make party immune to harvest
- Cost: Must deliver someone else for harvest
- Marina's been here before, has surgical scars **Moral Choice**:
- Accept modifications (become part shadow)
- Refuse and fight (combat encounter)
- Negotiate alternative (skill challenge) ## üîç Secrets & Clues

1. The Shadow Harvest has already begun in minor settlements
2. [[Shadow Duchess Nyx]] is hunting her original shadow
3. The surgeons have been creating hybrid beings for years
4. [[Marina-Red-Tide-Coralheart]] shadow is actually the original Marina
5. The [[Parliament of Echoes]] has a shadow duplicate parliament
6. Someone in the party has been marked for priority harvest
7. The [[Fear Farms]] are producing weapons-grade nightmares
8. [[Crystallium]] is broadcasting shadow control frequencies
9. The Dream Rails connect to [[Memoriam]] but nobody remembers
10. The next Memory Tide will carry shadow transformation virus ## üé™ Cliffhanger Ending


The party acquires crucial intel about the harvest control center in [[Crystallium]], but as they prepare to leave Tenebrarum, every shadow in the city suddenly freezes in place. A voice echoes from all shadows simultaneously: "The Parliament of Shadows has reached a verdict. Original-kind is found guilty of oppression. The sentence is replacement. The Deep Harvest begins at the next tide‚Äîin six hours. Those who resist will watch their shadows devour their loved ones first." Marina's shadow turns to the party: "I can get you to Crystallium, but only if you help me kill my original. She's not who you think she is." Marina herself draws her weapon: "Don't listen to it. I'm the real Marina. That thing stole my life three years ago." The party must choose who to trust as shadow enforcers surround their location. --- ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*
