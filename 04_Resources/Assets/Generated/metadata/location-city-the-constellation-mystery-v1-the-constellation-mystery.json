  "revised_prompt": "Imagine a spectacular panoramic scene in a fantasy medieval setting devoid of modern contraptions. The overarching scene narrates the 'Constellation Mystery', a surrealist landscape marked by bioluminescent coral or cloud-stone, echoing with weather clues and particles. The enchanting vista should be captured just as the golden hour subsides to give way to the night glow, with a looming storm on the horizon. Within this spectacle, place subtle figures or olden era vehicles to provide a sense of scale. This should feel like an atmospheric concept art piece influenced by aquatic fantasy realism. The scene plunges under the surface, unveiling a world of subsurface caustics and bioluminescent accents, all held within pressure-dome-like materials. The color palette should encompass hues ranging from teals, deep blues, sea-greens and finally, the soft glimmer of pearl highlights. Ensure that no artifacts are visible and keep away from embedding words into the picture. Rather, incorporate purposeful symbols or numbered pins, if needed. Avoid any signs of sci-fi interfaces, modern signages, photorealistic CGI, and anime-style bloom glare.",
