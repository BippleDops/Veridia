--- # Aethermoor Sky Navigation Chart - Player Handout *Essential guide for aerial travel and weather navigation in Aethermoor* ### Major Air Highways

**The Great Spiral** (Altitude: 8,000-12,000 feet)
- Primary trade route connecting all major cities
- Wind speed: 25-40 mph consistent eastward flow
- Weather: Generally stable, moderate turbulence
- Travel time: Capital to outlying cities 2-4 days **The Storm Track** (Altitude: 15,000-20,000 feet) - High-speed route for urgent travel
- Wind speed: 60-100 mph, highly variable
- Weather: Frequent electrical storms, dangerous conditions
- Travel time: Cross-continent in 1-2 days (experienced pilots only) **The Calm Channels** (Altitude: 3,000-6,000 feet)
- Gentle winds suitable for novice pilots
- Wind speed: 10-20 mph, predictable patterns
- Weather: Mild conditions, occasional fog
- Travel time: Leisurely travel, 5-7 days between major cities ### Seasonal Wind Patterns

**Storm Season (Months 3-5)**
- Violent weather systems, 50% higher wind speeds
- Lightning storms common above 10,000 feet
- Recommended maximum altitude: 8,000 feet
- Emergency shelters operational at all waypoints **Wind Season (Months 6-8)** - Optimal flying conditions, steady predictable winds
- Clear skies, excellent visibility
- All altitude levels safe for travel
- Peak trade and transport activity **Calm Season (Months 9-11)**
- Light winds, longer travel times
- Excellent for sightseeing and training
- Risk of sudden weather changes
- Backup propulsion systems recommended **Storm Return (Months 12-2)**
- Building weather intensity
- Unpredictable wind shears and pressure changes
- Close monitoring of weather reports essential
- Avoid travel above 12,000 feet ### Breathing and Pressure Zones

**Surface Level (0-2,000 feet)**
- Normal breathing, no special equipment needed
- Standard atmospheric pressure
- Risk level: Minimal **Low Altitude (2,000-8,000 feet)**
- Slight breathing difficulty, warm clothing recommended
- Minor pressure changes
- Risk level: Low **High Altitude (8,000-15,000 feet)**
- Breathing apparatus recommended for extended exposure
- Significant pressure changes, ear protection advised
- Risk level: Moderate **Extreme Altitude (15,000+ feet)**
- Oxygen apparatus mandatory
- Severe pressure effects, specialized gear required
- Risk level: High (Experienced pilots only) ### Natural Features

**The Crystal Peaks** (Northern Region)
- Massive crystal formations visible from 50+ miles
- Distinctive rainbow light refraction patterns
- Navigation bearing: True North reference point
- Warning: Strong magnetic interference affects compasses **The Floating Isles** (Central Region)
- Chain of seven major sky islands
- Each island has unique shape and vegetation
- Navigation aid: Numbered lighthouse system
- Warning: Unpredictable air currents between islands **The Storm Wall** (Western Border)
- Permanent weather barrier, 300+ mile length
- Distinctive purple-black cloud formation
- Navigation warning: Absolute no-fly zone
- Emergency: If caught in storm, descend immediately **The Wind Garden** (Southern Region)
- Perpetual aurora-like light display
- Caused by interaction of wind and crystal dust
- Navigation aid: Visible patterns indicate wind direction
- Cultural note: Sacred site, respectful overflights only ### Artificial Landmarks

**Sky Beacon Network**
- 47 lighthouse towers across Aethermoor
- Light patterns indicate local weather and wind conditions
- Standard signals shown in appendix
- Maintained by Royal Navigation Service **Port Towers**
- Major cities have distinctive spire designs
- Color-coded landing guidance systems
- Radio communication frequencies listed below
- Emergency frequencies always monitored ### Signal Classifications

**Green Pent**: Ideal flying conditions
- Clear skies, gentle winds, good visibility
- All aircraft types approved for flight
- No special precautions necessary **Yellow Pent**: Caution advised
- Moderate winds or limited visibility
- Small aircraft should consider postponing travel
- Monitor weather updates frequently **Red Pent**: Dangerous conditions - High winds, storms, or severe weather
- Only emergency flights authorized
- Master pilot certification required **Black Pent**: No-fly emergency
- Extreme weather phenomena
- All aircraft grounded immediately
- Seek immediate shelter ### Emergency Weather Phenomena

**Wind Shears**
- Sudden changes in wind direction/speed
- Can flip or damage aircraft instantly
- Warning signs: Rapid pressure changes, unusual cloud formations
- Response: Immediate altitude change, avoid affected zone **Lightning Storms**
- Concentrated electrical activity
- Risk of aircraft electrical damage
- Warning signs: Static charge buildup, metal objects humming
- Response: Land immediately, wait for storm to pass **Reality Storms**
- Dimensional instability affecting local weather
- Unpredictable effects on physics and magic
- Warning signs: Impossible cloud shapes, gravity fluctuations
- Response: Evacuate area, report to Reality Corps ### Emergency Signals

**Mayday Call**: Immediate life-threatening emergency
- Repeat "Mayday" three times
- State aircraft type and location
- Describe nature of emergency
- Follow instructions from response teams **Pan-Pan Call**: Urgent situation but not immediate danger
- State "Pan-Pan" three times
- Provide aircraft details and situation
- Request assistance or priority handling ### Forced Landing Checklist

1. **Maintain Control**: Keep aircraft stable
2. **Choose Landing Site**: Avoid populated areas
3. **Send Distress Signal**: Use radio or visual signals
4. **Prepare Passengers**: Secure loose objects, brace position
5. **Execute Landing**: Follow aircraft-specific procedures
6. **Post-Landing**: Check for injuries, signal rescue teams ### Lost Navigation Recovery


1. **Maintain Current Heading**: Don't make random turns
2. **Climb for Visibility**: Gain altitude to see landmarks
3. **Use Backup Navigation**: Magnetic compass, star positions
4. **Contact Ground**: Request position assistance
5. **Follow Major Airways**: Head toward known wind currents
6. **Land if Necessary**: Better to land safely than risk fuel exhaustion --- **Pilot's Creed**: *"Respect the sky, trust your training, and never fly beyond your limits."* **Emergency Contact**: Sky Rescue Service operates 24/7 on emergency frequency 121.5 MHz --- *Issued by the Royal Aethermoor Navigation Authority in cooperation with the Sky Pilots Guild.
