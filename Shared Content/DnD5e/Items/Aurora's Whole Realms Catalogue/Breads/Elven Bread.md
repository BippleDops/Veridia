## Description
Another coup for my catalog! Shipped direct from the legendary Isle of Evermeet, this is the lightest, sweetest, finest-grained bread you will ever taste. Tales are told of its extraordinary nutritional values, none of which I can confirm or deny, naturally. Some even say a secret cache of its been keeping Elminster going these years! I, on the contrary, can only promise your taste buds a delightful sensation with every bite! Elven bread: 2 gp/loaf.

## Additional Details
nutritional values, indeed! This bread acts as double-strength iron rations, providing twice the food value with half the weight (and many times more taste!)
