# Memory Trader

*"Experiences are currency, memories are treasures, and I deal in the rarest of both."*

## Overview
Memory Traders are specialized merchants who deal in the buying, selling, and exchange of actual memories extracted from willing (and sometimes unwilling) participants. Using a combination of magical techniques and specialized equipment, these traders can remove, preserve, duplicate, and implant memories, creating a unique form of commerce that exists in the shadowy areas between legal trade and illicit activity.

## Historical Background
Memory trading emerged as dimensional barriers weakened, allowing new forms of magical manipulation previously impossible. The practice spread rapidly through both realms as demand grew for unique experiences, specialized knowledge, and the ability to forget traumatic events.

## Current State
Memory trading now operates through established networks with codes of conduct and quality standards. However, the practice remains controversial and is heavily regulated in most areas due to ethical concerns and potential for abuse.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
- Specialized memory extraction/implantation equipment
- Magical aptitude for mind-based spells
- Preservation containers for storing memories
- Network connections for finding buyers/sellers

### Effects
- **Memory Purchase**: Gain experiences or knowledge without living them
- **Memory Sale**: Remove unwanted or traumatic memories for profit
- **Skill Transfer**: Acquire abilities through memory implantation
- **Information Gathering**: Purchase memories containing secrets

### Duration
Memory transactions typically permanent unless reversed through specialized procedures.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Stolen Memories**: Characters must recover their memories from illegal traders
2. **Memory Detective**: Investigate crimes using purchased witness memories
3. **Identity Crisis**: Someone's personality changes after memory implantation

## Campaign Use
Provides unique roleplaying opportunities and moral dilemmas around identity, experience, and consciousness.
