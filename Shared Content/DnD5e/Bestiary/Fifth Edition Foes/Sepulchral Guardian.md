## Special Traits
**Crypt Fatigue:** A creature infected with crypt fatigue gains one level of exhaustion immediately, and gains one more level every time it fails the DC 12 Constitution saving throw after taking damage from a sepulchral guardian. An infected creature must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw at the end of every long rest; with a successful save, it recovers from one level of exhaustion, but with a failed save, it gains one level of exhaustion. The disease is cured when the victim no longer has any levels of exhaustion.

**Dread:** Living creatures with line of sight to one or more sepulchral guardians and within 50 feet of them must make a successful DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for `dice: 2d4` rounds. A successful save renders the target immune to any guardians dread for 24 hours.

## Actions

## Description
Sepulchral guardians are constructs created from the preserved corpses of dead humanoids that have been encased in iron. They are created for one purpose only: to guard the final resting place of a dead creature. Once activated, a sepulchral guardian performs its task until it is destroyed. Even the death of its creator does not disrupt a sepulchral guardian: many are created to guard the final resting places of their creators.

A sepulchral guardian appears as a humanoid standing just over 6 feet tall. Its entire body except for its face is encased in a suit of banded iron. Its face, while humanoid, shows no sign of life, and its eyes are filled with the emptiness of an automaton. Most sepulchral guardians wield glaives or halberds, and the touch of the weapon transmits a wasting disease from the guardian into the target of the attack. When creatures are affected by a sepulchral guardian’s dread, the guardian tries to corner the victim so it can attack from 10 feet away with its pole weapon while the frightened creature cowers under the blows, unable to get close enough to use its weapons. These constructs are intelligent enough to pursue an intruder through nearby corridors and chambers of a tomb, but they seldom leave the immediate structure they’ve been set to guard, even to chase down a thief who stole something.

Sepulchral guardians can’t speak; they are incapable of uttering any sound, but their armor scrapes and grinds loudly when they move. As they stand perfectly still on guard, however, they are also perfectly silent.

A sepulchral guardian’ body is constructed from 500 pounds of iron mixed with rare chemicals totaling 1,000 gp and fashioned into armor that is fused to the preserved corpse of a humanoid.
