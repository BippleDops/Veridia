With their great size and chilling breath, winter wolves pursue megafauna, arctic travelers, and any other creatures they catch on the tundra. Winter wolves are more intelligent than natural wolves and can speak. Most are predomitly concerned with their next meal, and while they might converse with other creatures in exchange for food, few concern themselves with long-term bargains or keeping their word unless they have something to gain. Winter wolves often hunt alongside frost giants that indulge them with frequent hunts and reliable meals. > [!quote] A quote from Koran, Winter Wolf > > Snowdrifts, driving hail, and wind fierce enough to strip the hairless skin off your bones—you lot have been through it all. But good news, there's a town full of warm hearths right over this rise.

> You'll never reach it, but at least your last thoughts will be warm.```statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of winter wolf xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around winter wolf xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
