| **d20** | **Result** |
|---|---|
| 1-5 | *Failure*. The creature is horribly defec-tive or mutated in some way. It may be stillborn, it might die shortly after birth, or it might survive to adulthood—in which case it will always breed true, and it may have gained unforseen abilities. |
| 6-9 | *Failure*. There is a 50% chance that it will pass on the trait to its offspring, however. |
| 10-18 | *Success*. There is a 50% chance that it will not pass the trait on to its offspring, however. |
| 19-20 | *Complete success*. The creature will al-ways breed true. |
