# Snapdragon (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a snapdragon blos-som)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You pick a point within range. All flowering plants within 20 feet of that point temporarily awaken and become carnivorous. A creature that ends its turn within that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 4d6 piercing damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.

The animated flowers also spit pollen. This causes disabling sneezing and choking while in that area. All creatures have their movement reduced to 10 feet.
