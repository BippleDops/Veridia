An encounter is a scene in an adventure that is part of at least one of the game's three pillars: social interaction, exploration, or combat.

## Adventure Hooks

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
