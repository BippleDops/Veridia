# The Sunken Markets

## Overview
Beneath [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]]'s harbor lies an otherworldly marketplace that exists half-submerged, where air-breathing merchants trade with denizens of the deep. Discovered only two years ago when the Crimson Shard's placement in the harbor caused tidal anomalies, the Sunken Markets have become a crucial but dangerous connection point between Aethermoor and [[Aquabyssos]].

## Structure
The Markets occupy a series of partially flooded caves and ruins that predate the current city:

### The Breathing Halls
- Massive air pockets maintained by ancient enchantments
- Crystalline formations that purify air and water
- Stone walkways that rise and fall with the tides
- Bioluminescent coral providing eerie illumination

### The Exchange Pools
- Circular pools where surface and aquatic traders meet
- Water enchanted to allow air-breathers to submerge safely for limited periods
- Translation crystals that convert speech between air and water
- Neutral territory enforced by both surface and deep guards

### The Depth Vaults
- Ancient storage chambers recently excavated
- Some flooded, some dry, some shifting between states
- Contains pre-Shattering artifacts and forgotten trade goods
- Heavily guarded by mysterious constructs

### The Tidal Gates
- Four massive portals that open at specific tide times
- Connect to different underwater locations
- Northern Gate: [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Shadowmere]]'s Lake Gloom
- Eastern Gate: Deep ocean trenches
- Southern Gate: [[Aquabyssos]] outer territories
- Western Gate: Status unknown (sealed)

## Inhabitants & Traders

### Regular Merchants
- **Brine Merchants:** Selling preserved goods that never spoil
- **Pearl Divers Guild:** Offering deep pearls with magical properties
- **Coral Shapers:** Creating living armor and weapons

### From the Depths

2. All trades must be witnessed by a Depth Speaker
3. Blood debts carry over between surface and deep
4. Certain names must not be spoken (invoke deep curses)
5. Iron weapons forbidden (rust corrupts the waters)

## DM Notes
The Sunken Markets serve as the primary interface between the surface world and Aquabyssos, allowing introduction of underwater elements without requiring full aquatic adventures. The location's mix of commerce and danger provides opportunities for social encounters, investigation, and combat. The various factions present create natural conflict and alliance opportunities. The ancient nature of the site connects to the deeper mysteries of both the Seven Shards and the origins of the crystal corruption.
