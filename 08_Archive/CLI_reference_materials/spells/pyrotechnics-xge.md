# Pyrotechnics
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Choose an area of nonmagical flame that you can see and that fits within a 5-foot cube within range. You can extinguish the fire in that area, and you create either fireworks or smoke when you do so.

## Fireworks

The target explodes with a dazzling display of colors. Each creature within 10 feet of the target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become [blinded](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Blinded) until the end of your next turn.

## Smoke

Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.

## Player-Facing Summary

Pyrotechnics xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of pyrotechnics xge as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around pyrotechnics xge.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties pyrotechnics xge to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at pyrotechnics xge to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to pyrotechnics xge active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
