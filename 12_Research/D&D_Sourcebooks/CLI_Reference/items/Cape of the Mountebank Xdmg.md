--- # Cape of the Mountebank

*Wondrous item, rare* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/cape-of-the-mountebank.webp#right) This cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast [[Dimension Door Xphb]] as a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action. This property can't be used again until the next dawn. When you teleport with that spell, you leave behind a cloud of smoke. The space you left is [[lightly-obscured-xphb (variant-rules)]] by that smoke until the end of your next turn. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 242.
