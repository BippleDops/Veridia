# Giant Insect
*4th-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You summon a giant centipede, spider, or wasp (chosen when you cast the spell). It manifests in an unoccupied space you can see within range and uses the [Giant Insect](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/giant-insect-xphb.md) stat block. The form you choose determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your [Initiative](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [Dodge](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Dodge) action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.

**Classes**: [Druid](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
