# Wyvern Watch (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 12 hours


## Effects
You create a cloud of mauve smoke in roughly the shape of a wyvern, which you set to guard an area. If a creature of Small size or larger approaches within 10 feet, the wyvern strikes and the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute.

As soon as a creature has succumbed to the wyvernâ€™s attack, or when 12 hours has passed, the wyvern will dissipate.
