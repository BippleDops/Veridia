# Grease
Slick grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into {@quickref difficult terrain||3} for the duration.

When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall [[prone]]. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall [[prone]].
