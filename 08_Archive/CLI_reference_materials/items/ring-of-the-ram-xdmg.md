# Ring of the Ram
*Ring, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/ring-of-the-ram.webp#right)


This ring has 3 charges and regains `d3` expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can take a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to expend 1 to 3 charges to make a ranged spell attack against one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The ring produces a spectral ram's head and makes its attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes `2d10` Force damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.

Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring's charges as a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to try to break a nonmagical object you can see within 60 feet of yourself that isn't being worn or carried. The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each charge you spend.
