# Abyssos Prime - The Drowned Throne

## Overview
The former capital of the surface empire of Thalassopolis, now a haunted metropolis of coral-covered spires and bioluminescent decay. The city exists in multiple phases of reality simultaneously - visitors might walk through a grand ballroom only to find themselves in its ruined future or glorious past. Buildings drift between solid and liquid states, and gravity follows emotional rather than physical laws.

The city pulses with the paranoid consciousness of the Eternal Emperor Malachus, whose mind is scattered across millions of sea creatures. Every fish might be his eye, every eel his voice. This creates an atmosphere of constant surveillance and whispered madness.

## Geography
### The Inverse Palace Complex
The center of Abyssos Prime defies all natural laws. Water flows upward in crystalline streams, and air bubbles sink like stones. The palace exists in three dimensions simultaneously:
- **The Memory**: How it was before drowning (glimpsed in reflections)
- **The Reality**: Current drowned state (physical presence)
- **The Possibility**: What it could become (seen in dreams)

### Districts/Areas
1. **The Throne of Bubbles**: Where the Emperor's primary consciousness resides in electric eels swimming through air
2. **The Gallery of Frozen Waves**: Tsunami waves frozen mid-crash, each containing different time streams
3. **The Screaming Gardens**: Crystallized forests of sound grown from drowning victims' last cries
4. **Parliament District**: Where ghost senators eternally debate laws for no one
5. **The Depth Market**: Underground bazaar trading in souls, memories, and impossibilities
6. **The Inverted Ballroom**: Grand hall where dancers perform on the ceiling, tears falling upward
7. **Memory Meadows**: Kelp fields storing the memories of the drowned

### Notable Landmarks
- **The Shattered Observatory**: Looks up through the ocean to see distorted stars
- **The Fountain of Tears**: Flows upward with the sorrow of the city
- **The Probability Bridge**: Exists only when observed, leads to different destinations each crossing
- **The Echo Amphitheater**: Performances here happen yesterday, today, and tomorrow simultaneously

## Demographics
**Population:** ~2 million transformed souls
- 40% Partially crystallized humans
- 30% Depth-adapted descendants
- 20% Ghost senators and servants (semi-corporeal)
- 10% Unknown entities from the deep

**Primary Race:** Transformed Humans
**Government:** The Eternal Senate (undead parliament) under the Scattered Emperor
**Controlling Faction:** [[The Emperor's Fragments]]

## History
### The Last Day
When the Cascade of Sorrows began, Emperor Malachus attempted to save the capital through a massive magical working. Instead of preventing the flood, he accidentally preserved the moment of drowning itself, trapping the city between life and death.

### The Fragmentation
Realizing his consciousness was too large a target for the entities from below, the Emperor scattered himself across the sea life. Each fragment holds a piece of his memory, personality, and power, making him effectively immortal but irreversibly insane.

### The Eternal Senate
The senators who drowned in session continue to meet, unaware they're dead. Their debates shape reality within the city, their votes becoming physical laws that affect only Abyssos Prime.

## GM Notes
### Atmosphere
- Constant feeling of drowning without dying
- Beautiful horror - elegant decay
- Paranoia from constant surveillance
- Time distortion creates urgency and confusion
