## Overview
An emergency mission where someone important has been displaced in time by magical accident or deliberate action. Players must navigate temporal anomalies, paradoxes, and time-based hazards to rescue the victim before temporal forces strand them permanently.

**Emergency Return**: Emergency evacuation possible but risky

## Mission Parameters
