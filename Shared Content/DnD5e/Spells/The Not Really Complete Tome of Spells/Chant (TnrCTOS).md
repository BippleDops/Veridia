# Chant (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 round

**Range**: Self (30-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
You call upon your deity to grant you and your allies special favor and to curse your foes.

As long as you continue to recite the holy writ, your allies that are within range gain +1 to attack and damage, +1 to AC, and 2d4 temporary hit points, while your enemies have their hit point totals reduced by 2d4. If that reduces their hit point totals to 0, they fall unconscious.

This spell continues for as long as you chant, up to 1 minute. If you take damage, you must make a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to 10 or half the damage you take, whichever is higher) to be able to continue chanting. Likewise, if you are silenced through magical or mundane means, this spell ends.
