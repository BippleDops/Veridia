# Ice Blade (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a shard of ice, glass, or crystal)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
You create a magical, three-foot long sword-shaped formation of jagged, swirling ice shards. You use your spell attack modifier to hit and you strike with advantage, as its unconnected ice-shards can pass through chinks in armor.

On a hit, it inflicts 2d10 slashing damage and 1d12 cold damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th-level or higher, you do an additional 1d12 cold damage for each slot level above 4th.
