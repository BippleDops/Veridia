## Overview
Elder Whisper-In-The-Dark is an ancient triton oracle who was among the first to hear [[The Deep Mother]]'s whispers from the oceanic abyss. Once a respected prophet and spiritual guide, three centuries of exposure to the Deep Mother's influence has transformed her into something between divine oracle and maddened cultist. She speaks truths that shouldn't be known and prophecies that always come to pass, but her words come wrapped in riddles, shadow imagery, and half-mad ravings.

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Voice**: Warm and friendly

**Speech Pattern**: Carefully chosen words

**Physical Habits**: Maintains intense eye contact

## Motivations
1. **Primary**: Serve as conduit for the Deep Mother's will and wisdom
2. **Secondary**: Prevent the total destruction of Aquabyssos through prophetic guidance
3. **Hidden**: Find a way to break her connection while retaining her sanity
4. **Personal**: Protect those few she still considers friends from the coming darkness
5. **Ultimate**: Prepare the world for the Deep Mother's eventual awakening

### Special Abilities
**Deep Mother's Whispers.** The Elder can hear and interpret the Deep Mother's voice. As a bonus action, she can make a DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check to gain advantage on her next spell attack or impose disadvantage on one creature's next saving throw.

**Prophetic Sight.** The Elder automatically succeeds on Initiative rolls and cannot be surprised. She knows the general intent of creatures within 60 feet.

**Truth Compulsion Aura.** Creatures within 30 feet of the Elder must succeed on a DC 19 Charisma save when they attempt to lie, or speak the truth instead.

**Void Touch.** The Elder's touch deals an additional 2d8 necrotic damage and can corrupt objects and creatures.

**Spellcasting.** The Elder is an 18th-level spellcaster. Spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 21, +13 to hit). Known spells:
- Cantrips (at will): *eldritch blast*, *minor illusion*, *prestidigitation*, *thaumaturgy*
- 1st level (4 slots): *charm person*, *detect magic*, *hex*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts*, *hold person*, *suggestion*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell*, *hunger of hadar*, *sending*
- 4th level (3 slots): *confusion*, *divination*, *greater invisibility*
- 5th level (3 slots): *dominate person*, *scrying*, *contact other plane*
- 6th level (1 slot): *mass suggestion*, *true seeing*
- 7th level (1 slot): *plane shift*, *reverse gravity*
- 8th level (1 slot): *feeblemind*, *dominate monster*
- 9th level (1 slot): *foresight*, *wish*

### Actions
**Multiattack.** The Elder makes two Void Touch attacks or casts a spell and makes one attack.

**Void Touch.** *Melee Spell Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d4 + 5) force damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. Target must succeed on DC 21 Constitution save or gain one level of corruption.

**Prophecy of Doom (Recharge 5-6).** The Elder speaks a prophecy of the target's doom. One creature within 60 feet must succeed on DC 21 Wisdom save or take 35 (10d6) psychic damage and be frightened until end of their next turn. If the target fails by 5 or more, they are stunned instead of frightened.

**Summon Deep Horror (1/Day).** The Elder calls forth a horror from the depths. This functions as *summon greater demon* spell, summoning a creature with Deep Mother traits.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **The Dire Prophecy**: She prophesies doom for the party unless they undertake a specific quest
2. **The Truth Seeker**: Party needs information only she possesses about [[The Seven Shards]]
3. **The Corruption Crisis**: Her unique knowledge of shadow corruption makes her essential for a cure
4. **The Deep Mother's Will**: She tasks party with preventing or causing a prophesied event
5. **The Sanity Gambit**: Party must help her break free from the Deep Mother's influence
6. **The Cult Investigation**: Her followers are suspected of terrorist activities
7. **The Ancient Knowledge**: She holds the key to understanding pre-Drowning mysteries

## Secrets & Hidden Knowledge
> [!warning] DM Only
> - Knows the true location of three of [[The Seven Shards]]
> - Has seen visions of [[Duchess Marina Ever-Drowning (D&D_References)]]'s true nature
> - Prophesied the return of [[Emperor Thalassius the Wise]] centuries ago
> - Knows that [[Admiral Thorne Blackwater]] is dying from pressure poisoning
> - Has foreseen a catastrophic war between surface and depths within 5 years
> - The Deep Mother is not evil but is trying to prevent an even greater cosmic threat
> - She maintains a fragment of her original sanity hidden deep in her psyche

## Speaking Style
*"The depths whisper of futures painted in shadow and blood, little surface swimmer. Would you hear them?"*

*"I have seen your death, Admiral. It comes not from the depths you guard against, but from the poison in your own blood. The irony pleases the Dark Mother."*

*"Truth is a weight that crushes the unprepared. Lies are bubbles that rise to the surface. Which do you choose to breathe?"*

*"The Seven Songs will reunite, but not as the ancients intended. Marina dances to music she cannot hear. The Sage weaves fate with threads of starlight and sorrow."*

*(During prophecy trance)* "She rises... she rises... the Deep Mother stirs and the waters will boil with her awakening. The crown that was shattered becomes the chain that binds the depths to the surface... blood in the water... blood in the water..."*

### Lair Actions
On initiative 20 (losing ties), the Elder can take one lair action:
- **Whisper Storm**: All creatures in 60-foot radius must make DC 19 Wisdom save or be confused for 1 round
- **Prophetic Vision**: Force one creature to experience a terrifying vision of their doom (frightened for 1 minute)
- **Shadow Manipulation**: Move through shadows to any point within the lair
- **Deep Mother's Gaze**: All creatures in lair feel watched and must make DC 19 Charisma save or be stunned with cosmic horror

### Regional Effects
The area within 3 miles of the Whispering Chamber has the following effects:
- Prophetic dreams plague sleeping creatures (often accurate but disturbing)
- Shadows appear deeper and seem to move independently
- Truth-telling becomes compulsive in certain areas
- Marine life exhibits unusual intelligence and occasionally speaks
- The water itself seems to carry whispered messages

## Plot Hooks

1. **The Request**: Elder Whisper-In-The-Dark needs assistance with a delicate matter
2. **The Opposition**: Someone wants Elder Whisper-In-The-Dark stopped or removed
3. **The Secret**: Information about Elder Whisper-In-The-Dark's past surfaces
4. **The Alliance**: Opportunity to work with or against Elder Whisper-In-The-Dark
5. **The Crisis**: Elder Whisper-In-The-Dark is caught in a situation requiring intervention

## Notable Quotes

> "Every challenge is an opportunity in disguise."

> "Trust is earned through action, not words."

> "The path forward is rarely the easiest one."
