*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)* These heavy gauntlets of brown iron are forged in the shape of an [[umber-hulk-xmm (monstrosity)]] claws, and they fit the wearer's hands and forearms all the way up to the elbow. While wearing both claws, you gain a burrowing speed of 20 feet, and you can tunnel through solid rock at a rate of 1 foot per round. You can use a claw as a melee weapon while wearing it. You have proficiency with it, and it deals`d8`slashing damage on a hit (your Strength modifier applies to the attack and damage rolls, as normal). While wearing the claws, you can't manipulate objects or cast spells with somatic components. *Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 222* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Claws of the umber hulk pota is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
