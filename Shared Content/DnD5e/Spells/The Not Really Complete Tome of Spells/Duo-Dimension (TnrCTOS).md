# Duo-Dimension (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a likeness of yourself carved out of flat ivory, worth at least 500 gp, which is passed through a strip of parchment twisted into a MÃ¶bius strip)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


## Effects
You become completely two-dimensional, having height and width with no depth. You are completely invisible when turned sideways and can slip through the thinnest of cracks. While you are two-dimensional, you take double damage from piercing and slashing weapons.

For the duration of the spell, your third dimension exists on the Astral Plane. You cannot see or interact with anything on the Astral Plane, but creatures there can see and interact with you, including attacking you. You take normal damage from such attacks.
