Slipping into the homes of sleepers, incubi feed off dreams and replace them with terrifying nightmares. Incubi visit victims nightly until their prey expires. The incubi then hunt for new victims, preferring the loved ones of past targets. Incubi can transform into succubi and vice versa, taking the forms they need to manipulate foes in dreams or in the flesh. Those visited by an incubus have recurring nightmares. Roll on or choose a result from the Incubus Nightmares table to inspire these night terrors. **Incubus Nightmares**`dice: [](incubus-xmm.md#^incubus-nightmares)`| dice: `dice: 1d8` | The Incubus's Victim Has Dreams Of... |

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of incubus xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around incubus xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[Incubus Xmm
