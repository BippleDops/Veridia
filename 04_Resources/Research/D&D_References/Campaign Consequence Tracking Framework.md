--- # Campaign Consequence Tracking Framework

*Mapping the Ripple Effects of Player Actions Across Two Worlds* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview This framework provides a systematic approach to tracking how player actions create cascading effects throughout the campaign world, ensuring that choices have meaningful, realistic consequences that shape the ongoing narrative. Each consequence chain is documented using a four-stage timeline that shows how immediate actions create expanding circles of impact across political, economic, social, and military spheres. ### Initial Action

**What the players did:**
- Specific action taken
- Location and context
- Primary participants
- Immediate witnesses **Who was directly affected:**
- Named NPCs impacted
- Organizations involved
- Geographical areas affected
- Social groups touched **Immediate visible results:**
- What players could observe immediately
- Initial NPC reactions
- Environmental changes
- Mechanical consequences (XP, items, etc.) ### Primary Ripples (Days/Weeks)

**Economic impacts:**
- Trade route disruptions
- Market price fluctuations
- Resource availability changes
- Employment effects
- Currency/wealth redistribution **Political shifts:**
- Policy changes
- Power realignments
- Diplomatic repercussions
- Legal/regulatory responses
- Authority challenges **Social changes:**
- Public opinion shifts
- Cultural/religious impacts
- Community relationships
- Information/rumor spread
- Lifestyle adaptations **Military responses:**
- Force deployments
- Security changes
- Strategic adjustments
- Recruitment/training modifications
- Alliance implications ### Secondary Ripples (Weeks/Months)

**Faction realignments:**
- New alliances formed
- Existing partnerships strained
- Power vacuum effects
- Leadership changes
- Territorial adjustments **Trade route changes:**
- Alternative pathway development
- Shipping schedule modifications
- Merchant behavior shifts
- Resource flow redirections
- Economic center migrations **Cultural shifts:**
- Belief system impacts
- Social norm evolution
- Artistic/literary responses
- Educational curriculum changes
- Language/communication adaptations **Power vacuum effects:**
- New organizations emerging
- Existing groups expanding
- Authority redistribution
- Control mechanism changes
- Influence network evolution ### Long-term Consequences (Months/Years)

**Permanent world changes:**
- Infrastructure modifications
- Institutional restructuring
- Technology/magic developments
- Population movements
- Environmental impacts **New conflicts arising:**
- Resource competition
- Ideological clashes
- Territorial disputes
- Succession crises
- Revolutionary movements **Unexpected alliances:**
- Former enemies cooperating
- Strange bedfellows emerging
- Cross-cultural partnerships
- Economic necessities driving unity
- Mutual threat responses **Future adventure hooks:**
- Unresolved tensions
- New mysteries created
- Power struggles developing
- Ancient secrets revealed
- Prophetic implications ### Documentation Standards

1. **Factual Recording**: Document what actually happened, not what was intended
2. **Multiple Perspectives**: Consider how different factions/individuals view the same events
3. Moreover, **Realistic Timelines**: Use believable timeframes for information spread and institutional change
4. **Interconnection Mapping**: Show how consequences in one area affect other spheres
5. **Player Agency Recognition**: Highlight how player choices specifically drove outcomes ### Assessment Criteria

**Magnitude Scale (1-5):**
- 1: Local, temporary effects
- 2: Regional, short-term impacts
- 3: Continental, medium-term changes
- 4: Cross-realm, long-term alterations
- 5: World-changing, permanent transformation **Visibility Rating (1-5):**
- 1: Completely hidden consequences
- 2: Known only to directly involved parties
- 3: Recognized by relevant communities/organizations
- 4: Public knowledge in affected regions
- 5: Common knowledge across multiple realms ## Cross-Reference Integration Each consequence chain should link to:

- **Session Journals**: Original action documentation
- **NPC Files**: Character development impacts
- **Faction Records**: Organizational response tracking
- **Location Notes**: Environmental/infrastructural changes
- **Quest Logs**: New adventure opportunities created ### Contingency Planning

- **Alternative Outcomes**: Multiple possible consequence paths
- **Intervention Points**: Where player actions could modify developing consequences
- **Escalation Triggers**: Events that would accelerate consequence development
- **Mitigation Strategies**: How consequences might be reduced/redirected
- **Amplification Factors**: What would make consequences more severe --- *"Every ripple in the pond reaches shores we never imagined. The art of consequence tracking is recognizing that today's small choice becomes tomorrow's great change."* ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*
