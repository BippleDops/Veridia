# Trap #4 - "Ye Olde Digit Dicer."
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> Once the doors have been discovered, and the plaster removed to reveal their size, (10 feet tall and 5 feet wide doubled as with [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]].), one other thing will be apparent: there are three finger-sized holes about waist high on the right hand door. This will seem clearly an unlocking or drawing open mechanism.
> 
> Keeping in mind the doors can be unlocked magically with no harm to anyone, a non-magic user may choose to insert a finger, or three fingers into these holes. In this case the center one will depress a mechanism that unlocks the door. The other two will depress mechanisms that release small steel blades that will slice off fingers that are not armoured. (Leather will not help; they must have bronze, or steel gauntlets.) This trap is a toss in,jusuo keep the party on it's toes. The series will be repeated on every door unless otherwise indicated, but the "correct" finger hole will vary. (l think Evin rood must have gotten a quantity discount on these.) Any finger sized object may be used to unlock the door, metal being preferred if you wish to keep the device used intact.
> 
> The doors in either case swing inward revealing a pair of stair cases. The one on the right leading down while the one on the left leads up. The stairs are 50 feet in length,rising or descending 50 feet to similar sets of double doors. There is no landing, the stairs stop flush to the doors.
> 
> If the party elects to explore the one to the right continue on to the next chapter, [[2 - Right Face|RIGHT FACE]]! If the party presses on to the left, page ahead to the chapter entitled [[3 - Leftward Ho|LEFTWARD HO]]! And if by some chance the party has found [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] behind the coffin then page on to the chapter entitled [[4 - The Path Less Traveled|THE PATH LESS TRAVELED]]!
