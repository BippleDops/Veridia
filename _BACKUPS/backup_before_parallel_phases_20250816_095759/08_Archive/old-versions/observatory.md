--- > [!figure] Map # Observatory

*Level 13 Bastion facility* - **Prerequisites**: Ability to use a [[spellcasting-focus-xphb (variant-rules)
- **Space**: Roomy (16 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 1
- **Order**: empower Situated atop your Bastion, your Observatory contains a telescope aimed at the night sky. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Observatory Charm You can use your Observatory to peer into the far corners of "Wildspace" and the "Astral Plane". After spending a Long Rest in your Observatory, you gain a magical [observatory]] (see ""Supernatural Gifts"" in "chapter 3") that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast [[Contact Other Plane Xphb without expending a spell slot. You can't gain this Charm again while you still have it. ## Empower: Eldritch Discovery When you issue the "Empower" order to this facility, you enable yourself or the facility's hireling to explore the eldritch mysteries of the stars for 7 consecutive nights. At the end of that time, roll a die. If the number rolled is even, nothing is gained. If the number rolled is odd, an unknown power bestows one of the following Charms on you or another creature of your choice that is on the same plane of existence as you: "Charm of Darkvision", "Charm of Heroism", or "Charm of Vitality" (all described in "chapter 3"). *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 343* ## Player-Facing Summary Observatory is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of observatory as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around observatory. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - The authorities needs help finding before winter
