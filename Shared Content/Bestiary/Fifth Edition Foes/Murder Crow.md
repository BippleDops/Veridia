## Special Traits
**Combat Mobility:** Opportunity attacks against a moving murder crow always have tactical disadvantage.

**Death Throes:** If a murder crow is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes into a swarm of ravens that continues to relentlessly attack all living creatures within sight. These ravens are undead, and they have tactical advantage on saving throws against being turned.

**Eye Rake:** If a murder crow hits the same target with its claws and beak in the same round, the target must make a successful DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded for `dice: 1d4` rounds. If a creature is blinded more than once during an encounter, the condition lasts until the creature is healed of all damage or the blindness is removed magically.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A murder crow attacks once with claws and once with its beak. If both attacks hit the same target, see Eye Rake above.

**Claws:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d8+3`) slashing damage.

**Beak:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d6+3`) piercing damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate
