## Special Traits
**Amorphous:** The swarm can move through gaps as small as 1 square inch without penalty. It can move through and remain in spaces occupied by other creatures without hindrance.

**Blend Into Darkness:** A swarm of bloody flux is invisible in dim light.

**Bloody Flux:** A creature that starts its turn in the same space as a swarm of bloody flux must make a successful DC 10 Con saving throw or contract the disease bloody flux. A creature that contracts bloody flux gains 1 level of exhaustion immediately and must make a DC 10 Con saving throw after every long rest. If the saving throw fails, the creature gains another level of exhaustion; if it succeeds, the creature recovers from 1 level of exhaustion. The disease ends when the creature has no levels of exhaustion or when it receives a lesser restoration spell or comparable magic.

**Regeneration:** The swarm heals 5 hit points at the start of its turn. This ability doesn’t function if it took cold or poison damage since its previous turn.

**Vulnerability to Healing:** A lesser restoration spell cast on a living disease kills the swarm instantly.

**Melee Attack—Swarm:** +7 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d8 + 2` piercing damage.

## Description
**Environment**: Urban (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary or plague (2-7)

Living diseases are swarms of harmful bacteria or viruses that have supernaturally gained limited sentience under exceedingly foul or magical conditions. They seek out hosts to propagate their contagion. Their individual components are microscopic; the only reason they can be seen is because they form swarms containing billions of individual organisms.

A living disease has the appearance of a floating shadow or dimness with indistinct edges. It offers no resistance to solid objects that enter its space; it can’t be felt even as a subtle dampness (like a mist) or coolness (like a shadow). They make no sound whatsoever. They’re most dangerous at twilight and nighttime, when their presence in a dimly-lit campsite or hovel is almost impossible to detect.

Living diseases are extremely rare, but they are also highly varied. There are potentially as many different kinds of living diseases as there are diseases. Only bloody flux is described here, but it can be used as a model for others. A living disease instinctively avoids undead, oozes, plants, constructs, and other creatures that aren’t suitable hosts.

This disease is endemic to the Sinks district of Castorhage, with a major outbreak occurring every few years though largely remaining contained to that portion of the city. On occasion, it spreads to other poor, overcrowded areas of the city where clean water is in short supply. Bloody flux is generally contracted through exposure to water that’s been contaminated with fecal matter from someone already suffering from the disease or, as is the case in the Sinks, the presence of one or more bloody flux living diseases that travel through sewers and along filthy gutters lining the streets. The disease enters the intestinal tract of the victim and causes inflammation resulting in fever, painful cramping, and frequent bloody diarrhea that leads to severe dehydration and eventually death.
