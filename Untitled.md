>>> The **Archmage** is the archetypal court mage -- he defends the PCs’ homeland, and drives forward magical research. He’s generally an heroic icon, but could be interpreted as ambiguous if more relevance is assigned to his reality-threatening magical experiments. He is supported by a magical bureaucracy of some kind -- it may be a guild, a ministry of magic, and so on.

>>> **The Crusader** is the armored fist of the Dark Gods. So long as followers of the gods of light stay the hell out of his way, the Crusader turns his wrath against the demons that would destroy the world his own gods want to rule. Follow the Crusader if you must win at any cost.

>>>  The **Diabolist** summons and controls forces of destruction (the demons in the 13th Age setting). Much like the Crusader, she is an evil force that might be a lesser evil than the monsters she controls -- i.e., she’s evil and unpredictable, but not entirely inhuman as they are. Her followers are generally secretive cultists who would wield the same forbidden powers as she does.

>>> **The Dwarf King** is lord of Forge, the dwarves’ new homeland beneath the mountains. He’d love to reclaim the dwarven Underhome lost to war against the dark elves and the creatures of the deeps. But now that the Empire is stumbling, the dwarves find themselves manning the mountain walls that shield the Empire from the orcs and monsters of the north.

>>> The **Elf Queen** rules over all elves, good and evil. She is the archetypal fey queen. Her followers are elves, of course, both light and dark. Depending on which faction is stronger, the behaviour of this Icon can change quite a bit.

>>> The **Emperor** rules a land defended by dragon riders, a very ancient human kingdom. He is supported by legions of soldiers and bureaucrats. He is the law of the PCs’ homeland, but also a force for the preservation of the status quo.

>>> The **Great Gold Wyrm** is the patron of Paladins. He is defined by his self-sacrificing nature, as he closes a gigantic portal to the Abyss with his body. Gold dragons, paladins and good-aligned beings are his followers.

>>> The **High Druid** leads magical creatures of the woods in a struggle against civilisation, represented by both the Emperor (and more in general the humans who would exploit the wilderness) and the Archmage (who would channel and exploit the magical aspects of nature). His followers are druids, woodland beings, and spirits of nature.

>>> The **Lich King** is a past ruler of the Emperor’s kingdom, returned as an undead liege. He wants to restore his rule, and operates with the support of undead and necromancers alike. While he is a generally villainous Icon, he actually aims at ruling the land, not destroying it.

>>> The **Orc Lord** is the archetypal barbarian leader. A past Orc Lord invasion ended the Lich King’s reign. He leads a marauding army from outside the boundaries of the civilised lands. He can be the main opponent of the Emperor, or a force to use against his enemies.

>>> The **Priestess** represents the “good gods”. She is a sort of high priest for all the good-aligned faiths of the land. Thus, her followers are clerics and good planeborns.

>>> The **Prince of Shadows** is the king of thieves -- a trickster figure, but also a villain. His followers are, obviously, a thieves’ guild (as well as an assassin’s guild). The Dwarf King and other law-oriented Icons are obviously enemies of the Prince of Shadows.
