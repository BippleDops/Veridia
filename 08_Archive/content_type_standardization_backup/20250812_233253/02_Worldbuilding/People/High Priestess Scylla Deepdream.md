# High Priestess Scylla Deepdream

## Overview
Once a surface world oracle who foresaw the Great Drowning, Scylla chose to drown herself ritually to gain the power to shape it. Now barely recognizable as having been human, she leads the Wake faction in their mission to awaken Thal'mexis and drown the surface world completely. She speaks only in prophecies and views linear time as a quaint limitation.

## Appearance
- Upper body maintains vaguely feminine humanoid shape
- Lower body splits into eight tentacles of compressed water
- Skin translucent, showing memories flowing like blood
- Eyes replaced by whirlpools that show possible futures
- Wears crown of crystallized screams from the first drowning
- Voice echoes from past and future simultaneously

## Personality
- Experiences all moments of her existence simultaneously
- Shows compassion by offering "merciful drowning"
- Genuinely believes drowning is evolution, not death
- Speaks in riddles because linear thought is impossible
- Loves all beings but in an alien, consuming way

## Relationships

- **That-Which-Swims-Between:** Uneasy alliance of convenience
- **Morpheus Tidecaller:** Eternal ideological enemy
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]]:** Knows his true identity, prophesied his fall

## Combat Tactics

- Transforms battlefield into underwater environment
- Retreats through time rather than space

## Minions
- **Drowned Saints:** Former heroes transformed
- **Temporal Shadows:** Versions from other timelines
- **Memory Wisps:** Extracted consciousnesses
- **Depth Angels:** Celestials corrupted by pressure

## Plot Hooks
1. Infiltrating surface churches through dreams
2. Kidnapping specific individuals for prophecy
3. Needs ancient artifact from before drowning
4. Seeking to corrupt one of the Seven Shards

## Quotes
- "I have already seen you drown. Would you like to know when?"
- "The surface tension breaks. It always has been breaking."
- "Your future flows into my past. Shall we swim together?"
- "Death is a shallow concept. Let me show you depth."

## DM Notes
Scylla represents the alien horror of Aquabyssos—someone who chose transformation and can't understand why others resist. Her temporal abilities make her nearly impossible to surprise or defeat conventionally. She should feel like a force of nature rather than a person, speaking in paradoxes and prophecies that come true in unexpected ways. Her genuine belief that she's saving the world through drowning makes her sympathetic yet terrifying.
