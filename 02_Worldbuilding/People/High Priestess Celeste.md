## Lore Details

Legends speak of High Priestess Celeste as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around High Priestess Celeste.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties High Priestess Celeste to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
