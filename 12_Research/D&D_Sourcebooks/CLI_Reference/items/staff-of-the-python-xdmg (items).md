# Staff of the Python
*Staff, weapon, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/staff-of-the-python.webp#right)

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[item properties#Versatile|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

As a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you can throw this staff so that it lands in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you, causing the staff to become a [[giant-constrictor-snake-xmm (beast)]] in that space. The snake is under your control and shares your [[Initiative Xphb]] count, taking its turn immediately after yours.

On your turn, you can mentally command the snake (no action required) if it is within 60 feet of you and you don't have the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] condition. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location. Absent commands from you, the snake defends itself.

As a [[Action Xphb]], you can command the snake to revert to staff form in its current space, and you can't use the staff's property again for 1 hour. If the snake is reduced to 0 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]], it dies and reverts to its staff form; the staff then shatters and is destroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before losing all its [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]], it regains all of them.
