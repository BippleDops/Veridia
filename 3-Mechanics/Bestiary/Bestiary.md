## üéØ DM Notes

### Bestiary Management Tips:
- **CR Balance**: Ensure encounters have appropriate challenge ratings for your party level
- **Environment Variety**: Mix creatures from different environments to keep encounters interesting
- **Type Diversity**: Include different creature types to test various party abilities
- **Story Integration**: Connect monsters to ongoing plot threads and world events

### Encounter Building:
- **Single Monster**: CR should be party level + 2 for a challenging solo encounter
- **Multiple Monsters**: Use lower CR creatures in groups of 3-6
- **Mixed Encounters**: Combine different creature types for tactical variety
- **Environmental Hazards**: Add terrain and weather effects to enhance encounters
