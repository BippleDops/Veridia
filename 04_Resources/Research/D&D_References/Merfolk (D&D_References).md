Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Merfolk as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Merfolk. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The First Prophecy of Stars ## Plot Hooks - A merchant needs help delivering before dawn

- Strange accidents suggest a conspiracy ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
