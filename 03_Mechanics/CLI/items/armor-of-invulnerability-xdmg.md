- **Armor Class**: 18
- **Strength**: Requires 15 STR.
- **Stealth**: The wearer has disadvantage on Stealth (DEX) checks.

You have [Resistance](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage while you wear this armor.

## Metal Shell

You can take a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to give yourself [Immunity](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage for 10 minutes or until you are no longer wearing the armor. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
