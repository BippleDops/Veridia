      \ Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters\
      \ it later, must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save,\
      \ the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save,\
      \ the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and\
      \ also gains a random form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the\
      \ Madness of Zuggtmoy table in appendix D) that lasts until the creature is\
      \ cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't\
      \ be reinfected, and it must be repeat the saving throw at the end of every\
      \ 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's\
      \ body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves,\
      \ the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature\
      \ that can be (see the \"Myconids\" entry in the Monster Manual)."
