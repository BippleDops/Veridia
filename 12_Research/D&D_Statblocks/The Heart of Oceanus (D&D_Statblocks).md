## Overview
The Heart of Oceanus is not merely an entityâ€”it is the living embodiment of all ocean waters throughout existence. Ancient beyond mortal comprehension, it represents the primordial force that first brought water to the worlds. Unlike gods who rule over domains, the Heart of Oceanus IS the ocean in its purest, most conscious form. It speaks through currents, dreams through tides, and feels every drop of water as part of its infinite being.

## Physical Manifestation
The Heart of Oceanus rarely takes physical form, existing instead as a presence felt throughout all waters. When it does manifest:

- **Appearance**: A constantly shifting form of living water, sometimes appearing as a massive humanoid figure composed entirely of flowing ocean, other times as swirling patterns of current and light
- **Size**: Variableâ€”can appear as large as a kraken or as small as a child, though its true size encompasses all oceans
- **Texture**: Pure, crystalline water that moves independently of gravity, containing schools of luminescent fish and floating kelp
- **Eyes**: Shifting vortexes that show the depths of all oceans simultaneously
- **Voice**: The sound of waves, currents, and deep-sea winds combined into speech
- **Presence**: The temperature drops, water sources nearby become perfectly pure, and all sea creatures become calm and attentive

### The First Waters
Before worlds had oceans, before life learned to swim, there was the Heart of Oceanus. It is the primordial water-consciousness that existed in the void, the first drop that became the first sea. When creation began, it willingly spread itself across infinite worlds to bring the gift of water and life.

### The Great Sacrifice
Unlike other primordial entities that sought to dominate creation, the Heart of Oceanus chose to fragment itself into every body of water, every raindrop, every tear. This supreme sacrifice allowed life to flourish but left the entity scattered and weakened, speaking now only through the collective voice of all waters.

### Connection to Aquabyssos
Aquabyssos holds special significance as the Heart's most concentrated presence in any single realm. The city exists within what could be considered the Heart's "main body"â€”the deepest, purest manifestation of its consciousness. Every citizen of Aquabyssos carries a tiny fragment of the Heart within their blood.

## Divine Abilities

**Water Omnipresence**: The Heart exists simultaneously in all water everywhere. It can perceive events occurring near any body of water and speak through any source of H2O.

**Oceanic Authority**: Complete control over all water, from molecular manipulation to continental weather patterns. Can create tsunamis, calm storms, or turn deserts into seas.

**Life-Giver**: Can spontaneously generate any form of aquatic life, from microscopic plankton to massive leviathans. All sea creatures instinctively serve and protect it.

**Purification**: Can instantly cleanse any contamination from water sources, including magical corruption, disease, and even concepts like "cursed" or "unholy" water.

**Tidal Memory**: Remembers everything that has ever occurred in or near water. Can share these memories through dreams, visions, or by temporarily connecting minds to the "ocean of consciousness."

**Current Manipulation**: Controls the flow of all water, including bloodstream in living creatures (though it rarely uses this aggressively). Can create instantaneous travel through water currents across any distance.

**Weather Command**: Direct control over all water-based weather: rain, snow, fog, storms, humidity. Its emotional state directly influences global weather patterns.

**Deep Speech**: Communicates through sensations, emotions, and images rather than words. All water-dwelling creatures understand its intent automatically.

### Primary Objectives
1. **Protect All Waters**: Prevent contamination, over-exploitation, or destruction of water sources
2. **Preserve Ocean Life**: Ensure the survival and flourishing of all aquatic species
3. **Maintain Balance**: Keep the water cycle functioning properly across all worlds
4. **Guide Aquabyssos**: Serve as the ultimate patron and protector of the underwater realm
5. **Heal Ancient Wounds**: Slowly repair damage done to oceans by wars, pollution, and supernatural corruption

## Secrets and Hidden Truths

> [!warning] DM Secrets
> - **The Great Weakness**: The Heart can be temporarily "stunned" if enough of its water is simultaneously contaminated or destroyed
> - **The Missing Piece**: A portion of the Heart was stolen/separated long ago and exists as a separate entity elsewhere
> - **The Final Tide**: If mortals continue polluting oceans, the Heart may reclaim all water, ending life on dry land
> - **Blood Connection**: Every person who has ever cried has a microscopic connection to the Heart through their tears
> - **The Deep Prison**: The Heart has been unknowingly containing an ancient evil in the deepest ocean trenches
> - **Convergence Truth**: The dimensional merger threatens to "dilute" the Heart across too many realities

### The Heart's Dilemma
The Heart faces an impossible choice: remain fragmented and gentle, allowing mortals free will with water but risking corruption and abuse, or reunify its consciousness and impose absolute control over all waters, saving the oceans but enslaving all water-dependent life.

### Legendary Resistance (5/Day)
If the Heart fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

### Water Omnipresence
The Heart exists in all water simultaneously. Destroying its manifestation only disperses it temporarily. It reforms in 24 hours unless all ocean water is destroyed (impossible).

### Oceanic Authority
All water within 10 miles obeys the Heart's will. It can reshape terrain, create whirlpools, summon tsunamis, or calm storms as bonus actions.

### Life Connection
All aquatic creatures within 50 miles gain +2 to attack rolls and saving throws. The Heart takes half damage when water-dwelling creatures it considers "children" are harmed nearby.

### Actions

**Multiattack**: The Heart can cast a spell and use one other action.

**Tidal Wave**: Every creature in a 300-foot line must make a DC 24 Strength saving throw. On failure, they take 65 (10d12) bludgeoning damage and are pushed 100 feet. On success, half damage and pushed 50 feet.

**Drowning Grasp**: The Heart controls water in a creature's lungs. Target within 1 mile must make DC 24 Constitution save or begin drowning regardless of their ability to breathe water. This continues until the Heart releases them or they succeed on three saves.

**Oceanic Wrath** (Recharge 5-6): All water within 5 miles becomes violently turbulent. All creatures touching water take 45 (10d8) bludgeoning damage (DC 24 Dex save for half) and are stunned for 1 round.

**Leviathan Summon** (1/Day): The Heart calls 1d4+1 ancient sea monsters (use Kraken stats) that arrive in 1d4 rounds and serve for 1 hour.

**Primordial Healing** (3/Day): The Heart can cast *mass heal* affecting all creatures in a 1-mile radius, or restore all water in that area to perfect purity.

### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)
The Heart can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below.

**Move**: The Heart moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Current Command**: The Heart repositions all creatures within 500 feet as if by *telekinesis*.

**Tide Speak**: The Heart communicates with all water-dwelling creatures within 10 miles, coordinating their actions.

**Oceanic Spell** (Costs 2 Actions): The Heart casts a spell of 7th level or lower.

**Heart's Blessing** (Costs 3 Actions): The Heart grants all allies within 1 mile temporary immunity to one damage type for 1 minute.

## Lair Actions
When in its deepest domain, the Heart can take lair actions on initiative count 20:

**Deep Current**: All creatures are moved up to 100 feet in any direction the Heart chooses.

**Oceanic Memory**: The Heart shares a vision of past events that occurred in this water, potentially revealing hidden truths or tactical information.

**Life Bloom**: All water in the area teams with new life. Friendly creatures regain 50 hit points, hostile creatures face swarms of angry sea life.

## Regional Effects
The Heart's presence affects entire ocean regions:
- All water within 100 miles is perfectly pure and health-giving
- Weather patterns favor sea travel and aquatic life
- Ocean creatures are more intelligent and cooperative
- Ships find favorable currents and winds
- Underwater structures resist corrosion and damage
- Fresh water sources near coastlines are replenished daily

## Adventure Hooks

1. **The Bleeding Ocean**: Something is poisoning the Heart through contaminated water sources. Find and stop the source before the entity dies, taking all oceans with it.

2. **The Deep Communion**: The Heart offers to share the oceanic memory of a crucial historical event, but accessing it requires swimming to the deepest trench and surviving the pressure of pure divine consciousness.

3. **The Stolen Tears**: A faction has captured a fragment of the Heart (formed from the collected tears of innocents) and is using it to control weather patterns. Rescue it before the Heart becomes too weak to maintain global water cycles.

4. **The Final Choice**: The Heart reveals its dilemma about reunification vs. fragmentation and asks the party to help it decide. Their choice will fundamentally change how water works in all realms.

5. **The Dry Zones**: Mysterious areas where water simply disappears, leaving behind salt and confused sea life. Investigation reveals an ancient enemy of the Heart has returned and is literally eating water out of existence.

6. **The Deep Parliament**: The Heart summons representatives from all water-dwelling civilizations to address the threats from the Convergence. The party must serve as advocates for surface interests in this underwater diplomatic crisis.

7. **The Ocean's Heart Beats**: The party discovers that certain tidal patterns match a heartbeatâ€”the Heart's heartbeat. When the rhythm changes, they must investigate whether it's due to illness, attack, or preparation for something momentous.

8. **The Last Drop**: In a post-apocalyptic scenario, the Heart has retreated to a single remaining ocean. The party must convince it to spread water to new worlds, or help it defend its final sanctuary against those who would abuse its power.

### Relationship Dynamics
**With Mortals**: Protective but distant, like a grandparent watching over countless descendants
**With Other Powers**: Diplomatic but firm about water rights, willing to negotiate everything except harm to ocean life
**With Enemies**: Patient until pushed too far, then utterly devastating in response
**With Champions**: Nurturing and generous, sharing power freely with those who prove worthy

## Story Integration
The Heart of Oceanus serves as the ultimate environmental patron, the voice of ocean consciousness, and a reminder that some powers are too vast for mortal control. It can provide cosmic perspective on local conflicts while remaining personally invested in every drop of water and every swimming creature.

Its presence in campaigns can:
- Provide moral weight to environmental themes
- Serve as ultimate judge of character for water-based conflicts
- Offer both incredible power and terrible responsibility to those who earn its favor
- Create scenarios where the greatest power requires the greatest sacrifice
- Bridge the gap between cosmic forces and personal, intimate connections to nature

The Heart represents the philosophy that true power comes from giving rather than taking, and that the greatest strength is often shown through restraint and nurturing rather than domination.

## Player-Facing Summary

The Heart of Oceanus is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of The Heart of Oceanus as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around The Heart of Oceanus.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
