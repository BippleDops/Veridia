# Aethermoor-Aquabyssos World Connection Guide
## The Convergence of Surface and Depth

> *"Two worlds, divided by catastrophe, united by necessity."*

## 🌐 Dimensional Architecture

### The Three States of Reality

#### State 1: Complete Separation (Historical)
- **Timeline**: 300 years ago to present
- **Barrier**: The Surface Seal - magical membrane preventing interaction
- **Aethermoor**: Develops crystal magic, faction conflicts
- **Aquabyssos**: Evolves underwater civilization, depth adaptations
- **Connection Points**: None (sealed)

#### State 2: Partial Merger (Current Campaign)
- **Timeline**: Post-Crystal Festival events
- **Barrier**: Weakening, selective breaches
- **Merged Zones**:
  - [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian ↔ [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Abyssos Prime Upper Districts]]
  - [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Lighthouse of Storms ↔ [02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Inverse Palace]]
  - [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Crystal Gardens ↔ [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Screaming Gardens]]
- **Mechanics**: Reality shifts every 12 hours

#### State 3: Full Convergence (Possible Future)
- **Timeline**: After Deep Mother resolution
- **Barrier**: Completely dissolved
- **New Geography**:
  - Floating Aquabyssos districts above Aethermoor cities
  - Inverted waterfalls connecting realms
  - Shared atmospheric zones (air/water hybrid)
- **Population**: Integrated society with adaptation variations

## 🔄 Continental Connections

   - Cost: Temporary memory loss

4. **Shadow Passages**
   - Created by shadow separation events

   - Requirement: Shadow independence
   - Warning: One-way without shadow mastery
