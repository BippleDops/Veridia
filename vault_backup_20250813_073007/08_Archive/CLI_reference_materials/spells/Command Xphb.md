# Command
*1st-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn. Choose the command from these options:

- **Approach.** The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.  
- **Drop.** The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.  
- **Flee.** The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.  
- **Grovel.** The target has the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Prone|Prone]] condition and then ends its turn.  
- **Halt.** On its turn, the target doesn't move and takes no action or [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]].  

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can affect one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1.

## Player-Facing Summary

Command xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of command xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around command xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties command xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at command xphb to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to command xphb active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
