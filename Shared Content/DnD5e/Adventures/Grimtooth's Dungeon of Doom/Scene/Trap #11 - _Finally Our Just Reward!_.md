# Trap #11 - "Finally Our Just Reward!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The room is entered left of center. It is 20 fee wide, 30 feet long and 10 feet in heighL All eyes will be drawn to an elaborate coffin at the end of the room. It is made of an ornately carved green stone, and seems to rest on a pedestal consisting of three steps leading up to the actual coffin. The steps are 3 feel high, and the sides of the sarcophagus are an additional 4 feet high bringing the top of the whole affair within 3 feet of the ceiling.
> 
> The figures on the sides of the elaborate coffin are not the usual geometric designs, but a series of images of a man growing up. There are scenes of his youth, adolescence, and young manhood on the side facing the center of the room. There are no signs of slits, openings, or any sign of trap doors or hidden compartments on the outside of the coffin. Even magic detects none of the above! This box is entirely safe, (No, really, would good old Grimtooth lie to you?) By now the party would not be sure if they had a written guarantee, but they will eventually draw on hidden reserves of greed and open the sarcophagus.
> 
> Within they will find their wildest dreams come true. Peering into the container they will see a layer of what seems to be fine gold bricks. They are in fact lead bricks plated with gold. Only a [[Dwarf (D&D 5e SRD)|dwarf]] with the dwarves affinity for metal work would be able to tell, and he would have only have a 50-50 chance with bonuses depending on his metal working skill.
> 
> The party will be somewhat dismayed that the level of the gold seems to be below the level of the container itself, as if it were in the stepped pedestal instead. The pocket in which the gold is resting conforms to the interior dimensions of the sarcophagus. To reach the first layer of bricks a member of the party will have to lean over the side, and at that the gold will be 4 feet down. Even a long-armed human-sized character will have some difficulty touching, let alone lifting out a sample. The easiest way to remove the ingots is for one member of the party to get into the sarcophagus and hand out the gold. Again there should be some wrangling over just who the sacrificial lamb ... er .. .lucky volunteer will be. This sort of thing is almost as much fun as watching the [[8 - Traps (D&D 5e SRD)|traps]] actually operate. Eventually they will either come up with a way of lifting out the gold, or one of their number will enter the coffin. This is when the real fun begins.
> 
> This trap is activated by weight, or rather the absence or presence of same. If a brave member of the party jumps in the weight on the plate below the gold is increased and one part of this trap is set off. The sides of the "pedestal" are really concentric boxes of stone that when released are forced into the ceiling by hydraulic pressure from below. (See diagram.) This will trap the character in the sarcophagus within three feet of stone, and subject anyone standing on the stairs to the threat of being crushed into the ceiling. Any member of the party standing on the stairs will have a 30% chance of being crushed (L3).
> 
> If the party has a method of lifting out an ingot, either by having a long armed fellow [[Strength (D&D 5e SRD)|lift]] it out by bending WAAAAYY over, or by magic they will lighten the weight on the plate in the bottom. This has the effect of releasing the bottom of the sarcophagus, gold and all to smash into the ceiling! The effect on the guy reaching in when the ingot is lifted will be interesting. There is a 40% chance he will be able to get clear; hopping up, out, and backwards, bent nearly double, leaning into a hole, and holding an ingot of [[3 - Weapons (D&D 5e SRD)|heavy]] metal. Wow! It could be an olympic event, the Up, Out, and Back 1/2 Bent Ingot Toss!
> 
> Once the gold is mashed into the ceiling, along with what ever other grisly [[11 - Objects (D&D 5e SRD)|objects]] it picks up on the way, the party can work the bricks free. There will be a gross (144) of the lead-filled ingots. The gold plate is nominal perhaps as much as 250 g.p., but the lead too has a market value, at one copper piece per weight unit, or about 14,400 copper pieces. ( or another 144 g.p.)
> 
> I rate the outside pedestal stairs a two skull er, easy enough to get off if you are quick. Of course if the delvers don't have a way to tunnel through the 3 feet of stone, the poor boob trapped inside the sarcophagus is gone from lack of air eventually. Now the plate inside the coffin rates four skulls for the contortion value alone. Keep in mind that even if the outside pedestal trap has been tripped the inner trap is still intact. If the party is resourceful enough to get back in to the trapped man, and he hands out enough ingots the inside trap will activate. Or if he gets out and tries to take an ingot with him when his feet leave the bottom, snap! Or if he gets out then leans in to snag an ingot..:well you get the idea. Loads of fun for the party!
