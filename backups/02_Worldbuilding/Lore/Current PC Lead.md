# Current PC Lead

*"Leadership flows like the tides - sometimes gentle guidance, sometimes crushing force."*

## Overview

The concept of PC Lead refers to the rotating or situational leadership dynamics within the adventuring party. In the depths of Aquabyssos, where swift decisions can mean the difference between survival and drowning in the crushing darkness, clear leadership becomes essential. Unlike surface politics, underwater leadership often shifts based on expertise, situation, and the crushing pressure of the deep.

This dynamic leadership structure has evolved from necessity rather than tradition. When navigating the treacherous currents of political intrigue in the Pearl Palace or confronting eldritch horrors in the Abyssal Depths, different party members naturally step forward based on their strengths, connections, and understanding of the situation.

## Historical Background

The tradition of fluid leadership emerged from the earliest diving expeditions from the surface world. When Aethermoor's explorers first descended into the ocean depths, rigid command structures often proved fatal. The ocean demanded adaptability - a master navigator might lead during treacherous currents, while a diplomat would take point during negotiations with merfolk courts.

This practice was formalized by the Order of the Depths, one of Aquabyssos's founding organizations. Their doctrine stated that "leadership flows to where it is needed most," establishing precedents that modern adventuring parties still follow. The philosophy spread through both worlds as successful expeditions returned with tales of adaptive leadership saving lives and missions.

## Current State

In the present campaign, party leadership shifts based on context and expertise. During social encounters in Aquabyssos's noble courts, characters with diplomatic training or local connections naturally assume command. When facing magical threats or researching ancient mysteries, scholarly party members take the lead. Combat situations might see the most tactically minded character directing strategy.

This fluid dynamic creates both opportunities and challenges. While it maximizes the party's collective strengths, it can also lead to confusion during critical moments when multiple members might attempt to lead simultaneously.

## Cultural Impact

### Aquabyssos
Fluid leadership aligns perfectly with Aquabyssos's current-based philosophy. Just as ocean currents shift and change, so too should leadership flow to where it's most effective. Noble houses often employ similar structures in their own organizations, with different family members taking charge based on the situation's demands.

### Aethermoor
Surface dwellers initially viewed this concept with suspicion, preferring clear hierarchies and established chains of command. However, as more successful expeditions returned using flexible leadership models, Aethermoor's adventuring guilds began adopting similar practices, though often with more formal structures and protocols.

## Mechanics

### Requirements
- Party consensus on leadership transitions
- Clear communication of who leads in each situation
- Respect for the designated leader's decisions
- Flexibility to adapt when situations change

### Effects
- Maximizes party effectiveness in diverse situations
- Prevents single points of failure in leadership
- Encourages character development and specialization
- Can create confusion if transitions aren't clear

### Duration
Leadership typically shifts based on:
- Scene changes (social to combat to exploration)
- Expertise requirements (magical, diplomatic, tactical)
- Character availability and condition
- Group consensus and natural dynamics

## Notable Examples

- **The Tidecrest Expedition**: Famous for having seven different leaders during their month-long deep-sea exploration
- **The Silverscale Negotiations**: Where leadership changed hands five times during a single diplomatic dinner
- **The Crystal Chamber Incident**: Rapid leadership transitions during combat saved the entire party from crystalline mimics

## Key Figures

- **Captain Marlowe Tidecrest**: Pioneered formal adaptive leadership protocols
- **Diplomat Marina Currentborn**: Established social leadership transition customs
- **Tactician Drake Deepstrike**: Created combat leadership quick-change procedures

## Mysteries

- Whether certain magical influences can affect leadership dynamics
- The role of destiny or fate in determining who leads at crucial moments
- How leadership dynamics change under extreme pressure or corruption exposure

## Adventure Hooks

1. **Leadership Crisis**: The party must choose a leader for a critical diplomatic mission, but each member has valid claims
2. **Succession Challenge**: An NPC challenges the party's leadership structure, demanding a formal hierarchy
3. **Mind Control**: Magical influence affects the party's leadership dynamics, creating confusion and conflict

## Secrets (DM Only)

The Abyssal currents actually respond to strong leadership presence. Parties with clear, confident leaders find navigation easier, while those with leadership conflicts often become lost in the maze-like deep passages. This supernatural effect is unknown to most inhabitants.

## Campaign Use

Encourage players to naturally assume leadership roles based on their characters' strengths and the situation. Use leadership transitions as opportunities for character development and to highlight different party members' expertise. Create scenarios that specifically require different types of leadership to showcase the value of this flexible approach.
