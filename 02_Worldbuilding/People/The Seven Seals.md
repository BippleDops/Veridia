# The Seven Seals

*Ancient guardians of reality's foundations*

## Overview

The Seven Seals are not merely individuals but incarnated concepts—living embodiments of the fundamental forces that keep Aquabyssos anchored to reality and prevent the Deep Mother's awakening. Each Seal is both a person and a cosmic function, reincarnating through the ages whenever their predecessor falls. They operate in absolute secrecy, as knowledge of their existence would make them targets for every cult, would-be conqueror, and reality-warping entity in the realm.

Founded in the wake of the First Drowning (3,000 years ago), the Seven Seals were created through a desperate ritual that bound seven heroes to eternal service. They guard the Anchor Points—metaphysical locations where reality is literally bolted to the fundamental structure of existence.

## The Current Seven

### First Seal: The Depth Warden
**Current Incarnation**: Malachus Ironheart
**Age**: 47 (312th incarnation)
**Location**: The Abyssal Monastery

The Depth Warden maintains the barrier between the physical ocean and the Dream Depths where the Deep Mother slumbers. Malachus was a common fisherman who inherited the Seal when he accidentally witnessed the previous Warden's death. He struggles with the weight of cosmic responsibility, often drowning his doubts in meditation and rigorous training.

**Malachus Ironheart, First Seal** (CR 17)
*Medium humanoid (human), lawful neutral*

**Armor Class** 20 (Seal of Depths)
**Hit Points** 180 (19d8 + 95)
**Speed** 30 ft., swim 60 ft.

STR 20 (+5), DEX 14 (+2), CON 20 (+5), INT 16 (+3), WIS 22 (+6), CHA 18 (+4)

**Saving Throws** Str +11, Con +11, Wis +12, Cha +10
**Skills** Athletics +11, Insight +12, Perception +12, Religion +9
**Damage Resistances** psychic, necrotic
**Damage Immunities** cold
**Condition Immunities** charmed, exhaustion, frightened
**Senses** truesight 120 ft., passive Perception 22
**Languages** All, telepathy 120 ft.
**Challenge** 17 (18,000 XP)

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Malachus fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Seal Bearer.** Malachus cannot be killed while his Anchor Point remains intact. If reduced to 0 hit points, he reforms at the Anchor Point in 1d10 days.

**Reality Anchor.** Malachus is immune to any effect that would alter his form, teleport him, or send him to another plane against his will.

**Deep Ward.** Creatures within 30 feet of Malachus have advantage on saving throws against madness and Deep Mother corruption.

**Actions**
**Multiattack.** Malachus makes three attacks with Tidecaller.

**Tidecaller (Trident).** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 10 ft. or range 30/90 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) force damage. If thrown, it returns to his hand immediately.

**Depth Seal (Recharge 5-6).** Malachus creates a 30-foot radius sphere of reality reinforcement. For 1 minute, no teleportation, summoning, or planar travel can occur within the sphere, and all creatures have resistance to psychic damage.

**Legendary Actions**
Malachus can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below.
- **Move.** Malachus moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Attack.** Malachus makes one weapon attack.
- **Seal Pulse (Costs 2 Actions).** Each creature within 30 feet must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be pushed 30 feet away and stunned until the end of Malachus's next turn.

### Second Seal: The Memory Keeper
**Current Incarnation**: Lysara the Forgotten
**Age**: Unknown (forgets her own age)
**Location**: The Archive of Unremembered Things

The Memory Keeper maintains the collective unconscious of Aquabyssos, preventing the Deep Mother from infiltrating dreams and memories. Lysara sacrifices her own memories to strengthen the seal—she cannot remember her life before becoming a Seal, or even what she did yesterday. She navigates existence through written notes to herself.

**Special Abilities**:
- Can erase or restore memories with a touch
- Immune to all mind-affecting magic
- Can witness any event that has been forgotten
- Maintains a library of removed memories

### Third Seal: The Tide Turner
**Current Incarnation**: Captain Nereus Stormborn
**Age**: 73 (17th incarnation)
**Location**: The Eternal Lighthouse

The Tide Turner controls the fundamental currents of magic in Aquabyssos, preventing them from flowing toward the Deep Mother. Nereus commands a ghost ship crewed by the spirits of previous Tide Turners, sailing impossible routes between reality and dream.

**The Inevitable Current** (Ghost Ship)
- Can sail through solid matter
- Exists in multiple dimensions simultaneously
- Crew of 23 previous incarnations
- Armed with cannons that fire concentrated reality

### Fourth Seal: The Pearl Guardian
**Current Incarnation**: Child-Oracle Mei
**Age**: 9 (1st incarnation)
**Location**: The Innocent Garden

The Pearl Guardian maintains the purity of creation, representing hope and innocence that the Deep Mother cannot corrupt. Mei is always a child, dying before their tenth birthday and immediately reincarnating. They possess perfect prescience but can only speak in nursery rhymes and children's songs.

**Unique Traits**:
- Cannot be harmed by anyone over 10 years old
- Prophecies are always accurate but incomprehensible
- Surrounded by protective spirits of children
- Their laughter weakens Deep Mother influence

### Fifth Seal: The Pressure Bearer
**Current Incarnation**: Golem-Monk Ashara
**Age**: 891 (2nd incarnation)
**Location**: The Weight of Worlds

The Pressure Bearer literally holds up the crushing weight of reality, preventing it from collapsing into the void where the Deep Mother dwells. Ashara's body has transformed into living stone from the constant pressure. She has not moved from her meditation position in 400 years.

**Physical Manifestation**:
- 12 feet tall, made of compressed coral and stone
- Each breath takes one hour
- Heartbeat causes minor earthquakes
- Blood is liquid diamond

### Sixth Seal: The Echo Silencer
**Current Incarnation**: [REDACTED]
**Age**: [REDACTED]
**Location**: The Quiet Place

The Echo Silencer prevents the Deep Mother's whispers from propagating through reality. Their identity is unknown even to the other Seals—knowledge of their existence would itself become a whisper the Deep Mother could exploit. They exist in a state of constant un-being.

**Known Facts**:
- May or may not be singular entity
- Communicates only through absence
- Their presence causes temporary deafness
- Might be the silence between heartbeats

### Seventh Seal: The Final Key
**Current Incarnation**: All and None
**Age**: Eternal and Never
**Location**: Everywhere and Nowhere

The Seventh Seal is not a person but a distributed consciousness across all living beings in Aquabyssos. Every act of kindness, every moment of joy, every gesture of love strengthens this seal. It is the collective will to exist that holds back the tide of oblivion.

**Manifestations**:
- Random acts of heroism by ordinary people
- Spontaneous festivals during dark times
- Children's laughter during storms
- The decision to go on living

The Fourth Seal (Child-Oracle Mei) has been accused of a crime they prophesied. The party must prove their innocence while protecting them from those who would use a child's power.

## DM Notes

### Running the Seven Seals

**Revelation Progression**:
1. **Levels 1-5**: Hints and rumors only
2. **Levels 6-10**: Meet a Witness
3. **Levels 11-15**: Encounter a Seal
4. **Levels 16-20**: Become involved in Seal business

**Campaign Integration**:
- Seals work best as background mythology
- Individual Seals can be patrons or quest givers
- Protecting Seals creates moral dilemmas
- Breaking a Seal could be campaign climax

### Power Balance
- Seals are not meant to be fought directly
- Their power comes with massive restrictions
- Death of a Seal should have cosmic consequences
- Players might become Witnesses or even Seals

### The Secret Truth
Unknown to all but the GM: The Seven Seals are not protecting reality from the Deep Mother—they ARE the Deep Mother, split into seven aspects to prevent her from awakening to her true nature. The day all Seven realize this truth is the day reality ends.
