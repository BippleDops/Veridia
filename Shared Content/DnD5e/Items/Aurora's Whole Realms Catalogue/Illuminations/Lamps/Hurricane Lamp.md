## Description
This oil lamp is most notable for its reputation for not blowing out once lit. The glass cylinder which protects the open flame, quaintly referred to as a chimney, is what prevents the errant breeze or any quick motion of the person bearing the lamp from extinguishing it. My hurricane [[Lamps|lamps]] are quite beautiful, as each features a matching design etched into both its [[Metal|metal]] base and its elegant blown glass chimney. A delicate cog arrangement of dwarven manufacture raises and lowers the braided wick. Brass, 1 gp; copper, 4 gp; or silver 12 gp. Available with floral or geometric pattern.

## Additional Details
Lights an area 20 feet in diameter, with a 5-foot area of semidarkness. Burns for eight hours on one pint of oil, and holds one pint. Light cannot be extinguished accidentally without removing the glass chimney first. At the DM’s discretion, the lamp can receive a saving throw as a third level fighter versus spells that might extinguish its flame—for instance, gust of wind.
