The Crimson Hand Strike Team represents Aethermoor's most elite and secretive military unit, specializing in high-risk operations that require absolute discretion and exceptional skill. Officially, this unit does not exist in any public military records, operating under deep cover protocols that allow plausible deniability for the Aethermoor government. The team handles threats too sensitive for regular military forces and too dangerous for conventional intelligence operatives, from assassination missions to the retrieval of reality-altering artifacts. Comprising individuals selected from across Aethermoor's military branches, intelligence services, and occasionally civilian specialists, the Crimson Hand operates with unprecedented autonomy and resources. Each member undergoes extensive psychological conditioning and magical enhancement to ensure absolute loyalty and capability in extreme circumstances. The team's existence is known only to the highest levels of Aethermoor government and select intelligence officials. ### Origins

The Crimson Hand Strike Team was formed in the aftermath of the Meridian Crisis, when conventional military responses proved inadequate against unconventional threats emerging from Aquabyssos. Early intelligence reports indicated that standard diplomatic and military approaches were insufficient to address the complex challenges posed by underwater political intrigue and the growing influence of mysterious deep-sea entities. The unit's authorized formation a secret council of Aethermoor's most senior leaders, who recognized the need for an asset capable of operating beyond traditional legal and ethical constraints when the survival of their world was at stake. ### Development

During the early years, the Crimson Hand operated primarily as an intelligence gathering unit, focusing on understanding Aquabyssos society and identifying key figures who could influence inter-world relations. As tensions escalated and more exotic threats emerged, the team's mandate expanded to include direct action capabilities, sabotage operations, and the neutralization of supernatural threats. The integration of magical enhancement techniques and reality-resistant conditioning allowed team members to operate in environments and against threats that would incapacitate or corrupt normal agents. This development phase established the team's reputation for accomplishing impossible missions. ### Current Era

The modern Crimson Hand operates at the cutting edge of military technology and magical capability, with access to experimental equipment and techniques not available to other Aethermoor forces. Recent operations have focused on containing the spread of crystal corruption, investigating deep-sea anomalies, and maintaining the delicate balance of power between Aethermoor and Aquabyssos. The team's current composition includes specialists in underwater operations, reality manipulation resistance, diplomatic assassination, and artifact containment, reflecting the diverse threats facing Aethermoor in the contemporary period. ### In Aquabyssos

While the general population of Aquabyssos remains unaware of the Crimson Hand's existence, certain intelligence networks have detected signs of their operations. These glimpses have created a mythology around mysterious Surface agents capable of extraordinary feats, leading to both respect and concern within Aquabyssos security circles. The few Aquabyssos officials who are aware of the team's existence view them as both a threat and a necessary balance to their own covert operations, creating a complex dynamic of mutual deterrence. ### In Aethermoor

Within Aethermoor, the Crimson Hand exists as a whispered legend among military circles, with most personnel believing them to be either fictional or highly exaggerated. This deliberate cultivation of ambiguity serves the unit's operational security while maintaining their psychological impact on potential threats. The team's successes are typically attributed to other causes or credited to different organizations, ensuring their continued invisibility while building their reputation among those who know the truth. ### Operation Depth Strike

A classified mission to neutralize a threat within Aquabyssos that conventional forces could not approach, demonstrating the team's unique capabilities. ### The Reality Breach Incident

The Crimson Hand's intervention prevented a catastrophic reality alteration event, though the full details remain classified at the highest levels. ### The Coral Gardens Extraction
