# Extended Spell
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 142. Available in the SRD*  

When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double its duration to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

If the affected spell requires [[conditions#Concentration|Concentration]], you have [[Advantage Xphb]] on any saving throw you make to maintain that [[conditions#Concentration|Concentration]].
