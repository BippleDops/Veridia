# Baldur's Gate Criminal

No career criminal in Baldur’s Gate operates without being aware of the Guild. Some studiously keep a low profile, carrying just the occasional smuggled load in with legitimate merchandise, or only breaking knees when it can plausibly be claimed as an act of personal revenge. Others join up with crews for protection, or with the Guild itself. A few former Guild members have been cast out of the organization due to incompetence or after offending a more powerful member, and now shuffle for scraps to survive.

You are an experienced criminal with a history of breaking the law. You have spent a lot of time among other criminals and still have contacts within the criminal underworld. You’re far closer than most people to the world of murder, theft, and violence that pervades the underbelly of civilization, and you have survived up to this point by flouting the rules and regulations of society.

- **Skill Proficiencies:** [[Deception]], [[Stealth]]
- **Tool Proficiencies:** One type of [[gaming set]], [[thieves’ tools]]
- **Equipment:** A crowbar, a set of dark common clothes including a hood, and a pouch containing 15 gp

| 1   | You crippled a Guild kingpin’s cousin without realizing the connection. You got the Guild to back off demands for your death by offering to make amends by working for the criminals, but even so the kingpin still plots a personal revenge.                                                                  |
| 2   | The Guild took over your family business, ran it into the ground, and burned the building for insurance money. You were driven into crime yourself, but you’ll never work for the Guild. You take special joy in hitting its targets first, tipping off its con victims and otherwise frustrating its schemes. |
| 3   | It’s always been about money. You’re not paid what you’re worth, working for someone who has more than they deserve. But the Guild offered you a way to fix that. You keep doing what you’ve always done — guard work, dock labor, business accounting — but what you learn you pass on to the Guild.          |
| 4   | The inequality of Baldur’s Gate has driven you to take matters into your own hands. You steal from patriars and rich Lower City residents, funneling the money through charitable fronts to help the needy.                                                                                                    |
| 5   | You got into crime as a bored patriar looking for excitement. Your family has no idea of your activities, and neither does the Guild. If either of them ever finds out, your life as you know it will be over.                                                                                                 |
| 6   | A close friend or relative joined the Guild and vanished mysteriously. You’ve worked your way into the lower ranks hoping to find out what happened to them.                                                                                                                                                   |
| 7   | You’ve always wanted to be a member of the Guild. As a child, you looked up to the Guild members’ swagger, their flashy dress, and their competence, which all marked them as different from the other adults you knew. As soon as you could, you joined the organization.                                     |
| 8   | To you, this is just a way to earn a living. You go to work, do what needs to be done, and get paid. Anyone who pursues crime for thrill-seeking, to strike back at unjust authorities, or anything else are amateurs, and they’re liable to get you arrested or killed with their idiocy.                     |
^Origins

## Feature: Criminal Contact

You have a reliable and trustworthy contact who acts as your liaison to a network of other criminals. You know how to get messages to and from your contact, even over great distances; specifically, you know the local messengers, corrupt caravan masters, and seedy sailors who can deliver messages for you.

## Feature: Criminal Connections

In Baldur’s Gate, crime is just another business. As a result, you can arrange a meeting with a low-ranking operative of nearly any business, patriar family, crew, government institution, or — certainly — the Guild. This operative will hear you out and, at their discretion, take your information or request up their chain of command. These meetings almost always occur in shady venues.

## Suggested Characteristics

Criminals might seem like villains on the surface, and many of them are villainous to the core. But some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. There might be honor among thieves, but criminals rarely show any respect for law or authority.

| 5   | I am incredibly slow to trust. Those who seem the fairest often have the most to hide.                                 |
| 6   | I don’t pay attention to the risks in a situation. Never tell me the odds.                                             |
| 7   | The best way to get me to do something is to tell me I can’t do it.                                                    |

| 3   | Charity. I steal from the wealthy so that I can help people in need. (Good)                                                   |
