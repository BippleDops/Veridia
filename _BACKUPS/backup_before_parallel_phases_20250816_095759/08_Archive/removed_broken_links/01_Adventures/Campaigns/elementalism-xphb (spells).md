Doors and shutters being held open by someone or something aren't affected. ## Beckon Earth You create a thin shroud of dust or sand that covers surfaces in a 5-foot-square area, or you cause a single word to appear in your handwriting in a patch of dirt or sand. ## Beckon Fire You create a thin cloud of harmless embers and colored, scented smoke in a 5-foot [Cube Area of Effect Xphb]]. You choose the color and scent, and the embers can light candles, torches, or lamps in that area. The smoke's scent lingers for 1 minute. ## Beckon Water You create a spray of cool mist that lightly dampens creatures and objects in a 5-foot [[Cube Area of Effect Xphb. Alternatively, you create 1 cup of clean water either in an open container or on a surface, and the water evaporates in 1 minute. ## Sculpt Element You cause dirt, sand, fire, smoke, mist, or water that can fit in a 1-foot [Cube Area of Effect Xphb]] to assume a crude shape (such as that of a creature) for 1 hour. ## Summary **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 267. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* ## Player-Facing Summary Elementalism xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of elementalism xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around elementalism xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Alliance - Manipulate succession ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Hidden Prophecy of Stars ## Plot Hooks - A shipment has gone missing and truth emerges
