# Net
*Adventuring gear*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/net.webp#right)

- **Cost**: 1 gp
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

When you take the [[actions#Attack|Attack]] action, you can replace one of your attacks with throwing a Net. Target a creature you can see within 15 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and [[proficiency-xphb|Proficiency Bonus]]) or have the [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition until it escapes. The target succeeds automatically if it is Huge or larger.

To escape, the target or a creature within 5 feet of it must take an action to make a DC 10 Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check, freeing the [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] creature on a success. Destroying the Net (AC 10; 5 HP; [[immunity-xphb|Immunity]] to Bludgeoning, Poison, and Psychic damage) also frees the target, ending the effect.

Legends speak of net xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around net xphb.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
