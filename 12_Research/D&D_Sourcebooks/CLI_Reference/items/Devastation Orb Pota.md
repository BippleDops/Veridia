# Devastation Orb
*Wondrous item, very rare*  



A devastation orb is an elemental bomb that can be created at the site of an elemental node by performing a ritual with an elemental weapon. The type of orb created depends on the node used. For example, an air node creates a [[devastation-orb-of-air-pota|devastation orb of air]]. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires 2,000 gp worth of special components, which are consumed.

A devastation orb measures 12 inches in diameter, weighs 10 pounds, and has a solid outer shell. The orb detonates `d100` hours after its creation, releasing the elemental energy it contains. The orb gives no outward sign of how much time remains before it will detonate. Spells such as [[identify-xphb|identify]] and [[divination-xphb|divination]] can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode. An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to explode instantly.

A special container can be crafted to contain a devastation orb and prevent it from detonating. The container must be inscribed with symbols of the orb's opposing element. For example, a case inscribed with earth symbols can be used to contain a [[devastation-orb-of-air-pota|devastation orb of air]] and keep it from detonating. While in the container, the orb thrums. If it is removed from the container after the time when it was supposed to detonate, it explodes `d6` rounds later, unless it is returned to the container.

Regardless of the type of orb, its effect is contained within a sphere with a 1 mile radius. The orb is the sphere's point of origin. The orb is destroyed after one use.
