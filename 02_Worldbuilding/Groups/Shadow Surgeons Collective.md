## Overview
The Shadow Surgeons Collective operates in the gray areas between medicine and crime, offering "therapeutic" memory modification to those who can pay.

## DM Notes

### Using the Shadow Surgeons

- **Psychological Horror**: Focus on identity and memory as sources of fear
- **Investigation Focus**: Crimes leave subtle clues requiring careful detection
- **Personal Stakes**: Make memory theft feel like a violation of character identity

### Balancing the Threat
- Memory modification should have limitations and side effects
- Provide ways for characters to detect and resist mental manipulation
- Show both positive and negative applications of memory surgery
- Give players agency in how to deal with this ethically complex organization

> [!danger] DM Secret
> The Silhouette Surgeon Prime is actually three different people sharing a single identity through memory synchronization. They take turns being "Prime" and have divided their original personalities among themselves to better run the organization. None of them remembers being a complete individual, and discovering this truth could either destroy the Collective or make them even more dangerous as they seek to become whole again.
