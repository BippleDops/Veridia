# Beholder

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing a beholder's lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Scopophobia.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair feel as if they're being watched. Any creature (excluding the beholder and its allies) that finishes a [Short Rest](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb.md) while within 1 mile of the lair must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or gain no benefit from that rest.  
- **Warping Terrain.** Minor warps in reality occur near the lair; any creature (excluding the beholder) within 1 mile of the lair that makes a [D20 Test](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb.md) and rolls a 1 has the [Prone](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Prone) condition.  

If the beholder dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

## Player-Facing Summary

Beholder xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of beholder xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around beholder xmm.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties beholder xmm to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at beholder xmm to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to beholder xmm active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
