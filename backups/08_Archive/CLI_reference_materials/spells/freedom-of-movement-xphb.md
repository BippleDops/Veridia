# Freedom of Movement
*4th-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a leather strap)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target's movement is unaffected by [Difficult Terrain](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md), and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target's [Speed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) nor cause the target to have the [Paralyzed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Paralyzed) or [Restrained](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Restrained) conditions. The target also has a [Swim Speed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/swim-speed-xphb.md) equal to its [Speed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md).

In addition, the target can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature imposing the [Grappled](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Grappled) condition on it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.

**Classes**: [Druid](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Ranger](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md); [Sorcerer (Clockwork Sorcery)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-clockwork-sorcery-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Paladin (Oath of Glory)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-glory-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Paladin (Oath of Devotion)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-devotion-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Cleric](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Druid (Circle of the Land)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-circle-of-the-land-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Cleric (War Domain)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-war-domain-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
