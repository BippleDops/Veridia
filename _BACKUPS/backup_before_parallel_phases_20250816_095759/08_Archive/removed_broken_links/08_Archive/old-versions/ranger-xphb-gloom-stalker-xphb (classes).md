You can use this benefit only once per turn, you can use it a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [long-rest-xphb]]. #### Initiative Bonus When you roll [[Initiative Xphb, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the roll. ### Gloom Stalker Spells (Level 3) When you reach a Ranger level specified in the Gloom Stalker Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared. **Gloom Stalker Spells** | Ranger Level | Spells |

^gloom-stalker-spells ### Umbral Sight (Level 3) You gain [[senses#Darkvision|Darkvision with a range of 60 feet. If you already have [senses#Darkvision|Darkvision]] when you gain this feature, its range increases by 60 feet. You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on [[senses#Darkvision|Darkvision. While entirely in [darkness-xphb (variant-rules)]], you have the [[conditions#Invisible|Invisible condition to any creature that relies on [senses#Darkvision|Darkvision]] to see you in that [[darkness-xphb (variant-rules). ### Iron Mind (Level 7) You have honed your ability to resist mind-altering powers. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice). ### Stalker's Flurry (Level 11) The Psychic damage of your Dreadful Strike becomes``dice: 2d8``. In addition, when you use the Dreadful Strike effect of your Dread Ambusher feature, you can cause one of the following additional effects. #### Sudden Strike You can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and that is within the weapon's range. #### Mass Fear The target and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature has the [conditions#frightened|Frightened]] condition until the start of your next turn. ### Shadowy Dodge (Level 15) When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can take a [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules) to impose [Advantage Xphb]] on that roll. Whether the attack hits or misses, you can then teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Ranger xphb gloom stalker xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
