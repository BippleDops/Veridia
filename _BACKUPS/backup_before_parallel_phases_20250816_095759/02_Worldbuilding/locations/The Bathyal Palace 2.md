# The Bathyal Palace - The Court of Currents

## Overview
Suspended in the open water at 2,800 feet depth, the Bathyal Palace is a massive structure of crystallized water and compressed pearl that serves as the neutral meeting ground for all major factions of [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Aquabyssos World Overview. Built on the site where the last surface kingdoms signed their final treaty before [02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Great Drowning]], it remains magically neutral territory where violence is supposedly impossible.

## Areas

### The Neutral Hall
A vast central chamber where faction representatives meet. The [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Bathyal Succession council convenes here, with each faction holding an equal voice. [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Mediator Serenity Stillwater]] facilitates negotiations with supernatural patience.

### The Embassy Ring
Circular arrangement of embassy suites, each maintained by different factions:
- [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Tethyan Hegemony suite (East)
- [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Coral Courts]] chambers (South)
- [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Depth Wardens quarters (North)
- [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Church of the Tidal Throne]] sanctuary (West)
- [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Free Current hidden rooms (location varies)

### The Archive of Accords
Library containing every treaty, agreement, and contract signed in the palace. [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Keeper of Contracts Minerva Bindingword]] ensures all agreements are magically enforced.

### The Depth Gardens
Floating gardens of cultivated kelp and coral where private negotiations occur. [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Garden Keeper Zen Currentdancer maintains the delicate ecosystem and "accidentally" overhears many secrets.

### The Observation Sphere
Transparent sphere at the palace's peak offering 360-degree views. Used for divination and watching for approaching threats or visitors.

## Notable Features

### The Peace Field
Magical barrier preventing all violence within the palace. Weapons become ethereal, and hostile magic simply fails. [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Enchanter Valdris Peacewarden]] maintains this ancient magic.

### The Speaking Pool
Scrying pool allowing communication with any location in Aquabyssos. Heavily monitored and restricted to official use.

### The Neutral Vault
Repository of disputed items held until ownership is resolved. Currently contains several artifacts including pieces of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Pressure Crown.

### The Treaty Stone
Original stone where the pre-drowning treaty was signed. Touching it while lying causes immediate expulsion from the palace.
