- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute Each Humanoid in a 20-foot-radius [[Area of Effect Xphb centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects (choose for each creature): - The creature has [immunity-xphb (variant-rules)]] to the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed and [conditions#frightened|Frightened]] conditions until the spell ends. If the creature was already [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed or [conditions#frightened|Frightened]], those conditions are suppressed for the duration. - The creature becomes [[indifferent-attitude-xphb (variant-rules) about creatures of your choice that it's [Hostile Attitude Xphb]] toward. This indifference ends if the target takes damage or witnesses its allies taking damage. When the spell ends, the creature's attitude returns to normal. **Classes**: [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 249.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of calm emotions xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around calm emotions xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is hunting an heir for money
