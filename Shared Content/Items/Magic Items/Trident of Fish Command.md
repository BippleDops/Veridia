## Description
This trident is a magic weapon. It has 3 charges. While you carry it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast [[dominate beast]] (save DC 15) from it on a beast that has an innate swimming speed. The trident regains `dice: 1d3` (1d3) expended charges daily at dawn.

**Thrown**. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

**Versatile**. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
