## Effects
- When you take the [[Attack]] action and attack with only a glaive, halberd, or quarterstaff, you can use a bonus action to make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon. The weaponâ€™s damage die for this attack is a `dice: 1d4` (1d4), and the attack deals bludgeoning damage.
