# Hornung's Random Dispatcher (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *8th-level*

**School**: *conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You point to one creature you can see within range. That creature must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the creature is hurtled into a completely random plane of existence. You have no control over which plane the target ends up going to, and it is entirely possible that the targetâ€™s destina-tion will instantly kill it. The GM should roll on the following table to randomly deter-mine the destination:
