You do one of the following:

- **Destroy Water.** You destroy up to 10 gallons of water in an open container within range. Alternatively, you destroy fog in a 30-foot [Cube](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) within range.  

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You create or destroy 10 additional gallons of water, or the size of the [Cube](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) increases by 5 feet, for each spell slot level above 1.
