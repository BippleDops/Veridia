## Description
You have [[17 - Damage and Healing|resistance]] to [[17 - Damage and Healing|fire]] damage while you hold this [[Staff|staff]].

The [[Staff|staff]] has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]]: **[[Burning Hands|burning hands]]** (1 charge), **[[Fireball|fireball]]** (3 charges), or **[[Wall of Fire|wall of fire]]** (4 charges).

The [[Staff|staff]] regains `dice: 1d6+4` (1d6+4) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff blackens, crumbles into cinders, and is destroyed.
