# Ivy Siege (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *9th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 150 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (an ivy leaf)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour


## Effects
Vines of ivy quickly grow over a struc-ture. The building must be attached to the ground; ships and flying castles are immune

Within ten minutes, the ivy has climbed all of the walls, and within twenty minutes, it has spread so thickly it is nearly impossible to see the building underneath.

Starting after one-hour hour, the ivy deepens in color to green-black and begins squeezing the walls, doing 3d10 bludgeoning damage every minute for the next thirty minutes. At the end of the hour, the ivy dies and begins to die.
