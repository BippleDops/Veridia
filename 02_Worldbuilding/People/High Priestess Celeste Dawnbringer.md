- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]] - Mysterious rival advisor
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/High Inquisitor Maltheos]] - Dangerous opposition
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Master Artificer Korvin Gearwright]] - Fellow conspirator

- [[The Luminous Dawn Cathedral]] - Her primary base
- [[Sacred Healing Gardens]] - Where she conducts treatments
- [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Crystal Throne]] - Royal palace connections

## The Secret Medical Protocol
### The Queen's Treatments
Every three days, in the hidden sanctuary beneath the cathedral, Celeste performs intensive healing sessions on [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]] to slow the progression of her crystal corruption.

### Treatment Components
- **Light Infusion**: Direct channeling of pure radiant energy into the queen's system
- **Purification Prayers**: Ancient rites that temporarily cleanse corrupted crystals
- **Soul Binding**: Celeste sacrifices portions of her own life force to strengthen the queen
- **Memory Modification**: Subtle divine magic to help the queen cope with the psychological effects
- **Symptom Suppression**: Magical techniques to hide visible signs of corruption

### The Hidden Toll
Each treatment session drains Celeste significantly:
- Loses 1d4 months of natural lifespan per major healing session
- Experiences increasing difficulty maintaining her own divine connection
- Suffers psychosomatic symptoms that mirror the queen's condition
- Growing dependence on the very crystal magic she's trying to cure

## The Sacred Keepers - Her Inner Circle
### Brother Marcus Lightward (Second-in-Command)
- **Background**: Former military chaplain who discovered the queen's secret by accident
- **Role**: Handles daily church operations while Celeste focuses on treatments
- **Personality**: Pragmatic, loyal, increasingly concerned about Celeste's deteriorating health
- **Secret Burden**: Knows the treatments are slowly killing Celeste but hasn't told her

### Sister Elena Starweaver (Medical Specialist)
- **Background**: Brilliant healer who developed many of the anti-corruption techniques
- **Role**: Chief researcher working on permanent cure for crystal corruption
- **Personality**: Obsessive, perfectionist, willing to take extreme risks for breakthrough
- **Hidden Agenda**: Secretly believes the queen should be allowed to die to protect the kingdom

### Acolyte Thomas Brightwater (The Innocent)
- **Background**: Young priest with exceptional healing gifts, unaware of full scope of conspiracy
- **Role**: Provides supplementary healing and serves as backup for emergencies
- **Personality**: Idealistic, compassionate, gradually becoming suspicious
- **Character Arc**: His discovery of the truth could expose or strengthen the conspiracy

### Mother Superior Catherine (The Wise)
- **Background**: Ancient nun who trained Celeste and remembers the kingdom before crystal magic
- **Role**: Spiritual advisor and keeper of historical knowledge
- **Personality**: Wise, patient, deeply concerned about the moral implications
- **Secret Knowledge**: Suspects [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]]'s true identity

## The Corruption Research Project
### Experimental Techniques
Celeste has developed several innovative approaches to treating crystal corruption:

**Solar Resonance Therapy**
- Uses concentrated sunlight channeled through blessed crystals
- Creates temporary immunity to corruption effects
- Requires rare components and perfect weather conditions
- Side effect: Patients develop light sensitivity

**Divine Essence Transfusion**
- Direct transfer of Celeste's own divine energy to patients
- Most effective treatment but extremely dangerous to caster
- Can cure early-stage corruption completely
- Risk: Could kill Celeste if overused

**Memory Palace Technique**
- Helps patients compartmentalize corruption-related trauma
- Allows them to function normally despite ongoing physical effects
- Requires ongoing maintenance sessions
- Danger: Suppressed memories could resurface violently

**Crystal Harmony Ritual**
- Attempts to "purify" corrupted crystals rather than destroy them
- Theoretical breakthrough that could revolutionize treatment
- Still in experimental phase with mixed results
- Opposition: [[02_Worldbuilding/People/High Inquisitor Maltheos]] would execute her if he knew

### Research Facilities
**The Hidden Sanctuary**
- Secret chamber beneath the cathedral accessible only to Sacred Keepers
- Contains the queen's medical records and treatment equipment
- Protected by layers of divine wards and misdirection magic
- Houses experimental corruption specimens for study

**The Light Laboratory**
- Disguised as a meditation chamber in the cathedral's upper levels
- Where Celeste develops and tests new healing techniques
- Contains dangerous experimental equipment and forbidden texts
- Regularly inspected by church hierarchy who remain oblivious to its true purpose

## Political Complexities
### The Church Hierarchy
Celeste must navigate complex relationships within her own organization:

**Cardinal Vincent Goldspire** - Northern dioceses leader who suspects her of heretical research
**Archbishop Helena Dawnfire** - Traditional conservative who opposes any deviation from orthodox healing
**Bishop Marcus Sunblade** - Military chaplain who could become powerful ally or dangerous enemy

### Government Relations
**[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Lord Commander Gareth Steelborn]]** - Knows something is wrong with the queen but hasn't confronted Celeste
**Royal Council Members** - Several are growing suspicious of the queen's inconsistent public appearances
**Parliament Leaders** - Some want to use any royal weakness for political advantage

### International Implications
**Foreign Ambassadors** - Have noticed changes in the queen's behavior and appearance
**Church Officials from Other Realms** - Could expose the conspiracy if they discover the truth
**Healing Orders Abroad** - Celeste maintains correspondence seeking cures, risking exposure

## Expanded Combat Statistics
*Medium humanoid (human), lawful good*

**Additional Abilities:**
**Desperate Healing (1/Day).** When an ally drops to 0 hit points, Celeste can immediately teleport to them and cast *heal* as a reaction, but takes 2d6 necrotic damage.

**Divine Sacrifice.** Celeste can choose to take damage intended for another creature within 30 feet. She has resistance to this damage but cannot reduce it below 1.

**Corruption Cleansing (3/Day).** Touch attack that removes crystal corruption effects. Target makes DC 18 Constitution save; success removes one corruption level, failure deals 4d8 radiant damage.

**Light Form (1/Day).** Celeste becomes a being of pure light for 1 minute. She gains flying speed 60 ft., immunity to physical damage, and all healing spells are maximized.

### Legendary Actions (Expanded)
- Cast *cure wounds* or *lesser restoration*
- Move and make a melee attack with radiant weapon
- Create 20-foot radius of *daylight* (costs 2 actions)

- Increasing reliance on divine magic to function normally
- Difficulty maintaining her public persona of serene confidence

**Spiritual Crisis:**
- Questions whether her deception violates her sacred oaths
- Wonders if she's enabling the queen's descent into corruption
- Fears that her lies have contaminated her connection to divine power

**Relationship Strain:**
- Cannot form genuine connections due to constant secret-keeping
- Feels isolated even among her closest allies
- Battles resentment toward the queen for putting her in this position
- Questions whether her sacrifice will ultimately matter

### The Breaking Point
Celeste is approaching a psychological crisis that could manifest in several ways:
- Complete mental breakdown that exposes all secrets
