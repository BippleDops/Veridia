## Overview
Lumengarde is a breathtaking city grown rather than built, formed from cultivated bioluminescent coral, kelp, and engineered organisms. Located in the Gloom Gardens at 1,200 feet depth, the city pulses with natural light in patterns that serve as both illumination and communication. The [[Coral Courts]] maintain their primary seat of power here, and the city is renowned for its biological magic and living architecture.

### The Radiant Core
The heart of Lumengarde, where the massive Mothercoral provides the template for all city growth. [[Duke Cyrus Reefheart]] holds court in the Coral Palace, a living structure that grows new rooms as needed.

### The Cultivation Terraces
Stepped growing fields where specialized farmers tend to bioluminescent crops and architectural organisms. [[Master Cultivator Thalia Greenglow]] oversees production and experimentation.

### The Symbiont Quarter
Residential area where inhabitants live in perfect symbiosis with their coral homes. [[Whisper-Witch Naia Softcurrent]] helps newcomers bond with living structures.

### The Enzyme Markets
Commercial district where biological products are traded. [[The Phosphor Markets]] maintain a permanent outpost here, managed by [[Merchant Delilah Currentrunner]]'s cousin.

### The Deep Garden
A darker section where dangerous but useful organisms are cultivated. [[Doctor Silas Voidtouch]] conducts controversial adaptation experiments here.

### The Singing Reef
A massive coral formation that resonates with tidal movements, creating hauntingly beautiful music. [[Siren Maeve Echoborn]] performs here, weaving magic into the natural harmonies.

### The Growth Cathedral
Temple dedicated to the living nature of the sea, where [[High Cultivist Jasper Lifebinder]] preaches the gospel of biological adaptation over mechanical preservation.

### The Spawn Pools
Nurseries where the city's living buildings begin their growth. Heavily guarded due to sabotage attempts by those opposing biological adaptation.

### The Luminous Library
A collection of knowledge stored in modified jellyfish that project information when touched. [[Archivist Vera Glowmind]] maintains this unique repository.

### The Adaptation Chambers
Medical facility where citizens undergo voluntary (and sometimes involuntary) biological modifications. Connected to the [[Abyssal Academy]]'s research.

### The Biolume Bazaar
Weekly market where rare organisms and biological materials are traded. Known for illegal sales of prohibited adaptations.

### Coral Shaper's Studio
[[Artisan Felix Reefwright]] sculpts living coral into tools, weapons, and art. Each piece continues growing after purchase.

### The Glowing Goblet
Tavern run by [[Barkeep Mira Algaebrew]], serves bioluminescent drinks that provide temporary enhancements. Popular with the [[Free Current]].

### Symbiont Solutions
[[Healer Sage Bondseer]] helps resolve conflicts between inhabitants and their living homes, also treats adaptation rejection.
