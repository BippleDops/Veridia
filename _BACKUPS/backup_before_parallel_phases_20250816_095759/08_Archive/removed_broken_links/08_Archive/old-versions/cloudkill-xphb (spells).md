--- # Cloudkill

*5th-level, Conjuration* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes You create a 20-foot-radius [[Area of Effect Xphb of yellow-green fog centered on a point within range. The fog lasts for the duration or until strong wind (such as the one created by [Gust of Wind Xphb]]) disperses it, ending the spell. Its area is [[Heavily Obscured Xphb. Each creature in the [Area of Effect Xphb]] makes a Constitution saving throw, taking``dice: 5d8``Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the [[Area of Effect Xphb moves into its space and when it enters the [Area of Effect Xphb]] or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn. The [[Area of Effect Xphb moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by`d8`for each spell slot level above 5. **Classes**: [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 251.
