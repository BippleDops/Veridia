The layout should be grid-based with intuitive controls, tracker for player initiative, spaces, and icons fashioned from parchment, metal, and wood motifs, all against a backdrop of an aquatic fantasy scene. Embody realistic undertones with subsurface light refractions and bioluminescent highlights. Dominant colors should be teal, deep blue, sea-green, with pearl accents. Keep the typography crisp and readable, adhering to WCAG 4.5:1 contrast. Use short, actual labels such as STR, DEX, HP, BAG, and MAP, or clean unlabeled slots. Stay clear of random characters and modern or sci-fi motifs. The image should have exceptional resolution and no visible artifacts.",
