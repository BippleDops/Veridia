# Simbul's Skeletal Deliquescence (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *8th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 week


## Effects
You touch a living creature, which must make a Constitution saving throw. If the saving throw fails, all of the creature’s bones turn to jelly for the duration.

The boneless creature can breathe, speak, and perceive, but its move is reduced to 5 feet and it can perform no other actions. The creature also gains resistance to bludgeoning weapons but vulnerability to piercing weapons.

When the spell expires, the creature’s bones grow back to normal.

Level ***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a 9th-level spell slot, the duration increases to 1 month.
