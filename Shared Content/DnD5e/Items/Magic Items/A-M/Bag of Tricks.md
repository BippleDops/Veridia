## Description

This ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag weighs 1/2 pound.

You can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag’s color. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.

The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a [[12 - The Order of Combat|bonus action]] to [[Command|command]] how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its [[Intelligence|nature]].

Once three fuzzy [[11 - Objects|objects]] have been pulled from the bag, the bag can’t be used again until the next dawn.
