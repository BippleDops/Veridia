# Nondetection
*3rd-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust worth 25+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** 8 hours

For the duration, you hide a target that you touch from Divination spells. The target can be a willing creature, or it can be a place or an object no larger than 10 feet in any dimension. The target can't be targeted by any Divination spell or perceived through magical scrying sensors.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of nondetection xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around nondetection xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties nondetection xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
