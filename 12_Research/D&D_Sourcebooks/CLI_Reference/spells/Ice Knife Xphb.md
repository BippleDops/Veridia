# Ice Knife
*1st-level, Conjuration*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/ice-knife.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a drop of water or a piece of ice)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `d10` Piercing damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take `2d6` Cold damage.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The Cold damage increases by `d6` for each spell slot level above 1.
