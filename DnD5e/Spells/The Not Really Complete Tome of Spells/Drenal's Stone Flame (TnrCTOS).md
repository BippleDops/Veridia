# Drenal's Stone Flame (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a fix of fine sand and sugar, which is thrown in the air)

**Duration**: 10 minutes


## Effects
You point at an open flame no larger than a torch, and the flame turns into a cool but brightly-glowing orange stone in the shape of the flame. It can then be picked up and carried without harm, although it remains attached to the torch if that was the source of the flame. When the spell expires, the stone reverts to flame. If the stone is shattered, it extinguishes the flame.
