## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting (1/Day).*** The mephit can innately cast fog cloud, requiring no material components. Its innate spellcasting ability is Charisma.

***Death Burst.*** When the mephit dies, it explodes in a burst of jagged ice. Each creature within 5 ft. of it must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (`dice: 1d8`) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***False Appearance.*** While the mephit remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary shard of ice.

## Actions
***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 3 (`dice: 1d4+1`) slashing damage plus 2 (`dice: 1d4`) cold damage.

***Frost Breath (Recharge 6).*** The mephit exhales a 15-foot cone of cold air. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5 (`dice: 2d4`) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Variant: Summon Mephits (1/Day).*** The mephit has a 30% summoning chance chance of summoning `dice: 1d4` mephits of its kind. A summoned mephit appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other mephits. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

## Description
Comprising frigid air and water, ice mephits are aloof and cold, surpassing all other mephits in pitiless cruelty
