# Seal Mouth (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 hour


## Effects
You target a creature within range that is capable of speech. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, that creature cannot say anything insulting, critical, or otherwise defamatory or disparaging about youâ€”if the target tries, its lips seal shut. You can end this spell at any time, and a *remove curse* is also effective.
