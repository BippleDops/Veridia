| 1 | The adventurers confront a villain and a group of minions in a battle to the finish. |
| 2 | The adventurers chase a villain while dodging obstacles designed to thwart them, leading to a final confrontation in the villain's refuge. |
| 3 | The actions of the adventurers or a villain result in a cataclysmic event that the adventurers must escape. |
| 4 | The adventurers race to the site where a villain is bringing a master plan to its conclusion, arriving just as that plan is about to be completed. |
| 5 | A villain and two or three lieutets perform separate rites in a large room. The adventurers must disrupt all the rites. |
| 6 | An ally betrays the adventurers as they're about to achieve their goal. (Use this climax carefully, and don't overuse it.) |
| 7 | A portal opens to another plane of existence. Creatures on the other side spill out, forcing the adventurers to close the portal while dealing with a villain at the same time. |
| 8 | The dungeon begins to collapse while a villain attempts to escape in the chaos. |
| 9 | The adventurers must choose whether to pursue a fleeing villain or save an NPC they care about or a group of innocents. |
| 10 | Just when the characters think the main threat is defeated, it transforms into a different monster or a more powerful form. |
