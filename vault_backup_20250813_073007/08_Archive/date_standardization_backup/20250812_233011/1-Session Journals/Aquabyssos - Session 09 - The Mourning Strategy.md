# Session 9: The Mourning Strategy
## Into the Heart of Sorrow

> *"In the deepest depths, sorrow becomes power, power becomes purpose, and purpose becomes sacrifice."*

## üé¨ Strong Start
The party descends into [[The Mourning Depths]] to find it transformed‚Äîinstead of a city of sorrow, it's erupting with impossible joy. Citizens laugh while crying blood, dance while their bodies decay, celebrate while reality collapses. The [[The Sorrowmaster|Sorrowmaster]] floats above, glowing with paradoxical happiness: "I've discovered the ultimate sorrow‚Äîthe grief of never being able to grieve again. Help me. Kill my joy before it destroys everything."

## üé≠ Scenes

### Scene 1: The Cathedral of Sighs Inverted

**Situation**: Navigate through forced joy plague  
**Conflict**: Happiness is literally deadly here  
**Discoveries**:
- Joy and sorrow are two sides of Singer digestion
- The Sorrowmaster weaponized their own paradox
- Every laugh erases a memory of sadness
- The Grief Bomb needs pure, undiluted sorrow

**Joy Plague Mechanics**:
- **CON Save DC 16** or laugh uncontrollably
- Laughing deals 1d6 psychic damage per round
- Must find ways to maintain sorrow
- Critical fails cause permanent joy (death)

- Ancient grief from pre-Cataclysm still exists

**Sorrow Economics**:

- Shadows volunteer to be ammunition
- The Emperor reveals he IS multiple people
- Marina's versions offer collective solution

**The Council Vote**:
- Who delivers the bomb into Singer consciousness
- Which timeline to preserve if successful
- Whether to save shadows or originals
- How much of reality to sacrifice

### Scene 4: The Sorrowmaster's Ascension

**Situation**: Transform Sorrowmaster into delivery system  
**Conflict**: Must make them sad enough to function  
**Discoveries**:

## üé™ Cliffhanger Ending
The Grief Bomb is complete‚Äîa crystallized sphere of pure, concentrated sorrow from millions of beings across centuries. The Sorrowmaster, transformed into a living delivery system, prepares to ascend into the Singer's consciousness.

But as the ritual completes, the Singer Beyond SPEAKS through reality itself: "I... remember... feeling. You tiny things... you still feel. I consumed twelve realities seeking what you have. Give me your sorrow. Give me your joy. Give me... meaning."

The [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Scattered Emperor|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Scattered Emperor]], unified for the first time in centuries, steps forward: "We were never fighting it. We were trying to teach it. The Cataclysm, the shadows, the harvest‚Äîall of it was to show a god how to grieve."

[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Shadow Duchess Nyx|02 Worldbuilding/People/Shadow Duchess Nyx]] and her original self merge: "The bomb won't kill it. It will make it mortal. It will make it capable of death. And then..."

Marina‚Äîall versions speaking in unison‚Äîcompletes the thought: "And then we decide if a god deserves mercy."

The Sorrowmaster looks to the party: "The choice is yours. Detonate the bomb and make the Singer mortal but traumatized, or try to teach it empathy first. But choose quickly‚Äîreality has about ten minutes before complete digestion."

The ocean above turns transparent, revealing the impossible anatomy of the Singer Beyond. Its eyes‚Äîif they can be called that‚Äîfocus on the party. It whispers through dimensions: "Please. I just want to understand what it means to exist."
