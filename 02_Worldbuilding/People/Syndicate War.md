# Syndicate War

![[04_Resources/Assets/Art/NPCs/Syndicate_War.png|Syndicate War Portrait]]

## Role and Motive
Syndicate War moves information and influence like currency. Publicly pragmatic, privately driven by a personal stake in the Convergence’s shape.

- Ideal: Stability through controlled risk.
- Bond: A family archive tied to [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Sunken Library of Thalassius]].
- Flaw: Overconfidence in leverage; underestimates zealots and true believers.

## Tactics and Traits
- Conversational Disarm: First parley each day imposes disadvantage on Insight checks to read their tells.
- Ledger of Debts: Knows a favor owed by agents linked to [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]].
- Contingency: Keeps a sealed route toward [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]] if negotiations sour.

## For the Table (Use Now)
- Opening Line: “Prices rise with fear; calm your breath and we can afford the truth.”
- Quick Offers: passage papers, rumor bundles, bonded cargo, introductions to a discreet artificer.
- Failure Still Progresses: Even when rebuffed, Syndicate War sends a warning of a raid that creates a time-sensitive window.

## Relationships (score -3..+3)
- Pearl Guard customs captain: 0 (mutual irritation)
- Coral Throne Syndicate quartermaster: +2 (profitable ties)
- Verdant Accord observer: -1 (ideological friction)

## Hooks to the Main Campaign
- Offers a map shard pointing toward [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Sunken Library of Thalassius]].
- Brokers a ceasefire to enable [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]].
- Sells a rumor naming [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]] as the true buyer behind a recent theft.

## Player-Facing Summary

Syndicate War is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Syndicate War as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Syndicate War.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Syndicate War to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at Syndicate War to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to Syndicate War active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
