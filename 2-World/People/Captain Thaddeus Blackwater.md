# Captain Thaddeus Blackwater
*The Lost Explorer, Seeker of Truth*

## Overview
Captain Thaddeus Blackwater was [[2-World/Places/Aethermoor]]'s most famous explorer before his expedition vanished in [[2-World/Places/The Crystalline Wastes]] two months ago. Secretly funded by [[2-World/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]] to find the Seventh Shard, he discovered something that changed everything—but his final message was cut short.

## Appearance
- **Age**: 45
- **Build**: Weathered, strong
- **Hair**: Gray-black, salt-and-pepper beard
- **Eyes**: Sea green, intense
- **Clothing**: Practical explorer's gear
- **Distinguishing marks**: Crystal burn scars on hands
- **Equipment**: Crystal-resistant suit (experimental)

## Personality
- **Traits**: Curious, brave, methodical, obsessive
- **Ideals**: Knowledge should be shared, truth matters
- **Bonds**: Loyalty to his crew above all
- **Flaws**: Takes unnecessary risks for discovery

## Background
- Former naval officer under [[Admiral Cassandra Stormwind]]
- Lost family to crystal corruption
- Became obsessed with finding cure
- Led seven successful expeditions
- Discovered three pre-Shattering ruins

## The Final Expedition

### The Crew (All Missing)
- **First Mate Sarah Ironwind**: Navigator and survivor
- **Dr. Marcus Feldstone**: Crystal researcher
- **Brother Timothy**: Purist Coalition observer
- **Kasha Nightwhisper**: Elven guide
- **Six others**: Various specialists

### The Mission
> [!warning] DM Only
> Queen Seraphina secretly hired him to find the Seventh Shard, providing:
> - Map from [[2-World/People/The Crimson Sage]]
> - Crystal-resistant equipment
> - 50,000 gold pieces funding
> - Royal writs of passage

### The Route
1. Started from [[2-World/Places/Crystalhaven]]
2. Resupplied at Wanderer's Refuge
3. Entered deep wastes
4. Last camp found at Mirror Lakes
5. Trail ends at Corruption's Heart

## The Discovery

### Final Message (Partial)
*"Day 47... found it... not what we expected... the singing... it's alive... God help us, the Sage was right... the crown never broke, it was planted... sending coordinates... if we don't return, do NOT—"* [Message ends]

### What He Found
> [!warning] DM Only - The Truth
> Discovered the Seventh Shard moves through the crystal network like a living thing. Found evidence that the Crystallization was intentional—Aetheron planned his own shattering. The expedition is alive but transformed, serving as guardians for something at Corruption's Heart.

## Current Status

### Three Possibilities
1. **Dead**: Killed by corruption or creatures
2. **Transformed**: Crystallized but conscious
3. **Hidden**: Found something requiring them to hide

### Evidence Found
- Abandoned camps with signs of hasty departure
- Journal pages scattered by wind
- Crystal formations spelling "STAY AWAY"
- Crew member's equipment, no bodies
- Strange singing from crystals near their route

## His Research

### Journal Entries (Found)
- Theory that Shards are conscious
- Map to three possible Shard locations
- Notes on corruption resistance
- Sketches of pre-Shattering architecture
- References to "The Cage of Stars"

### Hidden Cache
> [!warning] DM Only
> Left supply caches with information:
> - Location 1: Warning about [[2-World/People/The Crimson Sage]]
> - Location 2: Partial cure for corruption
> - Location 3: Map to the Seventh Shard's pattern
