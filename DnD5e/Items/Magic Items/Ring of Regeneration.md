## Description
While wearing this ring, you regain `dice: 1d6` (1d6) hit points every 10 minutes, provided that you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part, the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full functionality after `dice: 1d6+1` (1d6+1) days if you have at least 1 hit point the whole time.
