# Trap #34 - "Did Some One Mention Poison Gas?"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> After the beauty of the last trap the childish simplicity of this next one is almost embarrassing. Upon reaching the coffin the party will find that it has a lid that is almost indistinguishable from the base. The stone from which the coffin is carved is unlike any you have ever seen. Even a dwarf will be hard pressed to remember any like it. The stone is rare and of great inherent value, perhaps as much as 15,000 g.p. delivered in useable condition. A dwarf, if present, will have a 60% chance to identify it as having been quarried on the long lost continent of Hy-atlan, sunk beneath the sea millennia ago during the myth-shrouded Age of Upheaval. This stone's like is found nowhere else in the world today.
> 
> This is all very nice and will serve to cloud the issue. Once the party summons up the courage to open the lid they will release the trap mechanism.
> 
> Simply put, once the lid is moved a piston that fills the base of the coffin begins to push upward forcing out of the long deep shaft within a heavier than air toxic cloud. Even attempting to put the lid back in place will not stop the outflow for long. The piston will simply continue until the pressure build up is sufficient to displace the lid. The gas will begin to build up and spill out over the floor. If the party left [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] open it will not reach higher than the delvers ankles. If the door was left closed then the room will eventual! y fill. This will kill any remaining bees, and any air breathing members of the party.
> 
> There is a 90% chance (L2) of any one member of the party reaching the door and opening it, this will diminish by 10% for each passing minute until the point of 0% chance then the party will be beyond caring if the doors are open or closed.
> 
> If by some miracle there are non-air breathing members of the tomb robbing team, or they get the door open they will find no treasure inside the coffin.
> 
> The gas trap is a one skuller, unless the party is made up of real boneheads.
