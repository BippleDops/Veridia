# Primal Savagery
You channel primal magic to cause your teeth or fingernails to sharpen, ready to deliver a corrosive attack. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes `dice: 1d10|avg` (1d10) acid damage. After you make the attack, your teeth or fingernails return to normal.

The spell's damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (`dice: 2d10|avg` (2d10)), 11th level (`dice: 3d10|avg` (3d10)), and 17th level (`dice: 4d10|avg` (4d10)).
