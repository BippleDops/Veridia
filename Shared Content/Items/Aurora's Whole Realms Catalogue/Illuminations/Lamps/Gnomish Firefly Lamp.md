## Description
Gnomish [[Lamps|lamps]] have recently become popular at parties held by the nobility in Waterdeep, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, Suzail, and Arabel. This odd, basket-like device of wire mesh, when whirled on its [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items for Dungeons & Dragons 5e SRD/Chain|chain]] in the woods, catches fireflies. The captured fireflies provide an eye-catching but feeble glow, and are prevented from [[Escaping|escaping]] when the lid is lowered. The [[Lamps|lamps]] are often hung about a room or from [[Poles|poles]] or trees in a garden to provide atmosphere. If the fireflies are not released at the end of an evening, they die. Those with a tender heart should remember to complete this task before going to bed after a jolly night of carousing. (9 sp)

## Additional Details
Provides no real useful illumination, but does not generate heat that would cause problems with infravision either.
