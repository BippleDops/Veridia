## Description
This lantern is gyroscope or other affixed to a heavy leather headband which is adjustable. It somewhat resembles a gnomish or dwarven artifact in that it consists of a series of half circles of formed wood which pivot within each other to allow the weighted bowl of the lantern to remain ever upright, no matter what position the wearer is in. The lantern is constructed so as to make it virtually impossible to involuntarily douse the lantern's flame or to catch the wearer or his clothing or supplies alight (20 gp).

## Additional Details
Illuminates a funnelled area 30 feet long, with an addition 5 feet of semidarkness. A spelunkerâ€™s lantern burns three hours per half-pint oil, and holds one half-pint.
