## Description
If you’ve got a heavy writing load, we’ve got the pens for you. Our quill pens are cut from the finest goose feathers, or, if you want the tools the serious professionals use, we also import [[Metal|metal]] nibs from Kara-Tur. We have several nib sizes and styles to choose from, for everything from basic writing to calligraphy, and even forgery pens. A case of 50 quill pens is 2 gp. In [[Metal|metal]] nibs, we have a set of five of any one size for 12 gp. Or, you may want our new deluxe package, which offers two or three of every size and style, depending on frequency of use, of every nib we have (32-nib kit, 14 different types), for 70 gp.

## Additional Details
If Non-weapon proficiencies are used, a forgery pen will give a + 2 bonus to an attempted “Forgery,” added to the character’s Dexterity score.
