# INV-005

*"The fifth investigation that no one talks about, but everyone remembers."*

## Overview
INV-005 represents the most sensitive and classified investigation conducted by inter-realm authorities, dealing with evidence of external entities attempting to manipulate events in both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. This case remains officially ongoing with most details sealed under the highest security classifications, though its implications continue to influence policy decisions.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
- Ultra-high security clearance from both realm governments
- Specialized investigation team with cross-dimensional experience
- Advanced magical detection and protection equipment
- Strict information compartmentalization protocols

### Effects
- **Security Heightening**: Increased protective measures across both realms
- **Policy Changes**: Fundamental shifts in inter-realm cooperation
- **Ongoing Investigation**: Active case requiring continued resources
- **Classification Challenges**: Information sharing restrictions

### Duration
Ongoing investigation with no projected completion date.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Security Breach**: Information about INV-005 is leaked or stolen
2. **New Evidence**: Characters discover clues relevant to the investigation
3. **External Contact**: Possible evidence of the entities being investigated

 ## Secrets (DM Only)
INV-005 has uncovered evidence of entities from outside both known realms attempting to destabilize the dimensional barriers for unknown purposes.

## Campaign Use
Provides background for high-level conspiracy storylines and justifies increased security measures in both realms.

## Player-Facing Summary

INV 005 is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of INV 005 as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around INV 005.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
