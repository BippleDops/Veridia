2. Add complication ("...AND you notice her eyes briefly flash purple")
3. Build tension ("AND she seems to be fighting against something")

### The Three Truths Technique
For any improvised NPC, quickly decide:
1. What they want most
2. What they fear most
3. What they're hiding

Example:
- Wants: To feed their family
- Fears: The guard captain
- Hiding: They're a reformed thief

### The Opposite Method
Take the expected and reverse it:
- Intimidating guard → Philosophical poet
- Greedy merchant → Secret philanthropist
- Wise elder → Completely senile
- Innocent child → Criminal mastermind

## Dialogue Formulas

### Information Delivery
**The Three-Part Response**:
1. Acknowledge the question
2. Provide partial information

Example:
1. "Ah, you seek the Crystal Depths?"
2. "Yes, I know the way. Through the Pressure Maze."
3. "But none return unchanged. Are you prepared for that?"

### Quest Giving Formula
1. **Problem Statement**: "The lighthouse has gone dark"
2. **Personal Stakes**: "My daughter tends it alone"
3. **Urgency Factor**: "Storm's coming in three hours"
4. **Complication**: "The rocks are haunted at night"
