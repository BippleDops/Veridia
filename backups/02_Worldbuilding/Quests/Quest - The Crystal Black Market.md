# Quest: The Crystal Black Market

## Overview
A new drug called "Shard Dust" is flooding the streets—powdered crystal that grants temporary magical abilities but accelerates corruption. Someone has established an industrial-scale operation to harvest and process crystal corruption from living victims. The operation threatens to destabilize the entire economy while creating an army of crystal-addicted servants.

## Quest Hook
[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Castellan Ironledger III]] contacts the party discretely. Three of his best informants have died investigating the Shard Dust trade, and his normal business operations are being undermined by this new economy. He offers substantial payment and future favors for dismantling the operation—but warns that powerful people are involved.

## Act 1: Following the Money

### The Ironledger Briefing
**What Castellan Knows:**
- Shard Dust appeared six weeks ago
- Users gain temporary magical abilities (random effects)
- Addiction is instant, corruption follows within days
- Street price has dropped 80% (suggests mass production)
- His competitor [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]] denies involvement

**Initial Payment:**
- 500 gp advance
- Access to Ironledger information network
- Temporary merchant credentials (for cover)
- Contact in Port Meridian quarantine zone

### Street Level Investigation

**Port Meridian Quarantine Zone:**
- Shard Dust dealers operate openly here
- Users show varying stages of crystal corruption
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Marcus Shardbreaker Grimm]] hunting corrupted addicts
- Guards are taking bribes to ignore the trade

**Following a Dealer:**
- Street dealers don't know their suppliers
- Dead drops in specific locations
- Payment via anonymous crystal credit tokens
- Leads to warehouse in the docks district

**The First Warehouse:**
- Contains processing equipment but no raw materials
- Alchemical setup created by expert artificer
- Shipping manifests with coded destinations
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Master Artificer Korvin Gearwright]]'s maker's mark on equipment (hidden)

## Act 2: The Processing Centers

### The Quarantine Hospital Connection
**Discovery:**
- Corrupted patients are disappearing from hospitals
- Official records show them as "deceased"
- Bodies supposedly burned to prevent spread
- Night staff report unusual Crystal Warden activities

**The Harvesting Operation:**
- Secret basement beneath Quarantine Hospital
- Living corrupted victims kept in stasis
- Crystal growths surgically harvested repeatedly
- Victims kept barely alive to continue producing

**The Moral Dilemma:**
- Victims beg for death
- Some volunteer, paid to support families
- Guards claim it's mercy compared to full transformation
- Evidence points to official sanction

### The Sunken Markets Laboratory

**Underwater Processing:**
- [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Sunken Markets]] hidden facility
- Aquabyssos technology enhances refinement
- Deep-dweller workers immune to corruption
- Producing "Pure Shard" - more potent variant

**The Overseer:**
- Crimson-scaled sahaugin alchemist named Vorthak
- Claims to work for "surface interests"
- Has been sending samples to Aquabyssos
- Knows location of main distribution center

### The Distribution Network

**Multiple Channels:**
1. **Street Level:** Through existing drug networks
2. **Noble Markets:** Disguised as "enhancement elixirs"
3. **Military Supplies:** Mixed into healing potions
4. **International Trade:** Hidden in legitimate shipments

**Key Discovery:**
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Captain Lyanna Brightshield]] has been investigating independently
- She's identified pattern in Crystal Warden patrol routes
- Certain shipments never get inspected
- Someone high in government is protecting operation

## Act 3: The Crystal Cartel

### The True Operation
> [!warning] DM Secret
> [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Lord Commander Gareth Steelborn]] is running the operation, believing he's creating an army immune to corruption. He's been corrupted by proximity to the Queen and thinks this is the only way to maintain order as society collapses.

**The Command Structure:**
- **Production:** Master Artificer Korvin (blackmailed)
- **Distribution:** Corrupted Crystal Wardens
- **Street Operations:** Criminal organizations
- **Protection:** Lord Commander's authority
- **Finance:** Diverted military funds

### The Central Facility

**Location:** Abandoned Crystal Warden fortress outside Crystalhaven
- Converted into massive processing plant
- Hundreds of corrupted victims in harvesting chambers
- Experimental lab creating new variants
- Armory of crystal-enhanced weapons

**Security:**
- Elite Crystal Wardens (corrupted but disciplined)
- Crystal constructs powered by Shard Dust
- Automated defenses using crystal technology
- Lord Commander Gareth present during final confrontation

### The Confrontation

**Lord Commander's Justification:**
- Shows reports of corruption spreading faster
- Demonstrates Shard Dust soldiers' effectiveness
- Argues controlled corruption better than chaos
- Reveals Queen ordered him to find solution

**Options:**
1. **Combat:** Fight through facility, destroy operation
2. **Negotiation:** Convince him of operation's evil
3. **Takeover:** Claim operation for "better" purposes
4. **Exposure:** Gather evidence, bring to authorities

## Possible Outcomes

### Operation Destroyed
- Shard Dust supply ends within days
- Addicts suffer fatal withdrawal
- Power vacuum in criminal underworld
- Crystal Wardens' reputation destroyed

### Operation Exposed
- Public scandal rocks government
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]] denies knowledge
- Lord Commander imprisoned or flees
- Reforms to Crystal Warden oversight

### Operation Continues (Modified)
- Party takes control or influences direction
- Can attempt to create safer version
- Moral complexity of managing drug trade
- Constant threat of discovery

## Rewards

### From Castellan Ironledger III
- 3,000 gp completion payment
- Permanent discount on information (50% off)
- Three favors (no questions asked)
- Hidden cache location with rare items

### Evidence Value
- Blackmail material on government officials
- Crystal Warden patrol schedules and codes
- Master Artificer's research notes
- Map of all processing sites

### Confiscated Resources
- Crystal-enhanced weapons and armor
- Alchemical equipment and formulas
- Shard Dust supply (dangerous to keep)
- Crystal suppression technology

### Potential Allies
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Marcus Shardbreaker Grimm]] (if helped with victims)
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Captain Lyanna Brightshield]] (if given evidence)
- Reformed criminals seeking redemption
- Families of victims (gratitude or revenge)

## Complications

### The Addicts' Plight
- Thousands addicted citywide
- Withdrawal is fatal without treatment
- Limited medical resources
- Public panic if supply ends suddenly

### The Protection Racket
- Other criminal organizations want the operation
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]] makes competitive offer
- Corrupt officials threaten party
- International buyers demand continuity

### The Aquabyssos Angle
- Deep-dwellers claim partial ownership
- Threaten to flood Port Meridian if disrupted
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Nerida Deepcurrent]] offers mediation
- Evidence of larger invasion preparation

## NPC Motivations

### Castellan Ironledger III
- Genuinely wants operation stopped (bad for business)
- Also gathering intelligence for personal gain
- Will betray party if offered better deal

### Marcus "Shardbreaker" Grimm
- Wants to save victims if possible
- Knows some addicts personally
- Struggling with own corruption

### Captain Lyanna Brightshield
- Seeks justice regardless of cost
- Won't accept coverup or compromise
- Potential powerful ally or obstacle

### Lord Commander Gareth Steelborn
- Believes he's saving the kingdom
- Corruption affecting judgment
- Can potentially be redeemed

## DM Notes
This quest explores the corruption of previously noble institutions and the moral complexity of the "greater good" argument. It provides opportunities for investigation, combat, and difficult moral choices with no perfect solutions. The Shard Dust epidemic can become an ongoing campaign element, and the revelations about government corruption can trigger larger political upheavals. The quest connects multiple NPCs and factions while introducing personal stakes through the victims and addicts encountered.
