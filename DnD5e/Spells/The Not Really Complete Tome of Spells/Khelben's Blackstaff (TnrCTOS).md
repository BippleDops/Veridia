## Effects
One nonmagical staff, club, or pierce of wood you touch begins to shimmer with black, crawling light. For the duration of this spell, the staff’s wielder (who is either you or someone who was holding the staff when you cast the spell) has advantage on attacks with it and on a hit, it inflicts 2d6 bludgeoning damage 4d8 necrotic damage. It cannot be used to harm you or the designated wielder. The staff is also completely immune to any magic cast upon it, with the exception of *wish* and *antimagic shell*.

In addition, each round, the staff inflicts one option from the following list, wielder’s choice:

♦ On a successful attack that inflicts necrotic damage, the wielder regains 2d8 hit points.

♦ On a successful attack, the staff casts *dispel magic* on the target. The *dispel magic* acts as if it was cast using a 6th-level spell slot. ♦ The target must make a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the blackstaff’s wielder for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

♦ The target must make a Wisdom sav-ing throw or become confused. It can’t take reactions, and must roll a d8 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn: **d8 Behavior**

1-3 The creature doesn’t move or take actions this turn.

4-6 The creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach

7-8 The creature can act and move normally

♦ The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

♦ The target complete forgets all cantrips and 1st-level spells they he or she knows, if any. The target will not be able to recast those spells until after a short or long rest.

♦ The target is assaulted by terrifying images and takes 4d6 psychic damage, and be at disadvantage on all Intelligence and Charisma saving throws for the remainder of the spell’s duration.

♦ If the target is a spellcaster, it forgets one prepared spell, chosen at random. If the target has innate spellcasting, it loses the ability to cast one of its spells until it takes a long rest.
