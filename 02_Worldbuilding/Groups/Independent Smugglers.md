# Independent Smugglers
*The Free Current Traders, Masters of the Grey Market, Lords of the Deep Routes*

## Overview
The Independent Smugglers represent a loose confederation of opportunistic traders who operate in the dangerous spaces between [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]. Unlike organized crime syndicates, they maintain their independence while sharing information, resources, and protection. They fill the crucial economic niche of moving goods that both realms need but officially prohibit, making them simultaneously essential and outlawed by both governments.
