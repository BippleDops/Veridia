# The Forgotten Representative

*"I speak for those whose voices have been silenced, whose names have been erased, whose sacrifices have been forgotten by history's convenient revision."*

## Overview

The Forgotten Representative is a mysterious figure who claims to speak for the countless individuals whose contributions to Aquabyssos have been erased from official records or deliberately forgotten. This enigmatic person appears at public gatherings, political meetings, and civic ceremonies to remind audiences of overlooked sacrifices, unacknowledged builders, and marginalized communities whose work made the city possible.

No one knows the Representative's true identity, as they appear wearing a simple mask made of coral fragments and speak in a voice that seems to carry the weight of collective memory. Their knowledge of obscure historical details and forgotten events is encyclopedic, suggesting either extensive research or supernatural connection to the city's suppressed past.

## Appearance

The Forgotten Representative appears as a figure of average height wearing simple, well-worn clothing that could belong to any era of the city's history. Their most distinctive feature is a coral-fragment mask that covers their entire face, with empty eye sockets that seem to hold depths of ancient sorrow.

Their voice carries strange harmonics, as if multiple people were speaking simultaneously. They move with quiet dignity and always carry a small, weathered book that contains names, dates, and stories of the forgotten.

## Current Activities

The Representative has become increasingly active during the current political crisis, appearing at faction meetings to remind leaders of past promises they've broken and communities they've abandoned. Their interventions often force uncomfortable reckonings with historical injustices that contribute to current tensions.

They seem particularly focused on ensuring that any resolution to the crisis acknowledges the contributions and sacrifices of marginalized groups whose voices might otherwise be overlooked in peace negotiations.

## Quest Hooks
1. The Representative approaches the party with evidence of historical injustices that might hold the key to resolving current conflicts.
2. Someone is trying to silence the Representative permanently, and the party must investigate who wants certain memories to remain buried.
3. The Representative asks the party to help recover stolen historical records that could vindicate forgotten heroes.

## DM Notes
Use the Forgotten Representative to introduce historical complexity to current events and to remind players that their actions will be remembered by future generations. They serve as a conscience for the campaign, ensuring that moral choices have weight and that the costs of decisions are acknowledged.
