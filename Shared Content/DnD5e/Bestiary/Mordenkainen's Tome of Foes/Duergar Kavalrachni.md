## Special Traits
***Cavalry Training.*** When the duergar hits a target with a melee attack while mounted on a [[Female Steeder|female steeder]], the steeder can make one melee attack against the same target as a reaction.

***Duergar Resilience.*** The duergar has advantage on saving throws against poison, spells, and illusions, as well as to resist being charmed or paralyzed.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the duergar has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The duergar makes two war pick attacks.

***War Pick.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ( `dice: 1d8+2`) piercing damage plus 5 ( `dice: 2d4`) poison damage.

***Heavy Crossbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. Hit: 5 ( `dice: 1d10`) piercing damage.

***Shared Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The duergar magically turns invisible for up to 1 hour or until it attacks, it casts a spell, or its concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the duergar wears or carries is invisible with it. While the invisible duergar is mounted on a female steeder, the steeder is invisible as well. The invisibility ends early on the steeder immediately after it attacks.

## Description
The kavalrachni are duergar cavalry, trained to fight while riding steeders.
