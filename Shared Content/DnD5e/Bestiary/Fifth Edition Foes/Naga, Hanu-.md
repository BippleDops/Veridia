## Special Traits
**Dominate Apes:** A hanu-naga can dance in a writhing, hypnotic way that charms apes, baboons, [[Mandrill|mandrills]], and other primates with Intelligence scores of 5 or less (including humanoids). It can perform this dance even while fighting. When it dances, all primates within 60 feet are charmed by the hanu-naga, and all other primates within one mile are drawn to the hanu-naga's location at top speed. It can have up to 20 creatures charmed this way at one time. The hanu-naga has telepathic communication with the creatures it's charmed, and they do their utmost to carry out its simple commands as if they are affected by a dominate beast spell. Its control lasts for as long as the hanu-naga continues dancing. Humanoids of Intelligence 5 or less who are within 60 feet of a dancing hanu-naga must make a successful DC 12 Charisma saving throw to avoid the hanu-naga's charm. One successful save renders a humanoid immune to this charm effect for 24 hours.

A creature has tactical disadvantage on this saving throw if it is grappled by the hanu-naga.

## Description
Hanu-nagas are a form of naga with the head and face of an ape instead of a human or other creature. They are less magical than the humanheaded variety but more savage.

These nagas lair in jungles and rainforests, where they haunt overgrown temples and ancient ruins. In these remote regions, many hanu-nagas are worshipped by tribes of wild primates. The most intelligent hanu-nagas sometimes even have followings of more advanced humanoids such as cavemen and primitive tribesmen.

The stylized, writhing dance of a hanu-naga allows it to exert a mystic control over nearby primates, including simple-minded humanoids. This might explain their influence over tribes of primitive humans.

Although they’re no geniuses, hanu-nagas are more intelligent than their brutish features suggest they are. They also live for centuries, meaning they sometimes have first-hand knowledge about the history of the ruins they inhabit. They’ve been known to teach themselves to read the inscriptions carved on crumbling temple walls and vine-choked edifices. Such knowledge makes hanu-nagas excellent allies for adventurers looking to explore or plunder ancient jungle sites, if a way can be found to placate the creatures’ bloodlust and their deep mistrust of strangers.
