# Rary's Replay (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *divination*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Self (10-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour


## Effects
You read the residual psychic impressions in a room or area. Typically, you can only read the most recent events, but a highly-emotional event, especially one that is also very unusual or violent, leaves psychic energies that can be picked up for months or years afterwards. The event is played back perfectlyâ€”you see, hear, smell, and feel the events perfectly.

The event that is replayed for you is done so in real-time, so the replay takes as long to complete as the original event, to a maxi-mum of one hour.
