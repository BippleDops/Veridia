--- # Creation

*5th-level, Illusion* - **Casting time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a paintbrush)
- **Duration:** Special You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create an object within range. It is either an object of vegetable matter (soft goods, rope, wood, and the like) or mineral matter (stone, crystal, metal, and the like). The object must be no larger than a 5-foot [[Cube Area of Effect Xphb, and the object must be of a form and material that you have seen. The spell's duration depends on the object's material, as shown in the Materials table. If the object is composed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration. Using any object created by this spell as another spell's Material component causes the other spell to fail. **Materials** | Material | Duration |

|----------|----------|
| Vegetable matter | 24 hours |
| Stone or crystal | 12 hours |
| Precious metals | 1 hour |
| Gems | 10 minutes |
| Adamantine or mithral | 1 minute |

^materials **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The [Cube Area of Effect Xphb]] increases by 5 feet for each spell slot level above 5. **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 259.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of creation xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around creation xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## Spell Components Detail
