# The Sunken Treasure Inn

## General Info
**Location**: [[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/Locations/Shadowhaven]] Docks

## Description
The Sunken Treasure is a cheap and dirty inn that is popular with sailors and other lowlifes. It is a good place to find a cheap room and a stiff drink, but it is also a dangerous place for those who are not careful.

## GM Notes
- The inn is a hotbed of rumors and gossip.
- The city guard keeps a close eye on the inn, but they are reluctant to intervene unless absolutely necessary.
- The Thieves Guild uses the inn as a recruiting ground.
