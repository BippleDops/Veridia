# Crossbow Bolt of Slaying

## Overview
**Type**: Magic Item

**Group**: [[3 - Weapons|Weapons]]* ([[Arrows (20)|arrow]])*

**Rarity**: *very rare*


## Description
A *Crossbow Bolt of Slaying* is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both *crossbow bolt of dragon slaying* and *crossbow bolt of blue dragon slaying*. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with a *crossbow bolt of slaying* takes damage from the blowgun needle, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra `dice: 6d10` (6d10) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once a *crossbow bolt of slaying* deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical Crossbow Bolt.
