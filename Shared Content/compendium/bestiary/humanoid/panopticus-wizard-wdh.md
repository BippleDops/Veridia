## Description

This bald-headed and tattooed dwarf operates Xanathar's "panopticus" magical surveillance system.

Apprentice wizards are novice arcane spellcasters who serve more experienced wizards or attend school. They perform menial work, such as cooking and cleaning, in exchange for education in the ways of magic.
