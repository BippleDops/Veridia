The fortress maintains secret communication with an underwater civilization thought to be extinct, providing mutual intelligence and support. This alliance is known only to the highest levels of command and could be controversial if revealed.

### The Temporal Arsenal
Some of the weapons in the fortress's arsenal are actually from the future, having appeared through temporal anomalies in the ocean currents. These advanced devices give the fortress capabilities that shouldn't exist yet.

### The Failsafe Protocol
Hidden throughout the fortress are systems designed to completely destroy the installation if it were ever to fall into enemy hands. Only Commander Pressureborn knows the full extent of these systems and how to activate them.
