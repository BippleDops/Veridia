# Estate Transference (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *9th-level*

**School**: *conjuration*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 hour

**Range**: Self (up to a 20-square-mile radius sphere)

**Components**: V, S, M (a magical item used to control elementals of the appropriate kind, which must be placed in the center of the area to be affected and remain there permanently, and a large number of bricks made of elemental matter.

**Duration**: Permanent.


## Effects
You mark out a large area of land by sur-rounding it with bricks made out of the solidified material from one of the elemental planes (placed no more than five feet apart and/or three feet underground), and in the center of that area, you place the elemental-controlling item (which must be of the same element as the bricks). Then, when you cast this spell, a sphere containing all the land, water, and air you marked is permanently transferred to that plane, leaving nothing behind but a semicircular hole in the ground. You create a pocket of Prime Material matter within that elemental plane. The water and air are self-renewing, and the temperature and weather conditions of your pocket are identical to the way they were when you cast this spell.

The heart of this spell is in the elemental-controlling item. If this item is disturbed in any way, the spell immediately fails and the energies of the elemental plane flood into the protected area.
