--- # Find Steed

*2nd-level, Conjuration* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous You summon an otherworldly being that appears as a loyal steed in an unoccupied space of your choice within range. This creature uses the [[otherworldly-steed-xphb (miscellaneous)]] stat block. If you already have a steed from this spell, the steed is replaced by the new one. The steed resembles a Large, rideable animal of your choice, such as a horse, a camel, a dire wolf, or an elk. Whenever you cast the spell, choose the steed's creature typeâ€”Celestial, Fey, or Fiendâ€”which determines certain traits in the stat block. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Combat The steed is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, it shares your [[Initiative Xphb]] count, and it functions as a controlled mount while you ride it (as defined in the rules on "mounted combat"). If you have the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] condition, the steed takes its turn immediately after yours and acts independently, focusing on protecting you. ## Disappearance of the Steed The steed disappears if it drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] or if you die. When it disappears, it leaves behind anything it was wearing or carrying. If you cast this spell again, you decide whether you summon the steed that disappeared or a different one. ## Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block. ## Summary **Classes**: [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 272. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* ## Player-Facing Summary Find steed xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of find steed xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around find steed xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Covenant - Control trade routes ## Related Notes - [[Similar Topic 1]]
