## Ecology
**Environment**: Fresh water

**Organization**: Cluster (2–5) or colony (6–11)

## Description
These highly aggressive beetles make their home in deep fresh water such as slow-moving rivers, lakes, large pools, and inland seas. They can be found in any climate, from the warmest to the coldest. Giant water beetles are predators. They sustain themselves on fish and other aquatic animals. They spend most of their lives in the water, rarely emerging onto land. In the rare cases where they are encountered on land, a giant water beetle is seldom more than 30 feet from water. They are diurnal creatures, hunting during the day and sleeping in deep water at night. They dive with blinding speed when they spot a potential meal in the water. When not actively hunting, they sometimes simply drift along with the current.

The giant water beetle normally uses its ink to escape from attackers, but thanks to its tremorsense, it can fight inside the ink cloud without penalty.

Giant water beetles lair on the bottoms of lakes, rivers, and inland seas. A colony always contains at least one female giant water beetle and `dice: 2d4` eggs. Eggs hatch within three weeks after the female deposits them and reach full maturity in six to eight weeks.

When hunting, these creatures prefer to attack by ambushing their prey. They usually drift near the water’s surface and dive down onto targets below them with surprising speed, but they have also been known to drift in darker water at greater depth and lunge upward to seize prey with their tough, sharp mandibles.
