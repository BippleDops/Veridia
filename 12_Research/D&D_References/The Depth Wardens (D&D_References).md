## Organization Overview
The Depth Wardens are Aquabyssos's most specialized and secretive military unit, tasked with protecting the deepest ocean territories where conventional forces cannot operate. Unlike the Pearl Guard who protect the city proper, the Depth Wardens venture into the crushing depths, abyssal trenches, and otherworldly caverns that extend far beneath the known ocean floor.

They serve as both explorers and guardians, investigating deep-sea anomalies, containing eldritch threats, and maintaining the ancient barriers that protect Aquabyssos from the things that dwell in the deepest waters. Their motto: "Where Light Dies, We Stand Watch."

### Specialized Divisions

**The Abyssal Scouts**
- *Role*: Long-range reconnaissance in deepest territories
- *Training*: Extreme depth survival, eldritch resistance, stealth operations
- *Equipment*: Void-touched gear, pressure immunity enchantments, long-range communication crystals

**The Barrier Keepers**
- *Role*: Maintain and repair ancient protective barriers
- *Training*: Runic magic, structural engineering, deep-sea construction
- *Equipment*: Barrier maintece tools, protective ward generators, emergency shelter bubbles

**The Thing Hunters**
- *Role*: Neutralize or contain deep-sea aberrations and eldritch entities
- *Training*: Monster identification, containment protocols, psychological resistance
- *Equipment*: Specialized weapons, containment equipment, sanity-preservation charms

**The Deep Artificers**
- *Role*: Create and maintain pressure-resistant equipment for extreme depths
- *Training*: Enchantment under pressure, void-resistance crafting, emergency repair
- *Equipment*: Portable forges, depth-resistant tools, raw void-touched materials

### Training Regimen
1. **Depth Conditioning** (6 months) - Gradual adaptation to extreme pressures
2. **Void Exposure** (3 months) - Controlled contact with deep-sea aberrations
3. **Barrier Theory** (4 months) - Understanding of protective magical systems
4. **Combat Specialization** (6 months) - Fighting techniques for deep-sea environments
5. **Final Trial** (1 month) - Solo mission to deepest accessible territory

### Primary Responsibilities

**Border Patrol of the Deep**
- Monitor the boundaries between known and unknown waters
- Investigate reports of strange sounds or lights from the abyss
- Prevent deep-sea entities from approaching inhabited areas
- Map and document new deep-sea territories

**Barrier Maintece**
- Service ancient ward-stones that protect Aquabyssos from deep threats
- Repair damage to protective barriers caused by pressure or entities
- Upgrade defensive systems with new magical discoveries
- Monitor barrier integrity through regular deep patrols

**Threat Assessment and Containment**
- Investigate reports of new eldritch entities in deep waters
- Capture or eliminate aberrations that threaten the realm
- Study contained specimens to understand their capabilities
- Develop new containment protocols for unknown threats

**Deep Archaeology**
- Explore ruins and artifacts found in abyssal trenches
- Recover ancient technology that might benefit or threaten Aquabyssos
- Document pre-civilization structures and their purposes
- Determine whether discovered sites should be preserved or destroyed

### Current Operations

**Operation Midnight Tide**
- *Objective*: Investigate reports of "singing" from the Crimson Trench
- *Status*: Three scout teams deployed, one overdue
- *Concern*: The singing appears to be affecting marine life behavior
- *Classification*: Priority Alpha - potential realm-level threat

**The Barrier Audit**
- *Objective*: Comprehensive inspection of all protective barriers
- *Status*: 60% complete, several barriers found weakened
- *Concern*: Damage patterns suggest coordinated attack
- *Classification*: Ongoing - security level elevated

**Deep Salvage Project**
- *Objective*: Recover ancient artifacts from recently discovered ruins
- *Status*: Initial exploration complete, full excavation planned
- *Concern*: Site shows signs of recent disturbance by unknown parties
- *Classification*: Classified - royal approval required

**The Void Watch**
- *Objective*: Monitor dimensional instabilities in deepest trenches
- *Status*: Permanent observation posts established
- *Concern*: Readings suggest increasing dimensional weakness
- *Classification*: Ultimate Priority - direct Crown oversight

## Secrets and Hidden Knowledge

> [!warning] DM Secrets
> - **The True Enemy**: The barriers aren't just keeping things outâ€”they're keeping something specific IN
> - **The Deep Schism**: Half the organization knows about the imprisoned entity, half doesn't
> - **The Recruitment Truth**: Some "volunteers" are actually mind-controlled survivors of deep encounters
> - **The Depth-Admiral's Secret**: Torrential Blackwater is slowly being corrupted by deep exposure
> - **The Barrier Sabotage**: Someone within the organization is deliberately weakening protective barriers
> - **The Ancient Pact**: The Depth Wardens were founded to uphold a bargain with an elder deep entity

### The Deepest Secret
Deep beneath even the Depth Wardens' normal operating areas lies the **Primordial Prison** - a containment system holding an entity so powerful and alien that its mere awakening could end all ocean life. The Depth Wardens were founded specifically to maintain this prison, though many current members don't know this truth.

### How to Join
1. **Military Service**: Transfer from regular Aquabyssos military units
2. **Civilian Application**: Direct application with extensive testing
3. **Emergency Conscription**: Survivors of deep-sea encounters may be recruited
4. **Hereditary Selection**: Children of Depth Wardens receive priority consideration

## Adventure Hooks

1. **The Silent Patrol**: A Depth Warden patrol has gone silent in the Midnight Trench. Investigation reveals they've discovered something that challenges everything known about the deep ocean.

2. **Barrier Breach**: One of the protective barriers has been sabotaged from within. The party must identify the traitor before more barriers fail and something terrible escapes.

3. **The Deep Recruitment**: The party is recruited (voluntarily or otherwise) after witnessing something in deep waters that they shouldn't have seen. They must prove themselves worthy or face "permanent reassignment."

4. **The Ancient Signal**: Depth Warden monitoring stations detect a signal from deeper than any known civilization. The party must investigate whether it's a threat, an opportunity, or something far worse.

5. **The Corrupted Commander**: A respected Trench Commander begins showing signs of deep-influence corruption. The party must determine if they can be saved or must be stopped.

6. **The Specimen Escape**: Something has escaped from the Specimen Vault and is heading toward populated areas. The party must recapture it before it causes massive casualties or reveals state secrets.

7. **The Deep Heresy**: Evidence suggests some Depth Wardens are actively working to weaken the barriers they're supposed to protect. The party must uncover the conspiracy without alerting the traitors.

8. **The Final Depth**: The Depth Wardens discover the ultimate secret they've been guarding and must decide whether to maintain the ancient prison or risk everything by seeking a permanent solution.

## Connected Elements
- **The Heart of Oceanus**: The Depth Wardens serve as the Heart's most devoted guardians
- **The Pearl Guard**: Coordinate defense of Aquabyssos from different vectors
- **The Convergence**: Dimensional instability affects the barriers they maintain
- **Ancient Threats**: Many deep entities are connected to pre-civilization powers
- **Royal Politics**: The Crown depends on them but fears what they might discover

The Depth Wardens represent the theme that some knowledge and some duties are too dangerous for ordinary citizens, and that true guardianship sometimes requires personal sacrifice and terrible secrets. They embody the price of security and the weight of protecting others from truths they cannot handle.

## Player-Facing Summary

The Depth Wardens is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of The Depth Wardens as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around The Depth Wardens.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
