# Harbor District
## The Beating Heart of Aquabyssos Commerce

> *"Every current that flows through our realm passes through these docks first. Control the harbor, control the kingdom."*
> â€” [[Harbormaster Erik Saltbeard]]

## Overview

The Harbor District serves as the primary maritime gateway to [[Port Meridian]] and the lifeblood of [[Aquabyssos]]'s trade economy. Sprawling across the city's eastern waterfront, this bustling district encompasses dozens of docks, warehouses, shipping offices, and the complex infrastructure needed to manage the constant flow of vessels, cargo, and pressure-suited travelers moving between the depths and the surface world. The rhythmic hiss of pressure equalizers, the grinding of massive cargo winches, and the calls of dock workers create a symphony of commerce that never ceases.

> [!secret] DM Secret
> The harbor's pressure regulation system is slowly failing due to sabotage by a deep-sea cult that believes the "artificial" pressure systems are an insult to the natural order. They've been making subtle modifications that will eventually cause a catastrophic failure, flooding the harbor with crushing deep-sea pressure. The signs are there for careful observers, but the cult has infiltrated the pressure maintenance crews to cover their tracks.
