# Ice Storm
A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `dice: 2d8|avg` (2d8) bludgeoning damage and `dice: 4d6|avg` (4d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Hailstones turn the storm's area of effect into {@quickref difficult terrain||3} until the end of your next turn.


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
