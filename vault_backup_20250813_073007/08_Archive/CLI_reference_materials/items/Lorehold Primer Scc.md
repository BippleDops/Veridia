# Lorehold Primer
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  



The Lorehold Primer is a magic textbook created at Strixhaven's Lorehold College. The primer has 3 charges, and it regains `d3` expended charges daily at dawn. If you make an Intelligence ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#History|History]]) or Intelligence ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Religion|Religion]]) check while holding the primer, you can expend 1 charge to give yourself `d4` bonus to the check, immediately after you roll the `d20`.

In addition, if you study the primer at the end of a long rest, you can choose one 1st-level spell from the cleric or wizard spell list. Before you finish your next long rest, you can cast the chosen spell once without a spell slot if you are holding the primer. Your spellcasting ability for this spell is your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.
