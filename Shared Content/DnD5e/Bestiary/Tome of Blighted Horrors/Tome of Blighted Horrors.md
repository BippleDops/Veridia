# <center>The Tome of Blighted Horrors</center>

**Summary:** This book is a Blight GM's best friend; it takes the 24 new monsters and templates to be found in the Bestiary chapter of The Blight GM Guide and breaks them out into a separate book before adding more than 50 additional new Blight and Between monsters to this mix and bringing the total up to over 80 new monters. In addition the book provides new universal monster rules and compiles new subtypes and feats along with with all the subtypes and feats in existing Frog God Games Tomes of Horrors  into a single book for ease of reference.

Don't go into a game with your players unarmed. Take The Tome of Blighted Horrors with you, and let them know the danger of venturing into The Blight.

**Requirements:** For use with The Blight: Richard Pett's Crooked City

Let’s be honest with ourselves for a moment: I think we all kind of already knew that Richard Pett is a little messed up, right? I mean, ***Frog God Games*** agreeing to publish ***The [[Blight]]*** didn’t bring about the book’s inception — it was something Richard had already written … years before … for his players at home! (God rest their sanity-blasted souls.) So when we decided that he had created a sufficient number of new monsters for the book to justify an entire *Tome of Horrors* — a *Tome of* Blighted *Horrors*, if you will — I don’t think anyone was surprised by the disturbing segments of brain-matter-given-life that tumbled out of Richard’s skull. But when we asked a handful of other writers, veteran and novice alike, to contribute to this compilation of congealed madness, the horrors that tumbled from their own mental palettes, well … there’s where the surprise — the kind of surprise that begins as a startle and then slowly transforms into numbing horror — really began.

I have only myself to blame really. When Richard and I were first spit balling this project (originally intended to be a release for Sinister Adventures) years ago, I sat down to write an additional adventure set in Rich’s diabolically twisted playground. I read through Richard’s material, permitted myself a cruel chuckle at its depravity, read as many forbidden, sanity-destroying tomes as I could get my hands on through Amazon (who knew they had Ludwig Prinn’s *De Vermis Mysteriis* in paperback!!), and then sat down at my keyboard deciding to channel my inner Pett. I thought I’d delve a little into the body horror for which Richard has such an affinity and … babies! … nothing’s scarier than larval humans, right? So this little descent into madness brought about the introduction of the insidious [[Spite-Waif|spite-waif]]. “Heh, heh,” I thought, “that’ll scare ’em.” Fast forward to 2016 when I began to get turnovers in from the various other authors hired to contribute to the new ***Tome of Blighted Horrors***.

Some things I learned:

1. Yes, babies are truly scary. Having spawned three of the little monsters myself, I should have already known this, but the proof came in the form of how many of the authors dipped into the same well (without prompting). And how much their creations frightened me. From Richard’s own totally-unnecessary-why-did-he-do-it-for-the-love-of-God-why? [[Caul Cuckoo|caul cuckoo]] and [[Caul Cuckoo|caul cuckoo]] syre, I soon realized I was in trouble. The true shock, however, didn’t come until I laid eyes on the work from freshman designer Jeff Swank, when he sent in his totally original monster design of the [[Ghoul, Gravid|gravid ghoul]]. Jeff is a doctor, I must add. I think, perhaps, I should reflect a bit on my own career choice after this …

2. Artists aren’t always quite as on board with the insanity. Terry Pavlet (bless his heart) took on the task of illustrating about 99% of this beast. I don’t know Terry well, but I don’t think his background is specifically in dark fantasy art because of how many times he asked me for an example of what I was trying to describe in my art orders. No, Terry, there is no example I can give you for which we can thank God, natural selection, and a merciful universe. There are no examples because these things weren’t meant to exist in a universe governed by scientific laws. I can’t blame him though. Trying to illustrate the interior of Richard’s brain is like trying to illustrate a Lovecraft story. It’s tough to come up with a concept sketch off the description, “the terrible thing is indescribable.” I did my best. I can’t tell you how many email replies I received from Terry that started with, “Hahahahahahahaha!” Kudos to you, Terry. You’re a real trooper. We are deeply indebted to your patience and creative skills. In reward for this, you shall be the last to be eaten.

3. I believe Friedrich Nietzsche said, “\[I]f you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into you.” Yeah, that sounds about right.

Now if you’ll excuse me, I can hear them thumping around in the basement again. Mustn’t let anyone get free before the big ceremony.

*Iä! Iä! The Beautiful fhtagn!*

## Foreword
```ad-warning
title: GM Directions
collapse: open
The first time I met Richard Pett, an exuberant Nicolas Logue—no doubt channeling a scene from the Grast Farm in his infamous *Hook Mountain Massacre*—was holding him down on a leather couch while attempting to wear him like a glove puppet. I was pretty drunk, granted, but I’m fairly certain that Nick failed in his anatomic insertion attempt, and thus Rich’s identity as the true author of *The Skinsaw Murders* was defended…much to Nick’s chagrin.

The second time I met Richard Pett, I was far less drunk and Nick was nowhere in sight, so we talked about adventure and setting design. Rich, as you’re surely aware, is a master of both. His work for Paizo may be among his best known, having written—to date, because there are no signs of him stopping—twelve parts of Pathfinder adventure paths—from the aforementioned chapter of *Rise of the Runelords* to *The Whisper Out of Time* in the imminent *Strange Aeons*—and five Pathfinder modules, including *Carrion Hill* and the popular *We Be Goblins* series.

However, I’d been a fan since his earliest publications in *Dungeon Magazine* where he, along with Nick, first established his design credentials and rose to prominence. And so we talked a little about *The Devil Box* and of his contributions to the ‘proto-paths,’ including *The Prince of Redhand* and the Midnight’s Muddle and Alhaster backdrops for *Age of Worms*, along with *The Sea-Wyvern’s Wake* and *Serpents of Scuttlecove* for *Savage Tide*. But we spent the most time discussing what are perhaps now regarded as his seminal works: *The Styes* and *The Weavers*. These were the inventive, gritty, stylish scenarios that first distinguished him and I wanted to know all about their evocative setting and any other adventures within it that I may have missed.

That’s when I learned of his long-running home campaign and its vast body of unpublished works based in those shadowed and sleazy docklands. And not only that, but that he was organizing and updating it all in preparation for future publication through Frog God Games. I immediately offered my help and, a few weeks later, the manuscript of *The Crucible* arrived in my inbox, ready for conversion, development, and editing, and my descent into what would become *The [[Blight]]* began. That was over three years ago.

What you now hold in your hands—this nexus of nightmare—is a distillation of the spiritual abuse that Mr Pett has inflicted upon Greg, Jeff, John, Dave, Pete, or I at some point over that time. For while Rich himself has personally detailed only a handful of the monstrosities herein, you’ll notice that almost all are inspired by something he’d already described in *The [[Blight]]*. Crones whose emetic, morbidly obese bodies can barely withstand the intake of each of their five heads’ prodigious appetites for flesh. Insane reincarnations of the devolved bodies of plague victims that morph through aberrant physicalities to further spread death and disease. Emaciated fey who float up from the depths of the Lyme to flood the lungs of their hypnotized victims through a kiss. Small slimy humanoids who compress their cartilaginous skeletons to live in the wall and floor spaces of other peoples’ homes and watch their intimacies.

“Based on material by Richard Pett.”

It’s not a credit, it’s a mental health warning. For herein, you’ll also find fiendish entities of flame that grow in size and power as they incinerate people; ‘machines’ of reanimated muscle and tissue which sometimes manifest an emergent consciousness that reflects the thoughts, fears, and desires of those who operate them; incarnations of arachnophobia whose young eat their way out of their victims’ stomachs; and the freakish hybrids that result from the amoral application of obscene fertility magic.

So that’s nice. As he proved to Nick, Rich is no other designer’s meat puppet. But the truth is, some of us may now be his.
