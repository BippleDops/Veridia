# Armor Class
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 361. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* 

An Armor Class (AC) is the target number for an attack roll. AC represents how difficult it is to hit a target.

Your base AC calculation is 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If a rule gives you another base AC calculation, you choose which calculation to use; you can't use more than one.
