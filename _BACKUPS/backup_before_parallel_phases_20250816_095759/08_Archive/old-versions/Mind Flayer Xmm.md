*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 214* A mind flayer's hunger for brains is outmeasured only by its thirst for domice, and it embraces any plot that allows it to indulge both. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Mind Flayers *Brain-Eating Underdark Tyrants* - **Habitat.** Underdark - **Treasure.** Arcana Scattered survivors of a world-ruining, multiversal empire, mind flayers lurk in secret conclaves hidden deep within Material Plane worlds. Within their alien sanctuaries, these wicked mastermindsâ€”also known as illithidsâ€”reshape the Underdark and its inhabitants to serve their unfathomable whims. Mind flayers are feared for their psionic powers, which allow them to stun and control other creatures, and for their horrific method of feeding: using their four slimy tentacles to extract the brains of their victims. Mind flayers are infamous plotters and manipulators, concocting plans that reach beyond their subterranean realms. Aside from using their psionic powers to control others, mind flayers often experiment with their own bizarre life cycles, implanting other creatures with illithid young to create unnatural servants. Creatures such as grimlocks and intellect devourers result from mind flayers' biological tampering, while other Underdark-dwelling monstersâ€”including kuo-toa, quaggoths, and troglodytesâ€”often serve illithid masters. Githyanki and githzerai have a long adversarial history with mind flayers and bear the scars of illithid manipulation. ### Mind Flayer Colonies Mind flayers work as lone schemers, in mysterious cabals, or as part of worlds-spanning illithid conspiracies. In groups, mind flayers work toward bizarre agendas organized by an elder brainâ€”a massive, brain-like being with incredible psionic powers. Without such a leader, groups of mind flayers fall to self-destructive squabbling. Roll on or choose a result from the Mind Flayer Machinations table to inspire an illithid conclave's plots. **Mind Flayer Machinations**`dice: [](mind-flayer-xmm.md#^mind-flayer-machinations)`| dice: `dice: 1d6` | The Mind Flayer Colony Seeks To... |

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of mind flayer xmm as a nexus where past and present converge.
