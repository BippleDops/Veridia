# Wakened Dragon Vessel

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** very rare

**Attunement**: *requires attunement*

## Description

This vessel can be a potion bottle, drinking horn, or other container meant to hold a liquid.

As a bonus action, if the vessel is empty, you can speak the command word to fill the vessel with one of the following (your choice): ale, olive oil, mead, wine, a [[potion of healing]], a [[2 - Mechanical Reference/Items/Magic Items for Dungeons & Dragons 5e SRD/N-Z/Potion of Healing|Potion of Greater Healing]], a [[potion of superior healing]], a [[potion of climbing]], a [[potion of fire breath]], or a [[potion of flying]]. Once this property is used, it can't be used until the next dawn. A potion you create in this way loses its magical properties if it isn't imbibed within 24 hours.
