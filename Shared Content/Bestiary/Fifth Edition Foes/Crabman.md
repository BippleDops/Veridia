## Description
Crabmen inhabit coastal water, where they hunt for fish and other food. Their language is unique, relying on buzzes and clicks that can be produced underwater without the distortion that makes breath-based language unintelligible. Those with Intelligence 12 or higher sometimes learn Common from land-dwelling traders and sailors.

Crabmen make their homes in sea caves and coastal cliffs. They spend most of their time hunting, filtering algae for food, or scavenging along rocky shores and beaches for flotsam from shipwrecks. They can subsist by gathering wet sand from the seashore and filtering it through their mouths, sucking out all organic material, but they prefer not to. The hardened, dry balls of sand left behind can be a clue that there is a crabman community nearby.

Some communities excavate expansive burrows into sea-facing cliffs. Within such a warren, each individual has a lair set off from a centralized meeting area. Each crabman tribe is led by an elder that can be of either sex. Most crabman tribal elders are at least 3rdlevel warriors.

Crabmen have no regular breeding or mating cycle. Each female seems to have her own phases of fertility and infertility. A fertile female produces about 100 eggs over a span of two weeks. Crabman eggs are released into the ocean, where they hatch into translucent larvae with soft shells. These larvae vaguely resemble the adults but can be mistaken for normal crabs. After six months, these larvae molt, develop more humanoid body structure, and develop the harder shell required for life on land. Before their first molting, crabman larvae are largely defenseless; they hide in coral reefs and among kelp beds for safety. They receive no protection or parenting of any kind until after they emerge onto land.

Crabmen rarely engage in commerce with other humanoid communities around them, including other crabman tribes. Crabman artisans produce only ephemeral goods made of driftwood, shells, and seaweed, but they are quite capable of producing what more aesthetic races would call works of art.
