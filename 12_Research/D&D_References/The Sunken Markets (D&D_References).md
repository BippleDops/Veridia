Beneath [[Port Meridian|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]]'s harbor lies an otherworldly marketplace that exists half-submerged, where air-breathing merchants trade with denizens of the deep. Discovered only two years ago when the Crimson Shard's placement in the harbor caused tidal anomalies, the Sunken Markets have become a crucial but dangerous connection point between Aethermoor and [[Aquabyssos]]. ## Structure

The Markets occupy a series of partially flooded caves and ruins that predate the current city: ## Laws & Customs

1. No violence in the Exchange Pools (enforced by ancient magic)
2. All trades must be witnessed by a Depth Speaker
3. Blood debts carry over between surface and deep
4. Certain names must not be spoken (invoke deep curses)
5. Iron weapons forbidden (rust corrupts the waters) ## Secrets

The location's mix of commerce and danger provides opportunities for social encounters, investigation, and combat. The various factions present create natural conflict and alliance opportunities. The ancient nature of the site connects to the deeper mysteries of both the Seven Shards and the origins of the crystal corruption. ## Player-Facing Summary The Sunken Markets is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Sunken Markets as a nexus where past and present converge.
