## Overview
Father Aquilus Deepprayer is the sole remaining priest of the Old Faith, a religious tradition that once dominated Aquabyssos before political changes led to its suppression. He maintains a hidden shrine in the deepest parts of the city, serving any who still remember the old ways.

Once part of a thriving religious hierarchy, he now stands alone as keeper of ancient rites, forbidden knowledge, and the spiritual needs of those who reject the new state-approved religion.

## Background
Father Aquilus served in the Great Temple when the Old Faith was still legal. Political pressure from the crown led to religious persecution, forcing most priests to convert, flee, or face imprisonment. He chose to remain, going underground to serve the faithful.

For fifteen years, he has maintained his calling in secret, performing marriages, funerals, and other rites for those who still believe.

## Hidden Shrine
**Location**: Abandoned storage chambers three levels below Harbor District
**Features**: Simple altar, religious artwork, library of forbidden texts
**Security**: Multiple hidden entrances, magical wards against detection
**Congregation**: 12-20 regular worshipers attend secret services
**Supplies**: Basic necessities provided by faithful supporters

## The Old Faith
**Core Beliefs**: Ancient water spirits, ancestor worship, natural harmony
**Practices**: Tidal ceremonies, depth meditation, sacred swimming
**Holidays**: Seasonal celebrations tied to ocean currents
**Scriptures**: Ancient texts written in pre-monarchical language
**Opposition**: Conflicts with state-approved religion's dogma

## Relationships
**Underground Faithful**: Network of secret believers throughout city
**Government Agents**: Actively hunted by religious enforcement officers
**New Faith Priests**: Former colleagues who converted under pressure
**Common Citizens**: Many still secretly respect the old ways
**Criminal Underground**: Occasionally provides sanctuary for his activities

## Adventure Hooks
1. Characters need ancient religious knowledge only he possesses
2. Government raid threatens his hidden shrine
3. He requests help recovering stolen religious artifacts
4. Dying believer needs last rites performed in secret

## Potential Character Development
**Ally**: Valuable source of forbidden knowledge and spiritual guidance
**Quest Giver**: Can provide missions involving religious artifacts or persecution
**Tragic Figure**: Represents loss of cultural heritage and religious freedom
**Mentor**: Can teach characters about faith, sacrifice, and standing for principles

## Death and Legacy
If Father Aquilus dies, his death could galvanize the underground faith community or lead to its final dissolution. His hidden shrine and library represent irreplaceable cultural and religious heritage.

## DM Notes
The Last Priest embodies themes of faith versus authority, cultural preservation, and personal sacrifice. Use him to explore religious freedom, the cost of standing up for beliefs, and the value of tradition in changing times.
