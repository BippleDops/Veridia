# Gunpowder (powder horn)
*Explosive*  

- **Cost**: 35 gp
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

Setting fire to a powder horn full of Gunpowder causes it to explode. When a powder horn explodes, each creature in a 10-foot-radius [[Area of Effect Xphb]] centered on the powder horn makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
