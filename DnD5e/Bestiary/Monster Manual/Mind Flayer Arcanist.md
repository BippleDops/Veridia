At will: *detect thoughts, levitate*
1/day each: *dominate monster, plane shift (self only)*

***Magic Resistance.*** The mind flayer has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** The mind flayer is a 10th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). The mind flayer has the following wizard spells prepared:
Cantrips (at will): *blade ward, dancing lights, mage hand, shocking grasp*
1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, disguise self, shield, sleep*
2nd level (3 slots): *blur, invisibility, ray of enfeeblement*
3rd level (3 slots): *clairvoyance, lightning bolt, sending*
4th level (3 slots): *confusion, hallucinatory terrain*
5th level (2 slots): *telekinesis, wall of force*

## Actions
***Tentacles.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (`dice: 2d10+4`) psychic damage. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 15) and must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until this grapple ends.

***Extract Brain.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one incapacitated humanoid grappled by the mind flayer. Hit: The target takes 55 (`dice: 10d10`) piercing damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, the mind flayer kills the target by extracting and devouring its brain.

***Mind Blast (Recharge 5-6).*** The mind flayer magically emits psychic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 22 (`dice: 4d8+4`) psychic damage and be stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Description
A few mind flayers supplement their psionic power with arcane spells. However, they are regarded as deviants by their illithid peers and usually shunned.
