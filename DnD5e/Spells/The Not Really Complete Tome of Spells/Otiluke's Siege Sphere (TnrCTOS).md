# Otiluke's Siege Sphere (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of diamond dust)

**Duration**: 10 minutes


## Effects
You create a large, bolder-sized unbreak-able sphere of force that can be fired from a catapult or trebuchet (and thus uses that siege equipment’s range). You designate what form you wish the sphere to take:

♦ ***Crystal Shards.*** The sphere splinters apart while 30 feet above the target. All creatures in a 20-foot radius beneath it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 10d6 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

♦ ***Liquid Fire.*** The sphere shatters on impact, spraying sticky fire in a 30-foot radius. All creatures in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one; all creatures also take 2d6 fire damage each round for 2d8 rounds. The sticky fire also sets all combustibles on fire.

♦ ***Wrecking Ball.*** The sphere becomes as hard as adamantine and twice as heavy. It does 8d8 bludgeoning damage. Objects and buildings take twice as much damage.
