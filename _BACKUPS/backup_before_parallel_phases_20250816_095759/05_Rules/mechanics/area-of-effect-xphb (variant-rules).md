--- # Area of Effect

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 361. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* The descriptions of many spells and other features specify that they have an area of effect, which typically has one of six shapes. These shapes are defined elsewhere in this glossary: - [[Area of Effect Xphb - [Cube Area of Effect Xphb]] - [[Area of Effect Xphb - [Area of Effect Xphb]] - [[Area of Effect Xphb - [Area of Effect Xphb]] An area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the effect's energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how to position its point of origin. If all straight lines extending from the point of origin to a location in the area of effect are blocked, that location isn't included in the area of effect. To block a line, an obstruction must provide [[Cover Xphb]]. If the creator of an area of effect places it at an unseen point and an obstruction—such as a wall—is between the creator and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of the obstruction. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Area of effect xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
