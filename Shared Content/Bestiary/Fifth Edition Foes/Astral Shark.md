## Special Traits
**Astral Scent:** An astral shark is highly attuned to the energy of a traveler in the Astral Plane. It automatically detects all living creatures within 180 ft. of itself.

**Sever Silver Cord:** When an astral shark scores a critical hit with its bite, in addition to the normal effects of a critical hit, the target creature must attempt a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Failure indicates that the astral shark severed the silver cord connecting the target's astral form to its material body, and the target creature dies instantly.

## Description
An astral shark is a sleek creature that resembles a shark but spends its entire life in the Astral Plane; astral sharks can’t materialize on any other plane. Among the lower life forms of the Astral Plane, the astral shark is near the top of the food chain. When astral sharks detect extraplanar visitors nearby, the astral sharks attack them in preference to any other prey and seldom stop attacking until they’re killed. It is unknown if the astral shark is drawn to the visitors’ strange energy or if it somehow gains special nutrition from them or from the silver cord that connects an astral traveler to its material body.

Most astral sharks are 10 to 15 feet long, but they can grow to lengths of nearly 30 feet. An astral shark’s tactics resemble those of its Material Plane counterpart: circling its prey, then darting in and biting with its powerful jaws. Astral sharks are greatly feared by experienced astral travelers.
