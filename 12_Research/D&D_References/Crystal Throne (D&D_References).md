Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Crystal Throne as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Crystal Throne. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Plot Hooks - A stranger needs help delivering before the festival

- A journal reveals a conspiracy about the cult
- Someone is blackmailing information for revenge ## Related Notes - [[Similar Topic 1]]
