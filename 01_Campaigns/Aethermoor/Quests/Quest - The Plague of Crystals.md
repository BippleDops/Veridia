# Quest - The Plague of Crystals
*A Corruption Spreading Like Wildfire*

## Overview
A mysterious plague is spreading through [[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/Locations/Port Meridian]], causing accelerated crystal corruption that turns victims into crystalline zombies. [[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/NPCs/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]] has secretly commissioned investigators to find the source and stop it before it spreads to other cities—or before people realize how similar it is to her own condition.

## Quest Details

### The Situation
- Started three weeks ago in the dock district
- Victims show Stage 3 corruption in days instead of years
- Corrupted become violent and attack others
- Traditional healing methods fail
- Quarantine zone established but failing

### The Real Problem
> [!warning] DM Only
> A corrupted Shard of the Crown was smuggled into the harbor by [[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/Factions/The Whisper Syndicate]]. It's hidden in a sunken ship, radiating corruption through the water. [[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/NPCs/Vex Shadowthorn]] knows but is using the chaos for profit while searching for the Shard.
