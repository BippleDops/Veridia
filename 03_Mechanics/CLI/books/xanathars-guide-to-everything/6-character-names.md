# Character Names
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything, p. 173* 

Some players and DMs have a knack for coming up with  character names on the fly, while others find that task  more of a challenge. The tables in this appendix are  designed to make life easier for both kinds of people,  whether you're naming a player character, a nonplayer  character, a monster, or even a place.

Each table contains names that are associated with  a nonhuman character race in the player's handbook or a real-world ethnic or language group, with a focus  on groups from antiquity and the Middle Ages. You can select from the possibilities here, or use dice to determine a name.

Even though names are associated with races in this  appendix, a character might not have a name from their  own race. For instance, a half-orc might have grown up  among dwarves and have a dwarven name. Or, as DM,  you might decide that dragonborn in your campaign  have a culture reminiscent of ancient Rome and therefore use Roman names, rather than the dragonborn names suggested here.

See the names page for the full collection of name tables.

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
