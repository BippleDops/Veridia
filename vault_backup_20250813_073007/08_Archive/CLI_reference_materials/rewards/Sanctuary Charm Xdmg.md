# Sanctuary Charm
*Charm*  

After spending a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]] in your "Bastion", you gain a magical Charm (see ""Supernatural Gifts"" in "chapter 3") that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/healing-word-xphb|Healing Word]] once without expending a spell slot. You can't gain this Charm again while you still have it.
