# Personal Supplies
## Overview
Why maintain a refined and elegant home while allowing yourself to look like a grubby barbarian? Surely one’s health and appearance rank equal in importance to the sharpness of one’s sword and the fertility of one’s fields. As the elfish witticism runs, “A sharp appearance is more deadly than a sharp sword.” Recognizing this fact, I am pleased to offer Toril’s finest assortment of personal supplies for the maintenance of health and beauty.
