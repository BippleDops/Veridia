# The Shadow Conspiracy
*The Dark Harvest Architects, The Replacement Initiative, Those Who Cast No Light*

## Overview
The Shadow Conspiracy is a coordinated effort by independent shadows to systematically replace the population of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] with shadow duplicates. Born from the phenomenon of shadows gaining independence 50 years ago, the conspiracy has infiltrated every level of society, from the [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Parliament of Echoes]] to common merchants.
