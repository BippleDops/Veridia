Up to four Medium creatures can be inside the gulper at one time; two Small or smaller creatures count as one Medium creature. A swallowed creature is unaffected by anything happening outside the gulper or by attacks from outside it. A swallowed creature can get out of the gulper by using 5 feet of movement, but only after the gulper is dead.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any aquatic

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
This larger version of the common eel makes its home in deep water: well below 3,000 feet of depth, and they seldom come above that level. At such depth, it cares little whether the weather above is tropical or arctic. The gulper spends its life dining on giant shrimp and any other creatures which happen to arouse its senses.

Solitary creatures by nature, during mating season (typically winter months), it is common to find a pair of these creatures together. The female deposits 2–8 eggs in the sea bottom, and they hatch within two months. Young gulper eels are dependent on their parents for survival for only about two weeks. After that, the family splits up again, everyone going their separate ways.

A gulper eel averages 10 feet in length but some as long as 30 feet have been reported, if such wild tales are to be believed. Its body is long, sleek, and black in color, and its tail ends in a luminous organ. The gulper’s eyes are small for its body and very close to its snout. It massive mouth is lined with rows of needlelike teeth. Because a gulper eel can unhinge its jaw and stretch its stomach, it can swallow tremendous quantities of food and opponents as large as itself.
