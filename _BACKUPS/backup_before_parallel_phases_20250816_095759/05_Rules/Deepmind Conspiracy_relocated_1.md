## Overview

[The Deepmind]] Conspiracy represents the most sophisticated intelligence operation in either [[Aethermoor or Aquabyssos - a psychic network that exists primarily in the collective consciousness of its members rather than in physical space. This mental infrastructure allows for instantaneous communication, shared knowledge, and coordinated operations across vast distances without leaving any physical [Evidence]].

Built around a core of powerful psychic individuals, the Conspiracy maintains a hidden web of informants, analysts, and operatives whose minds are [[Linked through complex mental bonds. They gather intelligence not through conventional means, but by reading thoughts, accessing memories, and manipulating the mental states of targets. The [Organization]] serves as the primary intelligence resource for multiple shadow organizations while maintaining its own mysterious agenda.
