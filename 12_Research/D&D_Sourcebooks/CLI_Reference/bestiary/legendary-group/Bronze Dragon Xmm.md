_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_ The region containing an adult or ancient bronze dragon's lair is changed by its presence, creating the following effects: - **Buoying Currents.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair that lack a [[swim-speed-xphb (variant-rules)]] ignore the extra cost of movement while swimming. - **Sun and Storms.** While in its lair, the dragon can cast [[weather]], requiring no Material components and using the same spellcasting ability as its Spellcasting action. When casting the spell this way, the dragon can control the weather within 1 mile of its lair, regardless if the dragon is inside or outside. If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. ## Player-Facing Summary Bronze dragon xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of bronze dragon xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around bronze dragon xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is blackmailing information for love
