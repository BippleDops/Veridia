***Scimitar.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d6+3`) slashing damage.

***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d4+3`) piercing damage.

## Reactions
***Parry.*** The captain adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the captain must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

## Description
It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a gang of [[Bandit|bandits]] in line. The [[Bandit|bandit]] captain has these qualities in spades.

In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the pirate captain is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.

More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain's colorful reputation.
