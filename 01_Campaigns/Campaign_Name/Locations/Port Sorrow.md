# Port Sorrow

## General Info
**Location**: East of [[01_Campaigns/Campaign_Name/Locations/Shadowhaven.md]]

## Description
Port Sorrow is a dark and dangerous city that is a haven for pirates, smugglers, and other criminals. It is a place of violence and despair, and it is not a place for the faint of heart.

## GM Notes
- The city is ruled by the ruthless and charismatic [[01_Campaigns/Campaign_Name/NPCs/Pirate King Razor Blackheart.md]].
- The city is a good place to find illegal goods and services, but it is also a very dangerous place.
- The city is a major rival of [[01_Campaigns/Campaign_Name/Locations/Shadowhaven.md]].
