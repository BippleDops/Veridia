## Overview

The Depth Wardens are the primary law enforcement and security [Organization]] of [[Aquabyssos, serving as both police force and military organization responsible for maintaining order throughout the vast underwater realm. Founded over eight centuries ago during the consolidation of Aquabyssos under [Thalassius the Wise]], the Depth Wardens have evolved from a simple guard force into a sophisticated organization capable of handling everything from routine criminal investigations to existential threats to the realm.

What distinguishes the Depth Wardens from conventional law enforcement is their unique adaptation to the three-dimensional nature of underwater society and the extreme environmental challenges of operating across massive depth ranges. Every Depth Warden undergoes intensive training in pressure adaptation, [[Underwater_Combat|Underwater Combat, deep-sea survival, and the specialized skills required to maintain order in a society that exists in multiple depth zones with radically different environmental conditions.

Their broad authority and diverse responsibilities make them one of the most visible and influential institutions in Aquabyssos society.

The Depth Wardens maintain their headquarters in [Abyssos Prime]], with major regional commands throughout the realm and smaller stations in settlements across all depth zones. They coordinate closely with [[Royal Palace|The [Royal Palace]] on security policy and maintain significant operations at [[Port Meridian Harbor to oversee mari[Time]] security.
