# Quick Start Guide
*Welcome to the dual worlds of Aquabyssos and Aethermoor*

## What You Need to Know

### The Setting in 30 Seconds
- **Two Worlds**: Aquabyssos (underwater empire) and Aethermoor (surface world) were separated 300 years ago
- **The Conflict**: Multiple factions debate whether to reunite, remain separated, or transform into something new
- **Your Role**: Navigate political intrigue, environmental challenges, and cosmic mysteries while deciding the fate of both worlds
- **The Stakes**: Ancient powers stir, reality itself bends, and every choice could tip the balance

## Character Essentials

### Starting Depth Adaptation
All characters begin with **Level 1 Pressure Adaptation**:
- Can survive to 500 feet depth
- Basic pressure equipment provided
- Minor biological modifications (gills, pressure-resistant organs)
- Choose your origin: Surface Dweller, Aquabyssos Native, or Hybrid

### Core Mechanics

#### Depth Zones
| Zone | Depth | Key Challenge |

## Session Zero Checklist

### Prepare for Play
- [ ] Choose starting adaptation level

- [ ] Determine character's stance on world merger
- [ ] Create one NPC connection
- [ ] Review depth zone you'll start in

## Quick Rules Reminders

### Advantage/Disadvantage Sources
**Advantage**:
- Attacking from above in water
- Using adapted senses in your native depth
- Faction support in their territory

**Disadvantage**:
- Fighting outside adaptation zone
- Using non-aquatic weapons underwater
- Acting against faction standing

### Death & Recovery
- **0 HP**: Unconscious, sinking at 10ft/round
- **Death Saves**: Normal, but drowning adds auto-fail
- **Stabilized**: Still need breathing assistance
- **Recovery**: Long rest requires safe depth zone

## New Player Tips

### Do's
- Ask about your environment before acting
- Track your depth and pressure adaptation
- Build relationships with multiple factions
- Prepare for different depth zones
- Embrace the alien nature of the deep

### Don'ts
- Assume surface logic applies underwater
- Ignore pressure warnings
- Trust any single faction completely
- Venture beyond adaptation unprepared
- Forget 3D positioning in combat

## Getting Help

### During Play
- **"What do I see?"** - Always valid, environment is alien
- **"How deep are we?"** - Critical for survival
- **"What's my pressure status?"** - Check before actions
- **"Who can I trust?"** - No simple answers here

*Remember: In the depths, pressure isn't just physicalâ€”it's political, social, and existential. Every choice matters, every alliance has a cost, and the deep remembers everything.*
