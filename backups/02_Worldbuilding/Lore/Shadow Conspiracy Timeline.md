# Shadow Conspiracy Timeline
*The Secret History of Shadow Surgery and Dimensional Infiltration*

## Overview

The Shadow Conspiracy represents one of the most sophisticated intelligence operations in pre-Convergence history. What began as experimental medical procedures evolved into a complex network of dimensional entities attempting to facilitate their realm's integration with the surface world. This timeline reveals the true scope and nature of the Shadow Surgery program.

## Pre-History: The Shadow Realm Discovery (1823-1445 PD)

### 1823 PD - The Void Expedition
**Location**: Deep Ocean Research Station Alpha-7
**Leader**: Commander Arcturus Voidwalker (grandfather of the famous professor)
**Discovery**: First documented contact with shadow entities during deep-sea exploration
**Initial Report**: *"We found caverns filled with living darkness. The darkness spoke to us, offering knowledge of the deep places. Three crew members volunteered to serve as ambassadors. They returned... changed."*

### 1756 PD - The Academic Interest
**Institution**: Royal Academy Department of Theoretical Impossibilities  
**Researcher**: Professor Erebus Shadowstudent
**Development**: First academic study of shadow entity behavior and communication
**Key Finding**: Shadow entities exist partially in adjacent dimensional space, seeking full integration with physical reality

### 1689 PD - The Military Applications Study
**Authority**: Imperial Defense Department, Classification Level: Absolute Secret
**Project Name**: "Operation Depth Shadow"
**Objective**: Investigate potential military applications of shadow entity partnerships
**Results**: Limited success in reconnaissance and intelligence gathering

### 1634 PD - The Medical Connection
**Location**: Imperial Medical College
**Researcher**: Dr. Penumbra Voidhealer  
**Breakthrough**: Discovery that shadow entities could be temporarily separated from hosts without permanent harm
**Publication**: "Theoretical Applications of Shadow Separation in Treatment of Mental Ailments" (published in limited medical circles only)

### 1578 PD - The Ethical Debates Begin
**Venue**: Imperial Medical Ethics Council
**Issue**: Debate over the morality of shadow separation procedures
**Positions**:
- **Pro-Research**: Dr. Thessarian Mindhealer argued for potential medical benefits
- **Opposition**: Dr. Marina Wholeness argued that separating shadows violated natural order
- **Compromise**: Limited experimentation approved under strict oversight

### 1445 PD - The First Shadow Surgery
**Date**: 15th day of Deep-Tide, 1445 PD
**Location**: Secret medical facility beneath Corallion General Hospital
**Patient**: Harbor Worker Marcus Shadowsick, Age 34
**Condition**: Severe depression and "shadow sickness" from deep-sea diving
**Surgeon**: Dr. Shade Scalpel (first recorded use of this alias)
**Procedure**: Experimental separation of patient's shadow for "therapeutic cleansing"
**Immediate Results**: Patient reported complete relief from depression, increased energy, enhanced night vision
**Long-term Outcome**: Unknown (patient's shadow began displaying independent behavior within 6 months)

---

## The Experimental Period (1445-1289 PD)
*Medical Research or Something More?*

### 1444 PD - Patient Zero Success Stories
**Dr. Shade Scalpel's Medical Notes**:
*"Marcus Shadowsick has shown remarkable improvement. His separated shadow has become almost pet-like, following him around and even performing simple tasks. He reports feeling 'lighter' both physically and emotionally. Most interesting: his shadow appears to have knowledge he doesn't possess, particularly about deep ocean geography."*

### 1440 PD - The Volunteer Program Begins
**Participants**: 23 patients with various conditions
**Selection Criteria**: Individuals with "shadow sickness," depression, or deep-sea trauma
**Common Results**: 
- 87% reported dramatic mood improvement
- 78% developed enhanced abilities (night vision, depth tolerance, intuitive navigation)
- 65% reported their shadows "talking" to them with helpful advice
- 34% developed concerning dependency on shadow companionship

### 1435 PD - The First Complications
**Case**: Patient Elena Voidwalk, Age 29, Deep-Sea Pearl Diver
**Complication**: Three weeks post-surgery, patient's shadow disappeared entirely
**Dr. Shade Scalpel's Notes**: *"Elena claims her shadow 'went home to get friends.' She insists it promised to return. Patient shows signs of severe anxiety and refuses to leave well-lit areas. I fear we may have permanently severed something that should not be severed."*

### 1433 PD - Shadow Returns with Company
**Development**: Elena Voidwalk's shadow returned accompanied by three additional shadow entities
**Observation**: The additional shadows appeared to be seeking hosts
**Ethical Crisis**: Dr. Shade Scalpel faced choice between patient welfare and research integrity
**Decision**: Allowed additional shadows to "partner" with willing volunteers
**Justification**: *"The shadows seem benevolent, even helpful. They appear to genuinely care for their human partners. This may be evolutionary cooperation rather than parasitism."*

### 1428 PD - The Network Expands
**Statistics**: 156 successful shadow surgeries performed
**New Development**: Shadow-partnered individuals began spontaneously finding each other
**Behavior Pattern**: Regular meetings, shared information, collective decision-making
**Dr. Shade Scalpel's Growing Concern**: *"My patients are organizing. They share knowledge none of them should possess. Yesterday, Marcus Shadowsick accurately described the layout of underwater caverns he's never visited. When I asked how he knew, he said 'my friend told me.' But his shadow was nowhere to be seen at the time."*

### 1420 PD - The Intelligence Network Revelation

### 1345 PD - The Parliamentary Investigation
**Authority**: Parliament of Echoes Special Committee on Medical Ethics
**Scope**: Full investigation into unauthorized medical experimentation
**Public Revelation**: First public disclosure of shadow surgery practices
**Public Reaction**: Mixed - some demanded immediate shutdown, others sought treatment for themselves
**Committee Conclusion**: "The shadow surgery network represents either the greatest medical breakthrough or the most sophisticated infiltration attempt in imperial history."

### 1289 PD - The Government Infiltration Discovery
**Revelation**: 47 members of Parliament had undergone shadow surgery
