# Conjuration School of Magic
*The Art of Summoning, Creation, and Transportation*

> *"In the boundless depths where distance means nothing and everything, conjuration becomes the art of bringing forth what is needed when it is needed. We do not merely move objects through space - we convince reality that they were always meant to be here."*
> — [[Master Conductor Nereus Voidcaller]], Dean of Extraplanar Studies at the [[Deep Current Academy]]

## Overview

Conjuration represents one of the most versatile and practically essential schools of magic across both [[Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos]], encompassing the arts of summoning, creation, and transportation. In the vast underwater realm where distances are measured in crushing leagues and resources can be scarce, conjuration has evolved into sophisticated systems of logistics, defense, and exploration that enable civilization to thrive in hostile environments.

The school's principles center on the manipulation of space, time, and dimensional barriers to bring forth creatures, objects, and energies from elsewhere, or to create them from magical force. Conjuration operates through the fundamental understanding that reality has gaps and connections that can be exploited by skilled practitioners to transport, summon, or create what is needed.

In [[Aquabyssos]], conjuration has developed unique characteristics due to the three-dimensional nature of underwater space and the proximity to cosmic forces. Practitioners have mastered techniques for summoning creatures adapted to extreme pressure, creating temporary structures that can withstand the crushing depths, and establishing transportation networks that span the ocean's vertical and horizontal dimensions.

The school serves multiple crucial functions in underwater society: supplying remote settlements with necessary resources, summoning aid during emergencies, creating temporary structures for exploration and construction, and establishing communication and transportation links across vast distances. The mastery of conjuration magic has been essential to [[Aquabyssos]]'s expansion and survival in the hostile deep ocean environment.

Advanced conjuration practitioners can summon beings from other planes of existence, create semi-permanent structures and objects, establish permanent portals between locations, and even briefly manipulate time and space to achieve seemingly impossible logistical feats.

## Magical Theory and Principles

Conjuration magic operates on the fundamental principle that reality contains spaces between spaces - dimensional gaps and connections that can be accessed and manipulated by skilled practitioners. These gaps allow for the transportation of matter and energy across vast distances or from other planes of existence.

### Core Theoretical Framework

**Dimensional Accessibility**: Conjuration works by identifying and accessing the thin places where different dimensions touch or overlap. These dimensional interfaces can be temporarily widened or stabilized to allow passage of creatures, objects, or energy between locations or planes.

**Summoning Resonance**: The calling forth of creatures operates through establishing sympathetic resonance between the caster and target entities. This resonance creates a temporary connection that allows the practitioner to extend their will across dimensional boundaries and convince entities to answer their summons.

**Creation Theory**: The formation of objects and effects from pure magical energy follows principles of materialization, where focused will and magical power combine to give temporary or permanent form to conceptual patterns. More complex creations require greater understanding of the object's essential nature.

**Spatial Manipulation**: Transportation magic works by convincing reality that the target was always meant to be in the destination location. This requires careful magical programming to avoid catastrophic interactions with existing matter or energy at the target location.

### Underwater Adaptations

**Pressure Integration**: [[Aquabyssos]] conjuration incorporates ocean pressure as both a limitation and an enhancement to summoning magic. Creatures summoned from other planes must be adapted to survive crushing depths, while pressure differentials can be used to enhance transportation effects.

**Three-Dimensional Navigation**: Unlike surface conjuration that primarily works in horizontal space, underwater magic has been adapted to function efficiently in full three-dimensional environments where "up" and "down" have crucial importance for survival and navigation.

**Void Resonance**: The proximity to cosmic forces has allowed [[Aquabyssos]] conjurers to establish connections with extraplanar entities that exist in void space, creating unique summoning opportunities but also increased risks of attracting unwanted attention.

**Crystal Network Integration**: Crystalline formations throughout [[Aquabyssos]] can be used as anchor points for conjuration magic, allowing for more stable and long-distance transportation effects and serving as permanent summoning circles for regular use.

### Advanced Applications

**Planar Embassy**: Master conjurers can establish semi-permanent connections to other planes, creating embassy-like spaces where entities from different dimensions can meet and interact safely.

**Temporal Logistics**: Advanced practitioners can manipulate the timing of conjuration effects, storing summoned objects or creatures in temporal suspension until needed, or pre-casting effects to trigger at predetermined times.

**Collective Summoning**: Multiple conjurers working together can summon entities or create effects far beyond what any individual practitioner could achieve, sharing the magical burden and creating more stable results.

**Captain Depth Quartermaster**: Expert in creation magic who can generate supplies and equipment for expeditions and settlements. Her innovations in temporary structure creation have enabled exploration of previously unreachable ocean regions.

## Forbidden and Lost Spells

### Void Summoning Experiments
Early attempts to summon entities directly from void space resulted in catastrophic failures that created permanent dimensional scars. These techniques are now forbidden due to the risk of attracting cosmic attention or allowing void corruption to spread through dimensional connections.

**The Great Summoning Disaster**: A historical attempt to summon a void lord to serve as a protector resulted in the creation of the [[Mourning Depths]], a region where reality remains unstable. This event led to strict regulations on cosmic-level conjuration.

**Temporal Paradox Summons**: Spells that attempt to summon versions of living people from alternate timelines or different time periods. These are forbidden due to the risk of creating temporal paradoxes or consciousness fragmentation.

### Lost Creation Techniques
Ancient knowledge of permanent object creation that required no ongoing magical energy has been lost to time. These techniques were said to create objects indistinguishable from naturally occurring materials, leading to speculation about their use in ancient construction projects.

**Permanent Portal Mastery**: The original techniques for creating completely stable portals that required no maintenance have been lost. Modern portal networks require constant attention from skilled practitioners, while ancient ruins contain portal archways that continue functioning despite millennia of neglect.

**Consciousness Transfer Summoning**: Legendary spells that could summon the consciousness of deceased individuals or transfer living minds between bodies. These techniques were reportedly used during the early history of [[Aquabyssos]] but have been lost to time and regulation.
