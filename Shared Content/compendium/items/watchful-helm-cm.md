# Watchful Helm
*Wondrous Item, very rare (requires attunement)*  

- **Properties**: [Requires Attunement](/rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement)
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

While you wear this helm, you gain a +1 bonus to AC and remain aware of your surroundings even while you're asleep, and you have advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.

As a bonus action, you can cast the [see invisibility](/compendium/spells/see-invisibility.md) spell from the helm. Once this property of the helm is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
