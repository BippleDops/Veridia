- Hope should exist (barely) --- *"She dreams, and in dreaming, we exist. She wakes, and in waking, we end. She is the depths below depth, the dark before light, the silence after the last word. She is the Deep Mother, and She is coming home."*
- Final Entry, Chronicle of the Last Days ## Player-Facing Summary Deep Mother Subsystem is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Deep Mother Subsystem as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Deep Mother Subsystem. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Secret Pact - Summon ancient evil ## Plot Hooks - Strange disappearances suggest a conspiracy

- An heirloom has gone missing and war looms
- A merchant needs help delivering before the festival
