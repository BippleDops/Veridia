## Special Traits
**Link to Creator:** A yellow musk zombie can never move more than 200 feet away from the [[Yellow Musk Creeper|yellow musk creeper]] that created it. If it is forced to do so, it dies. The exception to this restriction is when the yellow musk creeper separates from the zombie so the zombie can seek out a location for a new creeper to take root.

## Actions
**Fist or Weapon:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d8+2`) bludgeoning damage (type can vary by weapon)

## Description
Yellow musk zombies are creatures that have been transformed into their current state by a [[Yellow Musk Creeper|yellow musk creeper]]. The yellow musk zombie appears much as it did in life, wearing the same clothes and carrying the same weapons it had at the time of its transformation. Yellow musk zombies have pale yellow skin and stark white eyes. They are attuned to the yellow musk creeper that created them by the many thin, ivylike vines growing from their flesh. This attunement prevents them from moving more than 200 feet away from the creeper. If a zombie is forced to exceed that distance, it dies.

About two months after its transformation, the zombie is “ripe.” At that time, the yellow musk creeper turns it loose, and the zombie wanders up to a mile away from its parent creeper and dies. Where it falls, new yellow musk seedlings sprout from the corpse, and within one hour, a fully grown yellow musk creeper blooms.
