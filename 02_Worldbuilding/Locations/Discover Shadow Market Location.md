## Overview
A covert investigation quest where players must locate the hidden Shadow Market - a black market operating in the depths of Aquabyssos. This underground network deals in forbidden artifacts, illegal memory trades, and contraband from the surface world.

Success requires careful information gathering, building trust with criminal contacts, and avoiding detection by city authorities who have been trying to shut down the market for years.

## Investigation Methods
**Information Gathering**: Interview dock workers, tavern patrons, and known criminals
**Following Leads**: Track suspicious shipments and midnight meetings
**Building Trust**: Complete small favors for underworld contacts
**Stealth Operations**: Shadow suspects to meeting locations

## Adventure Hooks
1. Player needs specific illegal item or service
2. Investigation into missing person leads here
3. Character's criminal contact offers information trade

### Key Locations
1. Main entrance/approach
2. Central gathering area
3. Important buildings/features
4. Defensive positions (if applicable)
5. Hidden or secret areas

## DM Notes
