*Mobile Law Enforcement in the Deep* > *"The Depth Wardens are the current that carries justice to every corner of Aquabyssos. Where the law is needed, there they flow. Where order must be maintained, there they stand firm. They are the pressure that keeps our realm stable, the guardians who ensure that darknessâ€”whether from the depths or from the hearts of wrongdoersâ€”does not overwhelm the light."*

> â€” [[Commander Drake Pressureborn|02 Worldbuilding/People/Commander Drake Pressureborn, Chief of Depth Warden Operations ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview Depth Warden Patrols are the mobile enforcement units that maintain law and order throughout the vast expanses of [Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]. Unlike stationary guard posts or fortress garrisons, these patrols move constantly through the underwater realm, following established routes and responding to calls for assistance across multiple depth zones. They serve as the visible presence of Aquabyssos law enforcement, representing both protection for law-abiding citizens and a deterrent to those who would disturb the peace. Each patrol consists of 4-8 trained Depth Wardens led by a Patrol Sergeant, equipped with specialized gear for operating at various depths and pressure levels. They travel in formation through designated patrol corridors, investigating disturbances, conducting routine inspections, assisting travelers in distress, and maintaining the security of trade routes and civilian areas. Depth Warden Patrols operate under the authority of [[The Depth Wardens|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/The Depth Wardens, the primary law enforcement organization of Aquabyssos, and work in coordination with local authorities, merchant groups, and civilian communities. Their presence throughout the realm ensures that even the most remote settlements and isolated travelers have access to protection and legal assistance. The patrols serve multiple functions beyond simple law enforcement: they act as information gatherers, emergency responders, diplomatic contacts for foreign visitors, and mobile representatives of Aquabyssos governmental authority. Their constant movement and wide-ranging duties make them one of the most visible and important institutions in maintaining the stability and security of the underwater realm. ### Standard Patrol Composition **Patrol Sergeant** (1 per patrol):
