# Shadow Bloom

The dark grows thick as water around the ship. Every motion leaves a trailing shadow that doesnâ€™t quite follow.

What you feel
- Cold pressure on the ears
- Lantern light shrinking
- A hum under the deck like distant singing

What you can try
- Steady yourselves (Wisdom save)
- Watch your instruments (someone scans)
- Sing together (if you know a hymn)

Possible outcomes
- You push through, steadied by each other
- Someone falters and needs help
- The ship grows quiet, as if listening
