## Description
According to ancient texts, an arcane creature known only as the Shadow Lord created beings of living darkness to aid him and protect him. These beings, called shadows, were formed through a combination of darkness and evil. He also created lesser beings of darkness, not as powerful as his favored creations. These creatures are known as lesser shadows. Though not as powerful as shadows, lesser shadows are every bit as evil. Until it moves, a lesser shadow is indistinguishable from any mundane shadow.

Lesser shadows hide in darkness, springing to attack when living opponents wander too close. They are often led in combat by a shadow. Unlike full shadows, lesser shadows do not spawn additional shadows. It is rumored that such a lesser shadow might exist, but none have been proven.
