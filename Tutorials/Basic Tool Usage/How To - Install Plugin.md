## Do Plugins Store Data I Should Care About?
YES! There are some plugins that store lots of data in the plugin folder. Pretty much any plugin by Javalent will use a file called data.json and store it in the plugin folder. In some cases these store a tonne of very useful and important data. Such as pin configurations for maps and the monsters you use in the statblock and initiative tracker plugins. For the most part you don't need to know these are here. But if you were to move to a new vault then this data would need to be copied or backed up.
