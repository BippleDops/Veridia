# Shadowcat (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *illusion*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a black pearl worth at least 100 gp and a cat’s claw)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour


## Effects
You create a cat made of semi-solid shadow. You have full telepathic control over it and can use your action to see, hear, and speak through it. While seeing through the cat’s eyes, you have darkvision to 60 feet.

The cat is an object that has AC 15, a speed of 40, hit points equal to your hit point maximum, and has immunity to bludgeon-ing, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing, has the Stealth skill using your proficiency bonus and has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) ability checks, can take the Hide action as a bonus action when in dim light or darkness. Finally, the cat can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, and takes 1d10 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. The cat cannot attack but otherwise has the attributes of a normal cat (*Monster Manual,* pg. 320).
