## Overview
New Thalassopolis, the de facto capital of [[Aquabyssos]], is a haunting merger of drowned architecture and new construction, built within and around the sunken ruins of the original surface metropolis. The city exists in the Twilight Depth, where the last rays of sunlight create an eternal blue-green dusk, and bioluminescent organisms provide additional illumination.

### The Rings of Depth
The city is organized in concentric rings, each deeper than the last:

### The Drowned Cathedral
Once Thalassopolis's greatest temple, now a center of dark worship:
- Filled with "breathing water" that sustains both air and water breathers
- Stained glass windows that show different scenes based on depth pressure
- Altar that transforms offerings into memories
- Bells that still ring, creating bubbles that carry prayers

### The Memory Exchange
The city's economic heart where memories are traded as currency:
- Extraction chambers for memory removal
- Valuation experts who price experiences
- Memory vaults storing millions of experiences
- Black market for forbidden or stolen memories
- Connection to surface world memory smuggling

### The Inverted Towers
Skyscrapers from the original city that now hang upside down:
- Gravity works differently inside each tower
- Noble families claim different towers
- Some towers phase between existence and void
- The tallest tower's "top" (now bottom) reaches the Hadean Depth

### The Coral Palace
Secondary seat of government when the Empress is elsewhere:
- Built from transformed bodies of drowning victims
- Whispers prophecies through the walls
- Grows larger with each death in the city
- Houses the Tidal Council meetings
- Contains the Depth Throne (lesser version of Obsidian Throne)

### The Academy of Deep Magic
Where the transformed learn to manipulate reality:
- Pressure chambers for spell practice
- Memory libraries containing centuries of knowledge
- Void swimming pools for advanced students
- Transformation labs for voluntary subjects
- Exchange program with surface mages (who rarely return unchanged)

### The Depth Clock Conspiracy
The massive clock in the Core is counting down to something. Different factions have different theories:
- Return of the Things That Dwell Beneath
- The Second Drowning
- Convergence of all Empress Tethys versions
- Opening of permanent surface portals

### The Surface Infiltration
Increasing numbers of agents being sent to Aethermoor:
- Establishing cells in [[Port Meridian]]
- Corrupting water supplies with transformation magic
- Recruiting desperate surface dwellers
- Searching for the [[The Seven Shards]]

### Memory Black Market
Illegal trade in stolen or forbidden memories:
- Surface world military secrets
- Pre-Drowning historical records
- Memories of the Things That Dwell Beneath
- Experiences of dying and returning

### The Transformation Plague
Some citizens are transforming beyond even Hadean levels:
- Becoming living water
- Merging with architecture
- Developing collective consciousness
- Attracting attention from below

## DM Secrets
> [!danger] The City Lives
> New Thalassopolis isn't just built on the old city - the original city is still alive, transformed into a massive organism. The buildings are organs, the streets are veins, and the citizens are parasites or symbionts. It dreams, and those dreams affect reality.

> [!warning] The Convergence Point
> The city exists in multiple dimensions simultaneously. Versions of it exist at every depth, and they're slowly merging. When they fully converge, it will create a portal large enough to bring the Things That Dwell Beneath to the surface.

> [!info] The Memory Core
> Deep beneath the city is a crystallized mass of all memories from the original drowning. If accessed, it would grant godlike knowledge but would also overwhelm any mind, creating a new Thing That Dwells Beneath.

### The Depth Codes
1. **Transformation is Sacred**: Resisting transformation is punishable by forced rapid change
2. **Memory as Currency**: Stealing memories equals theft, creating false memories equals counterfeiting
3. **Depth Respect**: Lower depths have authority over higher
4. **The Drowning Truth**: Speaking of the surface as superior is heresy
5. **Pressure Rights**: Claiming space based on pressure resistance

## Player-Facing Summary

## Lore Details

2. Central gathering area
3. Important buildings/features
4. Defensive positions (if applicable)

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
