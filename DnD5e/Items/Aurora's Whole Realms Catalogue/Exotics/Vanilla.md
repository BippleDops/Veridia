## Description
Words cannot describe the delicate flavors of this wondrous spice, certain to become a favorite throughout all Toril. From the deep jungles of Maztica comes this strange bean of exotic orchids, hand-picked by natives of those distant lands. I import only the finest beans, sealed in individual [[Beakers|vials]] to preserve the delicate essences. (100 gp per bean)
