## Quotes
- "The shadow remembers what the light forgets."
- "Seven shards, seven sins, seven salvations. But which is which?"
- "You seek answers in the depths? Be careful—some depths seek you in return."

## DM Notes
Sister Morwyn serves as a bridge between the material and shadow planes, offering both mystical guidance and practical warnings. She can provide crucial information about the Shards but always at a price—usually in the form of unsettling revelations or dangerous tasks in the Shadowmere.
