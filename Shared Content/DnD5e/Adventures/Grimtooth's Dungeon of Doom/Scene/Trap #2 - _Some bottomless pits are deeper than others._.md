# Trap #2 - "Some bottomless pits are deeper than others."
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> If the party can come up with 225 feet of rope they can move on to the next part of this torterous endeavour. (Keep in mind if they use the elven rope they will be 25 feet short and will have to climb back up the rope to get more, and then back down again.)
> 
> The "bottom" of the shaft is filled to a deth of 4 feet with water, this despite the fact that the capstone was very tight, and the shaft coming down showed no obvoius leaks. As the intrepid delver on the end of the rope reaches the bottom he will be confronted with a set of two 5 foot wide 10 feet tall, graven stone, doors, half submerged under the water. They are inset into the wall. If he is able to sense magic he will note a low level spell on them, if not he will note they are locked somehow so that his strength is uneque to the task of opening them. A magic user with a skill sufficient to open a locked door will have to come down and help out. With any luckj the mage will come down the same way as everyone else... head first!
> 
> The trap is operated by the unlocking of the doors, which are in fact just two stone slabs carved by dwarvish craftsmen into the wall of the shaft. The lock in reality holds the floor of the shaft in place. When the unlocking spell is performed, a latch is released which permits the thing stone covered metal plate that is in the floor to plummet into the depths a further 75 feet down!
> 
> This trap is rated at Two Skulls. A high level wizard may be able to fly, or levitate himself out of danger. Furthermore a delver with foresight enough to tie himself with the rope will only drop a short way and bump his nose on the wall of the shaft. There is insufficient carving on the doors to grasp. There is a 30% chance a delver might save himself by grabbing the dangling rope. (L3)
> 
> The final descent of 300 feet overall, or an additional 75 feet from Trap #2, will bring the party to a rubble filled bottom with the same 4 feet of water in it. (Not to metion the corpses of those who fell victim to the previoous trap.). They will again be confronting a 5 foot wide 10 foot high set of dwarvish crafted doors which radiate a low level of magic. 
> 
> There should be a fair amount of consternation among the delvers when they find themselves in the same position as the doors above. This will result in a number of precautions being taken, which when the magic is employed to "unlock" the doors again will prove needless. 
> 
> The doors will open into a room 40 feet wide and 30 feet deep. The water from the shaft will spill out over the floor. The walls are covered with stucco and painted with a variety of the scenes of Evinrood's greatest successes. Not more thant 6 feet away from the wall opposite [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] is a raised stone pedestal, upon which rests, undisturbed an ornately carved coffin on pale stone. The designs on its surface are geometrical only, not scenes. 
> 
> At this point it is only fair to tell any magic users they sense an uncomfortable "background magic" in this room. This will continue throughout the dungeon. It is not enough to impair their ability to sense magic or operate in any way, but it is there. It is analogous to turning on a light in a room that is brightly lit by sunlight, it doesn't add measurably to the ambient light in the room, but it is there. This is the mantenance spell, set by Evinrood to keep the daemons whhich the surce sent to claim him at bay. 
> 
> Above the coffin is a roundel also painted on the stucco. In it the first character who enters sees what is clearly the images of him or herseld dying in a number of hideous fashions! The images will change as a new character enters the Tomb. They each will see the images of themselves dying in a variety of different ways. This is a great opportunity to apply psychological pressure on the delvers. The images can shgow a character transfixed with arrows, ground into a hamburger, sliced into convenient bits, drowning, burning, or in the grasp of dimly defined creatures who are ripping him apart. Limit yourseld to trap results actually available in the Tomb. Furthermore if one or more characters have already died in the first two traps show their images too after everyone else has entered, but their image will be as the party saw them at the point of their demise. This will serve to further reinforce the point If you link the traps available and the delvers you may eventually actually match up a victim to a trap. At that point you can recall the image to the minds of the party. Or bener still when the party enters the environs of a given trap you can indicate that this looks like an area remembered from the images this will serve to make party members hesitant to rush headlong into a "foredoomed" situation.
