# Aquathys: The Sunken Empire Reborn
*Where ancient magic meets the endless deep*

## Overview

Aquathys is a vast underwater continent that exists in a parallel space beneath the ocean's surface, accessible through specific portal points scattered across the seafloor. Once a surface empire that rivaled the greatest civilizations, it was deliberately sunk 3,000 years ago to escape a prophesied calamity. The inhabitants adapted through powerful magic, transforming themselves and their society to thrive beneath the waves.

## The Great Submersion

Three millennia ago, the Oracle of [[Crystalline Depths]] foresaw the coming of the **Void Plague** - a magical catastrophe that would consume all surface life. The Emperor [[Thalassius the Wise]] made the ultimate sacrifice, using the **Heart of Oceanus** to sink the entire continent, saving his people but forever changing their destiny.
