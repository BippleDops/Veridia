# Enervation (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 6 hours


## Effects
A black beam of enervating energy springs from your finger towards a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target gains 1d4+1 levels of exhaustion, it takes 2d10 necrotic damage, and its hit points are reduced by that amount. If the target already has one or more levels of exhaustion, this spell cannot take him past the fifth level. If the hit point reduction takes the target to 0 hit points, it dies. This exhaustion and hit point reduction last for 6 hours or until the target takes a long rest.
