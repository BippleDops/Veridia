--- # Dancing Lights

*cantrip, Illusion* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute You create up to four torch-size lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover for the duration. Alternatively, you combine the four lights into one glowing Medium form that is vaguely humanlike. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds [[Light Xphb]] in a 10-foot radius. As a [[Action Xphb]], you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a space within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light vanishes if it exceeds the spell's range. **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 259.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of dancing lights xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around dancing lights xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - An heirloom has gone missing and truth emerges
