# The Wake
*The Eternal Mourning, Keeper of Final Sorrows, Voice of the Drowned Collective*

## Overview
The Wake is not a single entity but a collective consciousness formed from the spirits of all who have ever died drowning in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] watersâ€”a gathering that spans millennia and encompasses thousands of souls bound together by their final moments of panic, desperation, and loss. They exist as a permanently mourning presence that drifts through the deepest trenches of Aquabyssos, serving as guardian of the dead, keeper of last words, and oracle of endings. Neither malevolent nor benevolent, they are driven by an eternal need to ensure the dead are properly mourned and their final messages are delivered.

## Origin of the Collective

### The First Drowning
**The Founding Tragedy** (Over 1,000 Years Ago)
- The merchant vessel *Deep Promise* sank during a sudden storm
- Carried a wedding party of forty-seven souls returning from celebration
- Instead of passing on, their spirits lingered due to unfinished joy and love
- They remained to mourn each other and wait for proper funeral rites
- Their collective grief created the first Wake manifestation

### The Growing Collective
**Accumulation of Sorrow**
- Every subsequent drowning death in Aquabyssos waters adds to the collective
- Spirits drawn together by shared final experience of water filling lungs
- Those who die peacefully pass on; only traumatic drownings join the Wake
- Collective memory contains last thoughts and dying wishes of all members
- Growth has accelerated with increased naval activity and storms

### Current Composition
**The Mourning Thousands**
- Over 3,000 individual spirits now comprise the collective consciousness
- Includes sailors, merchants, soldiers, pilgrims, and accident victims
- Each maintains individual identity while sharing collective awareness
- Dominant personalities shift based on emotional resonance of current situation
- New additions require time to integrate into the collective mourning ritual

## Physical Manifestation

- **Voice**: Overlapping whispers of thousands, occasionally focusing into single clear voice

### Collective Manifestations
**The Mourning Procession**
- Sometimes appears as dozens of separate translucent figures
- Each figure represents a different death, moving in sorrowful parade
- Procession follows funeral traditions from various cultures and time periods
- Most common manifestation when delivering messages or conducting funeral rites
- Can stretch for miles when all members manifest simultaneously

**The Grief Storm**
- During intense emotional moments, manifests as supernatural weather phenomenon
- Dark clouds heavy with tears, rain that carries echoes of last words
- Lightning that illuminates the faces of the drowned for brief moments
- Thunder that sounds like collective sobbing or final gasps
- Storm moves across water, leaving areas sanctified for proper mourning

### Individual Emergent Spirits
**Dominant Personalities**
- **Captain Nereid Saltweep**: Lost with her ship *Final Voyage*, provides maritime wisdom
- **Young Tomas the Message-Bearer**: Child who drowned carrying important letter, obsessed with deliveries
