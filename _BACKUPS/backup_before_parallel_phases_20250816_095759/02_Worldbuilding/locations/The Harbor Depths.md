## Overview
The Harbor Depths represent the submerged underbelly of [[Port Meridian, where the bustling surface port gives way to a treacherous underwater realm. This transition zone between [Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos contains sunken ships, ancient ruins from before the great submersion, and the dangerous meeting point between two very different worlds. Crystal corruption seeps up from below while surface pollutants sink down, creating a unique and hazardous environment.

### Depth Zones

**The Shallows (0-20m)**
- Pier foundations and dock supports
- Clear water with good visibility
- Regular naval patrols and harbor traffic
- Safe for experienced divers with proper equipment

**The Twilight Zone (20-100m)**
- Sunken vessels and underwater ruins
- First signs of crystal corruption
- Reduced visibility, dangerous currents
- Domain of [Independent Smugglers|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/Independent Smugglers]]

**The Shadow Depths (100-200m)**
- Ancient pre-submersion city ruins
- Heavy crystal contamination
- Home to depth-touched creatures
- Border region with [[Aquabyssos territory
