Duke Cyrus Reefheart leads the [[Coral Courts from [Lumengarde|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Lumengarde]], championing biological adaptation as the future of [[Aquabyssos World Overview|Aquabyssos. His body is a living artwork of symbiotic modification - coral grows from his shoulders, bioluminescent patterns pulse beneath his translucent skin, and small fish swim through hollow chambers in his torso. What remains human is beautiful in an alien way, but less of him is human each year. ## History

Born to ancient noble family that ruled the Coral Islands before drowning. Family was first to accept biological adaptation to survive. Cyrus took the process further than anyone, allowing complete symbiosis with coral palace. Has ruled Lumengarde for 89 years but appears ageless due to constant regeneration. ## Current Activities

1. Merging further with his palace-body
2. Developing adaptation to resist [The Deepmind]]
3. Negotiating trade disputes with [[Pressure's End|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Pressure's End]]
4. Spreading biological adaptation philosophy
5. Growing a "daughter" from his own biomass ## Secrets

> [!warning] DM Only
> - No longer has a human brain - consciousness distributed through colony
> - The Coral Courts are actually one super-organism he controls
> - Can infect others with symbiotic organisms through touch
> - Growing an army of bio-weapons in secret
> - Plans to forcibly adapt all of Aquabyssos "for their own good" ## Transformation Stages

1. **Year 1-10**: Minor coral growths, enhanced healing
2. **Year 11-30**: Bioluminescent skin, internal modifications
3. **Year 31-60**: Hollow chambers, symbiotic organs
4. **Year 61-89**: Current state - more colony than man
5. **Year 90+**: Complete merger with Lumengarde predicted ## Player-Facing Summary Duke Cyrus Reefheart is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Duke Cyrus Reefheart as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Duke Cyrus Reefheart. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Alliance - Manipulate succession ## Plot Hooks - A corpse reveals a betrayal about this place
