# Strixhaven Pennant
*Wondrous item, common*  



This magic pennant bears the symbol of Strixhaven or one of its colleges: Lorehold, Prismari, Quandrix, Silverquill, or Witherbloom. While you wave the pennant, the symbol on it glitters, and the pennant sheds bright light in a 10-foot-radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
