--- # Wilderness Chase Complications

*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 253* **Wilderness Chase Complications**`dice: [](wilderness-chase-complications.md#^wilderness-chase-complications)`| dice: d20 | Complication |
|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | Your path takes you through a rough patch of brush. Make a DC 10 Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) or Dexterity ([[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]) check (your choice) to get past the brush. On a failed check, the brush counts as 5 feet of difficult terrain. |
| 2 | Uneven ground threatens to slow your progress. Make a DC 10 Dexterity ([[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]) check to navigate the area. On a failed check, the ground counts as 10 feet of difficult terrain. |
| 3 | You run through a [[swarm-of-insects-xmm (beast)]] (see the Monster Manual for game statistics, with the DM choosing whichever kind of insects makes the most sense). The swarm makes an opportunity attack against you (+3 to hit;`4d4`piercing damage on a hit). |
| 4 | A stream, ravine, or rock bed blocks your path. Make a DC 10 Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) or Dexterity ([[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]) check (your choice) to cross the impediment. On a failed check, the impediment counts as 10 feet of difficult terrain. |
| 5 | Make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, you are blinded by blowing sand, dirt, ash, snow, or pollen until the end of your turn. While blinded in this way, your speed is halved. |
| 6 | A sudden drop catches you by surprise. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to navigate the impediment. On a failed save, you fall`1d4 Ã— 5`feet, taking`d6`bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen as normal, and land prone. |
| 7 | You blunder into a hunter's snare. Make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid it. On a failed save, you are caught in a net and restrained. See chapter 5 "Equipment," of the Player's Handbook for rules on escaping a net. |
| 8 | You are caught in a stampede of spooked animals. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, you are knocked about and take`d4`bludgeoning damage and`d4`piercing damage. |
| 9 | Your path takes you near a patch of razorvine. Make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or use 10 feet of movement (your choice) to avoid the razorvine. On a failed save, you take`d10`slashing damage. |
| 10 | A creature indigenous to the area chases after you. The DM chooses a creature appropriate for the terrain. |
| 11-20 | No complication. |
