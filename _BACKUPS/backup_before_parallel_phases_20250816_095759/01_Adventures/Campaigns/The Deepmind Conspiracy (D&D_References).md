The Deepmind Conspiracy alleges that powerful psionics are secretly manipulating Aquabyssos politics through mental influence and thought control. Believers claim a cabal of mind-readers and telepaths has infiltrated government, commerce, and religious institutions to create a hidden psychic oligarchy. ## Alleged Methods

**Subtle Influence:** Planting suggestions during normal conversation
**Memory Modification:** Altering recollections of important events
**Emotional Manipulation:** Controlling feelings to influence decisions
**Information Gathering:** Reading minds for blackmail material
**Identity Theft:** Assuming personalities through deep mental intrusion ## Evidence Presented

**Behavioral Patterns:** Politicians making inexplicable policy reversals
**Economic Anomalies:** Market manipulation requiring insider knowledge
**Social Trends:** Coordinated opinion shifts across diverse populations
**Individual Testimonies:** Citizens reporting memory gaps and compulsions
**Physical Artifacts:** Devices allegedly used for mass mental influence ## Investigation Challenges

**Mental Defenses:** True psionics could detect and thwart investigators
**Evidence Destruction:** Psychic manipulation leaves no physical traces
**Witness Reliability:** Memory modification makes testimony unreliable
**Infiltration Risk:** Investigators might be compromised unknowingly
**Public Credibility:** Conspiracy claims damage investigator reputation ## Potential Truth Scenarios

1. **Complete Fabrication:** No conspiracy exists, pure paranoia
2. **Limited Reality:** Small-scale psychic influence blown out of proportion
3. **Partial Truth:** Some individual psionics operating but no organized cabal
4. Additionally, **Full Conspiracy:** Extensive network exactly as described
5. **Misdirection:** Real conspiracy using false psychic narrative as cover ## Adventure Hooks

1. Investigation into specific conspiracy claims reveals deeper mysteries
2. Party members begin experiencing unexplained memory gaps
3. Alleged conspiracy victim requests protection and verification
4. Government contracts party to debunk or confirm conspiracy claims
5. Foreign agents seek party assistance in psychic intelligence gathering
6. Underground resistance recruits party to fight supposed mind controllers ## Social Impact

The conspiracy theory has increased paranoia and social tension. Mental protection charms sell briskly while citizens become suspicious of authority figures and even close associates. ## DM Notes

The Deepmind Conspiracy works whether true or false. If real, it provides shadowy antagonists operating through mental manipulation. If false, it creates social paranoia and investigative red herrings while exploring themes of trust and evidence. ## Player-Facing Summary The Deepmind Conspiracy is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Deepmind Conspiracy as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Deepmind Conspiracy. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Secret Pact - Summon ancient evil ## Related Notes - [[Similar Topic 1
