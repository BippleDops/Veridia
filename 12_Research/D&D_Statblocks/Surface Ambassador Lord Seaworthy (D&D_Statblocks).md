**Cultural Bridge.** Seaworthy has advantage on all Charisma-based checks when interacting with creatures from either surface or aquatic cultures. He can serve as translator for complex cultural concepts between the two realms.

**Naval Commander.** Seaworthy can use bonus actions to coordinate allies, granting them advantage on attack rolls or saving throws (3/day).

**Environmental Adaptation.** Magic allows Seaworthy to breathe water as easily as air and provides resistance to pressure and temperature changes. He can survive at any depth in Aquabyssos.

**Spellcasting.** Seaworthy is a 15th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 20, +12 to hit with spell attacks). He knows the following spells:

- **Cantrips (at will):** guidance, mending, message, prestidigitation, thaumaturgy

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Seaworthy makes two Diplomatic Resolution attempts or casts a spell and makes one diplomatic action.

**Diplomatic Resolution.** Seaworthy attempts to defuse hostility through negotiation. All creatures within 60 feet must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, hostile creatures become neutral toward Seaworthy's party for 1 minute and are willing to listen to reasonable proposals.

**Naval Command.** Seaworthy shouts tactical orders. All allies within 60 feet can immediately move up to their speed and make one attack with advantage.

**Treaty Invocation (1/Day).** Seaworthy calls upon existing diplomatic agreements. One creature within 30 feet must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, they are bound by diplomatic protocol and cannot attack or act hostilely toward Seaworthy's party for 24 hours unless directly threatened.

**Cultural Mediation (Recharge 5-6).** Seaworthy helps resolve cultural misunderstandings. All creatures within 30 feet gain advantage on their next Charisma check or saving throw and can understand each other perfectly for 10 minutes, regardless of language barriers.

### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)
Seaworthy can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.

**Move.** Seaworthy moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Diplomatic Insight.** Seaworthy makes an Insight check or uses detect thoughts.

**Command.** Seaworthy grants one ally within 60 feet advantage on their next action.

**Negotiate (Costs 2 Actions).** Seaworthy attempts Diplomatic Resolution or casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.

### Lair Actions
When encountered in the Surface Embassy or during formal diplomatic functions, Seaworthy can take lair actions on initiative count 20:

**Diplomatic Sanctuary.** The area becomes neutral ground. All creatures must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be unable to initiate hostile actions while in the embassy.

**Cultural Understanding.** All language barriers are temporarily removed, and creatures gain insight into each other's cultural perspectives, reducing hostility and increasing cooperation.

**Emergency Protocols.** Seaworthy can immediately contact surface or aquatic authorities for assistance, potentially changing the encounter's dynamics significantly.
