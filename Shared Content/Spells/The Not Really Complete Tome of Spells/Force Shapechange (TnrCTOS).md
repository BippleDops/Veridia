# Force Shapechange (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a hair from a lycan-thrope and a butterfly)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You point to one creature within range that you can see. If that creature is shapechanged, either through natural ability or by spell, that creature must make a Con-stitution saving throw or be forced back to its true shape and take 3d10 force damage from the forced change. If the creature succeeds on its saving throw, it takes half-damage. This spell has no effect on illusory disguises.
