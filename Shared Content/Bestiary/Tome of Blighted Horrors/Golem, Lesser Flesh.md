## Special Traits
**Berserk:** When a lesser flesh golem starts its turn with 26 or fewer hit points, it has a 1-in-6 chance of going berserk. A berserk golem attacks the nearest living creature it can reach. The construct’s creator can regain control over the golem, if he’s within 60 feet, by using an action and making a successful DC 15 Cha (Persuasion) check.

**Fear of Fire:** If the golem takes fire damage, it has tactical disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.

**Lightning Absorption:** Each point of lightning damage that hits the golem heals 1 hit point.

**Magic Resistance:** A lesser flesh golem has tactical advantage on saving throws against magic. It is immune to effects that would alter its form.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The golem slams twice.

**Melee Attack—Slam:** +5 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d6 + 3` bludgeoning damage.

## Description
**Environment**: Any land

**Organization**: Solitary or pair

A lesser flesh golem is constructed from a whole cadaver or a number of humanoid body parts stitched together into a single composite form. It moves with a stiff-jointed gait as if not in complete control of its body. A lesser flesh golem typically stands 6 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds.

While most lesser flesh golems are mindless, some reanimate with a sliver of sentience, and with that spark comes memories of a previous life. The head and brain of such a lesser flesh golem must be just the right combination of fresh enough and (in its previous life) strong-willed, and even then luck and chance during the lesser flesh golem’s creation seem just as important in retaining the creature’s mind. These sentient flesh golems have the same stats as other lesser flesh golems, but can have Intelligence 6?16.

Lesser flesh golems cannot normally speak, but sentient lesser flesh golems retain the knowledge of one language they knew in life (usually Common). They have a difficult time expressing themselves in anything more than simple terms, but, in most cases, a sense of horror at their newfound state is easy to discern. With patient reeducation, they might be able to regain much of their former intellect.
