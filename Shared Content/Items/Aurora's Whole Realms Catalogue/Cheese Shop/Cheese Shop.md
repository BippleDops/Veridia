# Cheese Shop
## Overview
The cheeses of Faerun are as diverse as its cities, and range from the common “holed” cheese of Waterdeep and Cormyrian Cheddar to the spicy Chessentan Lotus and the exotic (and addictive) Luiren Spring Cheese. A quick tour through the various cheeses available in the Realms is a culinary tour of the peoples and cities that we trade with. 

Cheese is an excellent foodstuff for a long trip or extended visit. It stores well, travels without undue spoilage, and excites even the most common meal. It is equally well-suited to the winter meal by the hearth and the spring caravan trip. Cheese makes a perfect welcoming gift or parting memento. Cheese is sold by the 1 pound loaf or wheel or the 100 lb whey, unless otherwise noted. Buy in bulk and save!
