# Elminster's Effulgent Epuration (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *9th-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 90 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 hour


## Effects
You create a dozen floating silver spheres, each of which has the ability to absorb a single offensive spell. When you create them, and on subsequent rounds, you may use a bonus action to move the group of spheres up to 60 feet.

When a hostile spell is aimed at you or another creature, one sphere that is within 10 feet of the target will absorb the magic. It will then wink out of existence, taking the spell energy with it.

The spheres do not negate hostile magic that was already in the area, nor do they ab-sorb magic from non-hostile damaging spells (such as a *wall of fire*). The spheres do not negate the use of magic items, unless the item uses a charge to cast a spellâ€”it will ab-sorb a *magic missile* cast by a *wand of magic missiles* but will not protect someone from the necrotic damage inflicted by a *sword of life stealing*.
