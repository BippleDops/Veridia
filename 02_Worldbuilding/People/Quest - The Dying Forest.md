# Quest - The Dying Forest

**Level:** 5-8 | **Type:** Investigation/Environmental | **Duration:** 2-4 sessions

## Quest Overview
The ancient Silverleaf Forest outside Aethermoor is withering at an alarming rate, with trees blackening and wildlife fleeing. Druid Elara Moonwhisper believes a corruption spreads from the forest's heart, threatening not only the woodland but the entire region's magical balance.

## Quest Giver
**Druid Elara Moonwhisper** - Ancient elf guardian of the forest, desperate to save her sacred grove. She offers her staff of nature's blessing and knowledge of forest secrets as reward.

## Background
The Silverleaf Forest has stood for millennia, its magical trees providing protection and wonder to Aethermoor. Recent weeks brought reports of blackened branches, dying animals, and strange whispers in the wind. Local rangers refuse to venture deep into the woods after three scouts disappeared.

## Initial Information
- Trees die from the inside out, bark turning coal-black
- Animals exhibit aggressive, unnatural behavior before fleeing
- Strange purple mist seen drifting between diseased trees
- Ancient stone markers throughout forest show cracks
- Local farmers report nightmares and crop failures

## Investigation Phase
**Forest Edge Discoveries:**
- Dead ranger patrol with no obvious wounds
- Corrupted wildlife attacking on sight
- Trail markers deliberately destroyed
- Unnatural silence in affected areas

**Deep Forest Findings:**
- Ancient ritual circle with broken protective stones
- Aberrant symbols carved into dying tree trunks
- Underground cave system emanating corruption
- Twisted fey creatures serving unknown master

## The Source
**The Blighted Heart:** Deep within the forest lies a corrupted World Tree, infected by Far Realm energy leaked through a planar rift. The corruption spreads through root networks, transforming the forest into an aberrant ecosystem.

### Primary Antagonist
**The Whisper Grove:** Collective consciousness of corrupted dryads and treants, led by the fallen archdruid Malachar who opened the rift seeking greater power.

## Key Encounters
1. **Corrupted Grove Guardian** (CR 6) - Twisted treant blocking forest path
2. **Aberrant Animal Pack** (CR 4) - Mutated wolves with psychic abilities
3. **The Blighted Dryads** (CR 7) - Three corrupted forest spirits
4. **Malachar the Fallen** (CR 8) - Final boss in the corrupted World Tree

## Challenges and Obstacles
- **Environmental:** Toxic spores requiring Constitution saves
- **Navigation:** Shifting paths and illusions hiding true routes
- **Madness:** Exposure to Far Realm energy causes temporary insanity
- **Time Pressure:** Corruption spreads 1 mile per day

## Multiple Solutions
**Purification Route:** Gather rare herbs to create cleansing ritual (requires Nature/Medicine)
**Sealing Route:** Close the planar rift using arcane knowledge (requires Arcana/Investigation)
**Combat Route:** Destroy corruption source through direct confrontation
**Diplomatic Route:** Redeem Malachar through persuasion and restoration magic

## Rewards
**Monetary:** 2,000 gp from grateful citizens and government
**Magical:** Staff of Nature's Blessing, Cloak of Elvenkind, Potion of Greater Healing (x3)
**Social:** Hero status in Aethermoor, access to druidic lore
**Environmental:** Restored forest provides ongoing benefits to region

## Complications
- Corrupted animals follow party back to civilization
- Other adventuring party already in forest with different agenda
- Government wants to burn entire forest to stop spread
- Fey court demands party answer for disturbing their realm
- Malachar's corruption was actually containing worse evil

## Follow-up Adventures
