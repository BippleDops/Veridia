## Description
All our laboratory glassware is made of finest-quality, fire-hardened glass, crafted in Urmlaspyr by members of the glass-blowers guild. Vials (1 sp each) fit easily in vial racks, and are perfect for experimenting with small quantities of liquid or powder. 

Our beakers come in small (5 sp), medium (1 gp), and large (3 gp) sizes. We stock glass tubing in two-foot lengths (2 sp) that can be cut to size or fired and bent. We carry one specialized piece of glass tubingâ€”the distilling coil (5 gp), which is fully compatible with our other tubing. 

Of course, we also carry corks for all of these containers, offering whole stoppers (5 cp), stoppers drilled for tubing (8 cp), and corks meant to connect two sections of tubing (1 sp).

## Additional Details
18 vials; 6 beakers of each size; 10 two-foot lengths of tubing, 3 distilling coils, and 18 corks of each type are required for a complete lab.
