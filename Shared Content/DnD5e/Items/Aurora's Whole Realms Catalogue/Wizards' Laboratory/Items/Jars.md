## Description
Most wizards like to keep a vast cache of spell components and alchemical ingredients on hand. To do so they need an array of jars and corks. We offer jars of ceramic (made in Tilverton) and glass (made in Urmlaspyr), charging twice the listed cost for glass. All our jars— six ounce (8 cp), twelve ounce (1 sp), quart (2 sp), half-gallon (3 sp), gallon (5 sp), two gallon (1 gp), five gallon (2 gp), and ten gallon (3 gp)— come with cork stoppers that seal them tightly.

## Additional Details
40 six-ounce, 40 12-ounce, 10 quart, 5 half-gallon, 15 gallon, 10 five-gallon, and 5 ten-gallon jars are needed for a complete laboratory
