- Secret meetings with unidentified contacts
- Encoded messages hidden in diplomatic correspondence
- Family members acting evasively when questioned **The Truth Behind the Mystery**: Lysandra is actually a triple agent - recruited by Shadow Conspiracy through family threats, but working for Counter-Intelligence to expose the infiltration network. Her "suspicious" behavior is maintaining her cover while trying to protect both her family and her mission. #### Investigation Scenes **Scene 1: The Private Meeting**

Ambassador Lysandra's office feels different than yesterday. The formal diplomatic decorations seem staged, and she keeps glancing toward the door. "I need your help with something... Delicate.

Alone, and tell no one." **Investigation Opportunities**:

- Search her office while she's distracted (risky but informative)
