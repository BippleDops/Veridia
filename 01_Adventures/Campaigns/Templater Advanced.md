--- # Templater Advanced *"Master the pattern, and reality bends to your will."* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview Templater Advanced represents the pinnacle of magical templating techniques, a sophisticated spellcrafting discipline that allows practitioners to create reusable magical patterns or "templates" that can be quickly deployed and customized for various situations. This advanced form of magic combines elements of enchantment, transmutation, and divination to create semi-autonomous magical constructs that can adapt to changing circumstances. Unlike basic templating which relies on rigid, pre-determined magical formulas, Advanced Templating incorporates dynamic variables and conditional logic into spell construction. Master templaters can create magical frameworks that automatically adjust their effects based on environmental conditions, target characteristics, or user intent, making this one of the most versatile magical disciplines available. ## Historical Background The art of Advanced Templating emerged from the collaborative magical research conducted between Aquabyssos and Aethermoor scholars during the early periods of inter-realm contact. Surface mages contributed structured, academic approaches to spell construction, while underwater practitioners brought fluid, intuitive methodologies that could adapt to the ocean's ever-changing conditions. The breakthrough came when Archmage Torrent Patternweave successfully created the first "living template" - a spell pattern that could modify itself based on feedback from its environment. This discovery revolutionized magical practice, leading to the establishment of the Advanced Templating Academy and the development of increasingly sophisticated pattern-crafting techniques. ## Current State Advanced Templating is now practiced by elite mages in both realms, though the techniques require years of study and exceptional magical aptitude to master. The discipline has evolved into several specialized branches, including Combat Templating for rapid battlefield adaptations, Social Templating for complex diplomatic magic, and Environmental Templating for large-scale magical infrastructure projects. Modern practitioners work closely with magical engineers to integrate templating techniques into permanent installations, creating adaptive magical systems that can respond to changing conditions without direct oversight. This has led to the development of self-regulating magical defenses, adaptive transportation networks, and responsive environmental control systems. ### Aquabyssos

Advanced Templating perfectly suits the fluid nature of underwater society. Aquabyssos mages use it to create adaptable magical systems that respond to changing currents, pressure variations, and the dynamic nature of ocean life. The Pearl Palace's magical infrastructure relies heavily on advanced templating to maintain comfort and functionality across varying depths. ### Aethermoor

Surface practitioners appreciate the precision and reliability that advanced templating brings to magical endeavors. Academic institutions use templating techniques for research applications, while military organizations employ combat templating for strategic advantages in warfare and defense. ## Adventure Hooks 1. **The Runaway Template**: An experimental template has begun modifying itself beyond its creator's control

2. **Template Theft**: Someone is stealing and corrupting advanced templates for unknown purposes
3. **The Pattern War**: Two schools of templating compete to prove their methodology superior through magical duels ## Secrets (DM Only) The most advanced templates actually tap into the same fundamental forces that maintain the barriers between Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. Master templaters unknowingly strengthen or weaken these barriers with their work, potentially affecting the stability of both realms. ## Campaign Use Advanced Templating provides excellent opportunities for puzzle-solving, magical research quests, and complex problem-solving scenarios. Use it to create adaptive magical environments that challenge players to think creatively about spell use and magical theory. The discipline can serve as both a powerful tool and a source of magical complications. ## Player-Facing Summary Templater Advanced is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Templater Advanced as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Templater Advanced. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
