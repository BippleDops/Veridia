# Drawmij's Instant Exit (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 10 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a miniature silver door decorated worth 500 gp)

**Duration**: 1 round


## Effects
You open an extradimensional door in a wall or other flat surface that remains open for one round. When the door closes, you and anyone else who passed through the door are teleported to a completely random location within 250 yards. You will be let out at ground level, but there is no guarantee that you will be placed somewhere safe.
