# Temporal Anomaly Resolution
*Restoring Order to the Flow of Time*

> *"When time itself becomes wounded, when cause follows effect down impossible paths, when yesterday threatens to devour tomorrow—that is when we step forward. We are the surgeons of causality, the healers of broken moments, the guardians who ensure that the river of time continues to flow toward its proper destination."*
> — [[Master Temporal Engineer Chronos Fieldwright]], Director of Temporal Anomaly Resolution Services
