## Description
Birds are among the most alluring, elusive, and powerful creatures of the forest. We offer fowlersâ€™ snares for small and trainable birds such as the sparrow or the exotic mynah of Shou Lung, as well as traditional birds of prey such as the falcon and hawk. Both sizes of snare have open weave construction so that the bird will not feel enclosed until the door snaps shut behind it. Small-bird: 1 gp; Large-bird: 3 gp.
