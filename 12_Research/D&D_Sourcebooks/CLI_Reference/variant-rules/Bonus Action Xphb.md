# Bonus Action
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 362. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A Bonus Action is a special action that you can take on the same turn that you take an action. You can't take more than one Bonus Action on a turn, and you have a Bonus Action to take only if a rule explicitly says so.
