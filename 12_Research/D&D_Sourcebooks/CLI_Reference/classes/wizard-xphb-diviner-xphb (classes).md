As a Diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight. ### Divination Savant (Level 3) Choose two Wizard spells from the Divination school, each of which must be no higher than level 2, and add them to your spellbook for free. In addition, whenever you gain access to a new level of spell slots in this class, you can add one Wizard spell from the Divination school to your spellbook for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots. ### Portent (Level 3) Glimpses of the future begin to press on your awareness. Whenever you finish a [[long-rest-xphb]], roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any [[d20-test-xphb (variant-rules)]] made by you or a creature that you can see with one of these foretelling rolls. You must choose to do so before the roll, and you can replace a roll in this way only once per turn. Each foretelling roll can be used only once. When you finish a [[long-rest-xphb]], you lose any unused foretelling rolls. ### Expert Divination (Level 6) Casting Divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a Divination spell using a level 2+ spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the slot you expended and can't be higher than level 5. ### The Third Eye (Level 10) You can increase your powers of perception. As a [[Action Xphb]], choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you start a [[short-rest-xphb]] or [[long-rest-xphb]]. You can't use this feature again until you finish a [[short-rest-xphb]] or [[long-rest-xphb]]. #### Darkvision You gain [[senses#Darkvision|Darkvision]] with a range of 120 feet. #### Greater Comprehension You can read any language. #### See Invisibility You can cast [[see-invisibility-xphb (spells)]] without expending a spell slot. ### Greater Portent (Level 14) The visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture in your mind of what is to come. Roll three d20s for your Portent feature rather than two. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Wizard xphb diviner xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
