# Aquabyssos Submarines

Pressure-adaptive vessels built for the abyss. These ships integrate [[Complete Pressure Adaptation System]], [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]], [[Complete Reality Merger System]], [[Complete Faction Warfare System]], [[Memory Trading Economy System|Memory Trading Economy]], and [[Deep Mother]].

## Pressure-Adaptive Vessels (Examples)
- Coral Leviathan (Living coral hull; grows new bulkheads at Crush+)
- Parasite Choir Ship (Neural symbiosis; crew shares senses; Sanity risk)
- Memory Ghost Sub (Phase-through on consumed route memories; identity bleed)
- Crystal Resonator (Pressure-immune hull; vulnerable to harmonic shatter)
- Deep Blessed Nave (Navigates by madness; automatic prophecy pings)
- Tide Serpent (Flex spine hull; tunnels through current walls)
- Lantern Warden (Bio-luminescent veil; stealth in shadow blooms)
- Abyss Harvester (Pressure dredges; economic module)
- Anchor Frigate (Dual anchor mounts; escort duties)
- Echo Skiff (Scout; records memory echoes; fragile)
- Maelstrom Rider (Vortex engine; risky but fast)
- Shellback Cruiser (Segmented armor; localized repair)
- Wail Engine Boat (Sonic cannon; fear effects)
- Pearl Borer (Siege sub; bore torpedoes)
- Kelp Weave Cutter (Tangle immunity; boarding specialist)
- Rift Listener (Detects merger pre-shocks)
- Pressure Choir Barge (Crew chant reduces environmental DCs)
- Shadow Lantern Sloop (Shadow-sight optics; sanity saves on use)
- Leviathan Tamer (Harpoon arrays; creature control)
- Sovereign of Silt (Flagship; mobile base)

GM Note: Use [[New_Ship_Template|New Ship Template]] to add more. Aim for 50+ designs by expanding each class.

## Submarine Combat Systems
### Sonar Blind Combat
- Ping: Action; reveals vectors not details; enemies can detect
- Echo Lock: 2 consecutive pings grant targeting advantage
- Counter-Ping: Opposed Sensor check; reveal or spoof

### Pressure Weapons
- Implosion Torpedoes: On hit, target Structure save or segment ruptures
- Depth Charges: Detonate at set depth; damage × Zone Modifier
- Cavitation Mines: Create bubble voids; maneuver penalties

### Boarding & Biohazards
- Parasite Tubes: On latch, infection saves each round
- Coral Spread: Attaches to hull; corrodes armor unless burned

## Integration Hooks
- Adaptation: Pilots require AP per zone; ship may substitute with Stress (see [[Vehicle_Core_Rules|Vehicle Core Rules]])
- Sanity: Blind navigation, shadow optics, and Deep Mother whispers call for [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]] saves
- Reality: Anchor Frigates reduce merger effect tiers by 1 within 200 ft (requires anchors active)
- Memory: Ghost Subs consume charts (lose 1d4 Skill/Language memories on critical failure)
- Faction: Doctrines modify sonar, stealth, or parasite legality (see [[Fleet_Dynamics_Generator|Fleet Dynamics Generator]])

## Example Stat Block: Coral Leviathan (Large Cruiser)
- Hull 220 (Segments 5×44) • AC 16 coral+biofield • Speed 40 kn • Maneuver 2/round
- Crew 18/28/50 (Captain, Helms, Engineer×3, Sensor×2, Gunnery×3, Anchorite×2, Marines×6, Surgeon)
- Power POU 8 (Bio 5, Crystal 2, Memory 1)
- RSB +3 • Sanity Threshold 18 • Anchors 2 • Upgrade Slots Bio 3 / Crystal 2 / Pressure 2 / Memory 1 / Shrine 1
- Specials: Reef Regeneration (10 HP/round to one segment while stationary), Pressure Choir (-2 DC to pressure saves when crew chants)

## Tables

## Player-Facing Summary

Aquabyssos Submarines is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Aquabyssos Submarines as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Aquabyssos Submarines.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Aquabyssos Submarines to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at Aquabyssos Submarines to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to Aquabyssos Submarines active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
