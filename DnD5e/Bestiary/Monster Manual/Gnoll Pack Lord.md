## Special Traits
***Rampage.*** When the gnoll reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, the gnoll can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The gnoll makes two attacks, either with its glaive or its longbow, and uses its Incite Rampage if it can.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d4+3`) piercing damage.

***Glaive.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (`dice: 1d10+3`) slashing damage.

***Longbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d8+2`) piercing damage.

***Incite Rampage (Recharge 5-6).*** One creature the gnoll can see within 30 feet of it can use its reaction to make a melee attack if it can hear the gnoll and has the Rampage trait.

## Description
The alpha of a gnoll pack is the pack lord, ruling by might and cunning. A pack lord earns the best of a gnoll pack's spoils, food, valuable trinkets, and magic items. It ornaments its body with brutal piercings and grotesque trophies, dyeing its fur with demonic sigils, hoping Yeenoghu will make it invulnerable.
