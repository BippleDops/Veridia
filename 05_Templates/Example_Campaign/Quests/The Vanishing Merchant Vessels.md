## Quest Overview

Three merchant vessels have vanished without a trace over the past month, causing panic among Shadowhaven's trading community. The *Windwhisper*, *Golden Current*, and *Prosperity's Dream* were all well-established ships with experienced crews, making their simultaneous disappearance highly suspicious.

### The Stakes
- **Economic**: Each missing ship represents thousands of gold in lost cargo
- **Political**: Guild tensions are rising as accusations fly
- **Personal**: Several families have lost their primary income sources
- **Strategic**: The cargo included sensitive materials that could destabilize the region

## Quest Giver & Background

**Primary Quest Giver**: [[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/NPCs/Councillor Elara Brightwater]]

Elara approaches the party privately, revealing that the merchant guild is fracturing under the pressure. Some members blame sabotage by rival cities, others suspect internal betrayal, and a few whisper about supernatural causes. She needs trustworthy outsiders to investigate without triggering a guild war.

*"The official investigators have found nothing but empty water and conflicting testimonies. I need people who can ask the questions they can't - or won't."*

## The Missing Vessels

**Disappeared**: 28 days ago
**Route**: Shadowhaven to Port Celeste  
**Cargo**: Luxury textiles, exotic spices, enchanted jewelry

**Last Contact**: Routine morning signal, 2 days out of port

### The *Golden Current*  
**Disappeared**: 19 days ago
**Route**: Shadowhaven to Millbrook
**Cargo**: Magical components, rare metals, [[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/NPCs/Lady Seraphina Goldleaf]]'s mysterious locked chest
**Captain**: Elena Swiftwater (master navigator, never lost a ship)
**Crew**: 8 members, mixture of local and foreign sailors
**Last Contact**: Evening report mentioning "strange lights on the horizon"

### The *Prosperity's Dream*
**Disappeared**: 12 days ago  
**Route**: Shadowhaven to Ironhold Fortress
**Cargo**: Weapons, armor, military supplies, diplomatic correspondence
**Captain**: Marcus Ironwind (veteran, former naval officer)  
**Crew**: 15 members, many with military backgrounds
**Last Contact**: Distress signal using military codes - "Unknown vessels approaching"

## Investigation Tracks

### Track 1: Harbor Investigation
**Current Objective**: Interview witnesses and examine records

**Key Locations**:
- **Harbor Master's Office**: Shipping manifests, communication logs, departure records
- **The Salty Anchor Tavern**: Where sailors gossip and witnesses drink away their fears
- **Warehouse District**: Check for signs of the missing cargo being smuggled back into port

**Important NPCs**:
- **[[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/NPCs/Harbormaster Willem Tidecaller]]**: Nervous about his reputation, hiding some information
- **[[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/NPCs/Old Salt Pete]]**: Retired sailor who claims to have seen strange lights
- **[[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/NPCs/Marianne Crowley]]**: Tavern keeper who hears everything and forgets nothing

**Potential Clues**:
- Shipping logs show minor inconsistencies in departure times
- Multiple witnesses mention unusual weather patterns on the nights of disappearances  
- Several dock workers received unexpected bonuses recently

### Track 2: Political Intrigue
**Current Objective**: Investigate guild tensions and internal conflicts

**Key Locations**:
- **Guild Hall**: Official meetings and unofficial conversations
- **Noble Heights**: Where the real decisions are made
- **Council Chambers**: Public sessions and private deals

**Important NPCs**:
- **[[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/NPCs/Lady Seraphina Goldleaf]]**: Extremely concerned about her missing chest
- **[[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/NPCs/Master Thorne Blackforge]]**: Suspicious of foreign involvement
- **[[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/NPCs/The Benefactor]]** (Thieves Guild rep): Knows more than they're sharing

**Potential Clues**:
- Recent changes in trade agreements with rival cities
- Unusual private meetings between guild leaders
- Financial records showing suspicious transactions

### Track 3: Supernatural Investigation  
**Current Objective**: Explore reports of magical phenomena

**Key Locations**:
- **Ethereal Academy**: Magical detection and analysis
- **Starlight Observatory**: Astronomical observations and divination
- **Temple District**: Divine guidance and protection rituals

**Important NPCs**:
- **[[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/NPCs/Archmage Celestine Starweaver]]**: Can detect magical interference
- **[[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/NPCs/Oracle Moonwhisper]]**: Offers cryptic but accurate visions
- **[[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/NPCs/Brother Matthias|Brother Matthias]]**: Protects against dark magic

**Potential Clues**:
- Magical residue at departure points matches unknown school of magic
- Star charts show unusual celestial alignments during disappearances
- Divination spells are being mysteriously blocked

## Major Clues & Evidence

### Physical Evidence
- **Broken Compass**: Found floating near where the *Golden Current* vanished, needle spins wildly
- **Scorched Rope**: Recovered from the water, shows signs of magical fire
- **Strange Barnacles**: Growing on harbor pylons, species unknown to local marine biologists

### Witness Testimonies  
- **Dockworker Tom**: Saw unusual ships with black sails in the early morning hours
- **Fisherman's Widow Sarah**: Heard singing from empty waters three nights in a row
- **Young Timothy**: Claims his toy boat disappeared in the same area, then reappeared filled with seaweed

### Financial Trail
- Recent large withdrawals from guild accounts
- Payments to "shipping consultants" with no verifiable identities
- Insurance policies increased significantly just before the disappearances

## Complications & Obstacles

### Time Pressure
Every day that passes makes the trail colder and increases guild tensions. After 7 more days, the guilds will begin openly accusing each other, potentially leading to trade wars.

### False Leads
- **Red Herring**: Evidence pointing to Port Celeste merchants as saboteurs
- **Misdirection**: Supernatural phenomena designed to hide mundane criminality  
- **Political Smokescreen**: Guild infighting used to distract from external threats

### Dangerous Opposition
The perpetrators know they're being investigated and will attempt to:
- Intimidate witnesses and informants
- Plant false evidence to implicate the party
- Eliminate anyone who gets too close to the truth

## Resolution Paths

### Path 1: Criminal Conspiracy
**Revelation**: A group of corrupt officials is stealing cargo and selling ships to foreign buyers
**Climax**: Confrontation at a hidden cove where the next "disappearance" is planned
**Resolution**: Political scandal, arrests, recovery of some cargo and crews

### Path 2: Foreign Sabotage  
**Revelation**: A rival city is using magical means to capture ships and destabilize Shadowhaven's economy
**Climax**: Naval battle against disguised enemy vessels
**Resolution**: Diplomatic incident, possible war, guild unity against external threat

### Path 3: Supernatural Threat
**Revelation**: An ancient sea creature or cursed location is claiming ships as offerings
**Climax**: Magical ritual to banish the threat or navigate the supernatural hazard
**Resolution**: Mystical protection for trade routes, deeper magical mysteries revealed

### Path 4: Complex Truth (Recommended)
**Revelation**: All three elements are involved - corrupt officials working with foreign agents are using a genuine supernatural threat as cover
**Climax**: Multi-stage resolution requiring investigation, politics, and magical combat
**Resolution**: Complex consequences affecting multiple storylines

## Rewards & Consequences

### Successful Resolution
- **XP**: 2,000 divided among party members  
- **Gold**: 1,500 gp from grateful merchants
- **Items**: Harbor Master's Seal (grants free passage), Guild Favor Token (future assistance)
- **Reputation**: Hero status in Shadowhaven, connections throughout merchant community
- **Information**: Access to shipping networks, political secrets, magical knowledge

### Partial Success
- **Reduced Rewards**: Based on objectives completed
- **Ongoing Complications**: Unresolved elements continue to cause problems
- **Mixed Reputation**: Some factions pleased, others disappointed

### Failure
- **Guild War**: Economic conflict between trading factions
- **Trade Disruption**: Shadowhaven loses status as premier trade hub  
- **Personal Enemies**: Those responsible for the disappearances target the party
- **Future Obstacles**: Harder to gain trust and information in future investigations
