- Expedition survivors need help readjusting to life after their traumatic experience
- Ancient records found in the Skyforge reveal locations of other pre-collapse ruins --- *"Some expeditions discover new lands. Others discover that some places should remain lost. The question is: which kind of expedition were we?"* - Captain Zara Stormwind ## Player-Facing Summary Quest The Lost Expedition is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Quest The Lost Expedition as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Quest The Lost Expedition. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The First Prophecy of Depths ## Plot Hooks - An heirloom has gone missing and truth emerges
