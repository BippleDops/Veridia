## Description
My newest discovery, from the land across the sea known as Maztica! A native grain called mayz is ground between stones, and the coarse flour that results is baked on hot stone “griddles.” The flat bread can be eaten plain, sprinkled with cinnamon and a bit of sugar (if you are lucky enough to have such a thing!), wrapped around spiced, cooked meat, filled with spiced beans and baked in a cheese sauce . . . I have even heard of people who cut the tortilla into smaller pieces and fry them in deep fat or oil, rendering them crispy and crunchy! Shipped direct from the Temple of Helm at Ulatos; a percentage of the sales goes to the temple’s efforts to aid the natives with medical and educational efforts. Tortillas, 2 dozen: 25 gp, includes shipping.
