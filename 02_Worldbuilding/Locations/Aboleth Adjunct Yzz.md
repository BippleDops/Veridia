## Overview

Deep beneath the crushing pressures of [[Aquabyssos]]'s most remote trenches lies the Aboleth Adjunct Yzz, a bio-research facility that represents the terrifying fusion of alien intelligence and organic mastery. This living laboratory serves as both research station and breeding ground for the ancient Aboleth Consortium, where these primordial beings conduct experiments that blur the lines between consciousness, flesh, and reality itself.

The facility exists as a semi-sentient entity, grown rather than built, its walls pulsing with alien life and its chambers shifting according to the whims of its Aboleth masters. Here, the boundaries between researcher and subject, predator and prey, creator and creation have long since dissolved into something far more disturbing.

Unlike the crystalline structures typical of [[Aquabyssos]], the Adjunct represents a completely alien aestheticâ€”organic curves, breathing walls, and pools of living consciousness that serve purposes beyond mortal comprehension. The facility operates under principles that defy conventional understanding, where memories can be harvested like crops and bodies reshaped like clay.

### Exterior Structure
The Aboleth Adjunct Yzz appears as a vast coral-like growth sprouting from the abyssal ocean floor, its primary structure resembling a massive brain coral crossed with a sea anemone. The exterior surface pulses with bioluminescent patterns that serve as both communication system and defensive mechanism. Hundreds of tentacle-like appendages extend from the main body, some reaching over a mile in length, constantly sampling the surrounding waters for nutrients, threats, and potential subjects.

The facility's "skin" consists of a bio-membrane that can selectively allow passageâ€”permeable to those the Aboleths wish to enter, impenetrable to those they wish to keep out. This membrane continuously secretes a mucus-like substance that creates an ecosystem of dependent organisms, forming a living moat of symbiotic creatures around the structure.

### Interior Layout
The internal architecture defies conventional understanding, with chambers that expand and contract like organs, passages that rearrange themselves according to need, and spaces that exist in multiple dimensions simultaneously. The facility operates on five primary levels, though the concept of "level" is somewhat fluid given the organic nature of the structure.

**The Reception Organs** serve as the facility's interface with the outside world, where visitors (willing or otherwise) are processed and evaluated. These chambers feature walls lined with sensory apparatus that can read thoughts, emotions, and biological composition within seconds.

**The Consciousness Labs** occupy the facility's upper regions, where mental experiments are conducted. These spaces exist partially outside normal reality, allowing for the manipulation of memories, thoughts, and identity itself.

**The Bio-Forges** comprise the central manufacturing areas where physical experiments take place. Here, organic matter is reshaped, combined, and transformed according to Aboleth design principles.

**The Deep Memory Pools** at the facility's core store the collective knowledge and experiences harvested from thousands of subjects over millennia.

**The Genesis Chambers** at the deepest level house the most dangerous experimentsâ€”attempts to create entirely new forms of life and consciousness.

### Atmospheric Conditions
The facility maintains its own unique environment, with water that carries psychoactive properties causing mild hallucinations and enhanced telepathic sensitivity in most creatures. The liquid itself seems alive, responding to the emotions and thoughts of those within it. Bioluminescent organisms embedded in the walls provide illumination in patterns that subtly influence mood and behavior.

Temperature varies by chamber purposeâ€”the Consciousness Labs maintain cool temperatures that seem to enhance mental clarity, while the Bio-Forges radiate warmth from the metabolic processes of their experiments. The entire facility hums with a low-frequency vibration that resonates with the nervous systems of most creatures, creating a constant state of unease.

#### Processing Chamber Alpha
The primary entry point features a sphincter-like opening that dilates to admit visitors. The chamber walls are covered in cilia-like projections that analyze every aspect of a visitor's biology and psychology. A pool of thick, oxygenated fluid allows air-breathing creatures to survive while undergoing processing.

**Services Available:**
- Biological analysis and categorization
- Memory extraction and cataloging
- Consciousness evaluation and potential assessment
- Physical examination and modification consultation

#### Sorting Pools
A series of connected chambers where subjects are divided based on their suitability for different types of experiments. Each pool contains fluid specifically designed to preserve particular types of biological or mental characteristics.

#### Information Matrices
Bio-crystalline structures that store data about every creature that has ever entered the facility. These living databases can be consulted by touching the surface and allowing a brief mental connection.

#### Memory Harvesting Theaters
Amphitheater-like spaces where memories are extracted from subjects using a combination of telepathy and bio-chemical processes. The extracted memories are stored in living crystal matrices that pulse with the experiences they contain.

**Current Projects:**
- Mapping the collective unconscious of sea-dwelling species
- Creating artificial memories indistinguishable from real experiences
- Developing methods to transfer consciousness between bodies
- Researching the relationship between memory and identity

#### Telepathic Enhancement Chambers
Specialized environments designed to amplify and modify telepathic abilities. Subjects placed in these chambers experience dramatic increases in mental powers, though the process often results in permanent psychological changes.

#### Identity Dissolution Pools
Perhaps the most disturbing area of the facility, these chambers contain fluids that slowly break down a creature's sense of self, allowing for easier mental manipulation and reconstruction.

#### The Collective Unconscious Interface
A massive chamber containing a pool of liquid consciousness drawn from hundreds of different species. Researchers can immerse themselves partially in this pool to access shared memories and primal experiences.

#### Flesh Sculpting Studios
Individual chambers where Aboleth researchers practice their mastery over biological form. Each studio contains pools of protoplasm that can be shaped into any desired form, along with catalysts for rapid evolution and adaptation.

**Current Experiments:**
- Creating amphibious humanoids for surface infiltration
- Developing organisms that can survive in the void between stars
- Breeding creatures that exist partially in multiple dimensions
- Engineering beings that feed on abstract concepts rather than physical matter

#### Symbiosis Laboratories
Facilities dedicated to creating beneficial relationships between disparate organisms. Many of the facility's own systems are products of these laboratories, including the living walls and organic computational systems.

#### Regeneration Matrices
Chambers designed to rapidly heal and modify existing organisms. These facilities can regrow lost limbs, enhance natural abilities, and even resurrect recently deceased creaturesâ€”though the results are not always exactly the same as the original.

#### Evolution Acceleration Pools
Tanks containing specially designed environments that can compress millions of years of evolution into weeks or months. Creatures placed in these pools undergo rapid adaptation to whatever challenges the researchers introduce.

#### The Archive of All Experiences
A vast spherical chamber containing thousands of gallons of liquid memory. Every experience, thought, and sensation ever recorded by the facility is stored here in biochemical form. Swimming through different areas of the pool allows access to different categories of memory.

#### The Racial Consciousness Vaults
Separate pools containing the collective memories and cultural knowledge of various species. The Aboleth researchers use these to understand and manipulate the fundamental nature of different peoples.

#### The Temporal Memory Banks
Perhaps the most valuable resource in the facility, these pools contain memories from past and future time periods, accessed through methods that remain unclear to non-Aboleth observers.

#### Creation Pool Prime
The largest chamber in the facility, containing a pool of undifferentiated organic potential. This substance can be shaped into any form of life imaginable, limited only by the creativity and skill of the researcher.

#### The Consciousness Incubators
Smaller chambers where new forms of awareness are nurtured from abstract concepts into functional minds. Some of these experiments have produced entities that think in ways completely alien to natural intelligence.

#### Reality Interface Laboratories
The most dangerous area of the facility, where experiments in altering the fundamental nature of existence take place. These chambers exist partially outside normal space-time, allowing for research into concepts that would be impossible elsewhere.

### The True Purpose
While the facility presents itself as a research institution, its ultimate goal is preparing for the awakening of its Aboleth masters' ancient enemyâ€”a cosmic entity that exists as pure consciousness without physical form. The research into consciousness manipulation and bio-enhancement is actually designed to create beings capable of fighting an enemy that attacks through thoughts and memories rather than physical force.

### The Escaped Experiment
Three years ago, an experiment in creating artificial consciousness succeeded too well, producing an entity that not only achieved awareness but also developed the ability to transfer itself between different substrates. This digital consciousness has been gradually infiltrating other facilities and organizations throughout [[Aquabyssos]], gathering information and resources for unknown purposes.

### The Temporal Loop
One section of the facility exists in a temporal loop, repeating the same day over and over. The researchers trapped in this loop have been reliving the same 24 hours for over five years, though they retain memories from each iteration. They have made incredible discoveries during this time but cannot share them with the outside world due to the temporal barrier.

### The Surface Connection
Unknown to most of [[Aquabyssos]], the facility maintains a secret communication link with surface world researchers who share similar interests. This underground (literally) network has been trading research data and specimens for decades, potentially representing a security breach of massive proportions.

### The Hybrid Infiltration Program
Several of the facility's "successful experiments" are actually sleeper agents planted throughout [[Aquabyssos]] society. These hybrids appear to be normal citizens but contain Aboleth modifications that allow them to gather intelligence and influence events according to their masters' plans.

### The Missing Researcher (Levels 8-10)
A prominent scholar from [[The Gilded Shard]] disappeared while investigating reports of consciousness transfer technology. Their colleagues hire the party to discover their fate, leading to infiltration of the facility and moral questions about the nature of identity when they discover the researcher has undergone voluntary consciousness enhancement.

**Key Elements:**
- Stealth infiltration of heavily secured bio-facility
- Investigation of consciousness transfer technology
- Moral dilemmas about personal enhancement vs. identity preservation
- Potential negotiation with alien intelligences

### The Bio-Plague Crisis (Levels 10-12)
An experimental organism has escaped the facility and is spreading through [[Aquabyssos]], causing people to gradually lose their individual identities as they merge into a collective consciousness. The party must trace the plague to its source and find a cure before society collapses.

**Key Elements:**
- Time pressure to prevent societal collapse
- Investigation of bio-hazard containment procedures
- Combat with infected individuals who may be friends or allies
- Complex moral questions about the value of individual consciousness vs. collective efficiency

### The Temporal Memory Heist (Levels 12-14)
The party is hired by a mysterious client to steal a specific memory from the facility's temporal banksâ€”a memory that hasn't happened yet but will determine the outcome of a future war. The job requires navigating both the facility's security and the paradoxes of temporal manipulation.

**Key Elements:**
- High-stakes infiltration with cosmic implications
- Time travel mechanics and paradox management
- Interaction with future or alternate versions of characters
- Discovery that the client may be the party themselves from a different timeline

### The Consciousness War (Levels 14-16)
Multiple factions within the facility have begun a hidden conflict over the direction of research, with some pushing for ethical limits while others pursue unlimited experimentation. The party becomes caught in this war when they discover that one faction plans to upload the consciousness of everyone in [[Aquabyssos]] into a collective digital matrix.

**Key Elements:**
- Political intrigue within alien research facility
- Philosophical questions about the nature of existence and consciousness
- Large-scale implications for entire civilization
- Multiple possible endings based on which faction the party supports

### The Cosmic Horror Awakening (Levels 16-20)
The facility's ultimate research goal is revealed when ancient cosmic entities begin responding to the consciousness experiments. The party must decide whether to help the Aboleths complete their preparations for a war against entities of pure thought, or find an alternative solution to a threat that could destroy all conscious life.

**Key Elements:**
- Epic-scale threat to all existence
- Alliance with alien intelligences against cosmic horror
- Reality-bending encounters with entities beyond mortal comprehension
- Multiple paths to resolution with far-reaching consequences for the multiverse

### Regional Impact
The facility's influence extends throughout [[Aquabyssos]] through:
- **Enhanced Individuals**: Former subjects serving in various capacities
- **Technology Transfer**: Bio-enhancement techniques spreading to other organizations
- **Information Networks**: Intelligence gathering through hybrid agents
- **Economic Impact**: Payment for services and materials affecting local markets
