*The Corporate Predator, Mistress of Hostile Takeovers*

## Overview
Lady Jade Clawgrip serves as the "Scale of Acquisition" on the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Silverscale Consortium]]'s Board of Scales, specializing in hostile takeovers, corporate warfare, and the complete destruction of business competitors.
