--- > [!figure] View # Captain Marcus *"The sea respects discipline and despises weakness. Under my command, we embody both the honor and the strength that keep Aquabyssos safe from the depths' darkest threats."* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview Captain Marcus Stormheart commands the elite naval vessel "Deepwatch" and serves as one of Aquabyssos's most experienced deep-sea patrol commanders. With over twenty years of military service, he has earned a reputation for tactical brilliance, unwavering loyalty to the city, and an almost supernatural ability to navigate the treacherous currents of both ocean and politics. Marcus specializes in long-range reconnaissance and threat assessment, leading expeditions into the deepest and most dangerous areas of the ocean to monitor for potential threats to the city. His ship and crew are often the first line of defense against abyssal creatures, hostile forces from other underwater realms, and mysterious phenomena from the deep trenches. As political tensions rise within Aquabyssos, Marcus finds himself in the difficult position of maintaining military neutrality while ensuring the city's external defenses remain strong regardless of internal conflicts. ## Appearance Marcus is a weathered human in his mid-forties, with salt-and-pepper hair kept in a military cut and piercing gray eyes that seem to constantly scan for threats. His face bears the deep tan of someone who has spent years under magical illumination, and numerous small scars tell the story of encounters with deep-sea predators and hostile forces. He wears a modified naval uniform designed for underwater operations, complete with rank insignia and a captain's coat that has been enchanted for protection against pressure and cold. His most distinctive feature is an ornate trident badge that marks him as a certified deep-sea commander, earned through trials that few survive. ## Statistics

**Attack.** Marcus makes one cutlass attack.
**Tactical Command (Costs 2 Actions).** Marcus grants an ally advantage on their next action and allows them to move up to their speed without provoking opportunity attacks. ## Background Marcus began his naval career as a common sailor but quickly distinguished himself through courage, intelligence, and natural leadership ability. He earned his commission during the Deep Trench War, where his innovative tactics helped repel an invasion of aberrant creatures from the deepest ocean zones. Over the years, he has commanded multiple vessels and trained dozens of officers who now serve throughout Aquabyssos's naval forces. His expertise in deep-sea operations has made him the go-to commander for dangerous missions requiring both military skill and exploratory courage. Marcus has never married, dedicating himself entirely to his military service and the protection of Aquabyssos. His crew considers him family, and he treats them with the loyalty and care of a protective father figure. ## Current Activities With political tensions rising within the city, Marcus has increased his patrols of the outer territories, concerned that internal discord might make Aquabyssos vulnerable to external threats. He's been investigating reports of unusual activity in the deep trenches and evidence of potential hostile surveillance of the city. He's also been quietly preparing contingency plans for various scenarios, including the possibility that political conflicts might disrupt normal defensive operations or that external enemies might try to exploit the city's internal divisions. ## Quest Hooks

1. Marcus approaches the party with evidence of external threats to the city, needing discrete investigators who can operate outside official channels.
2. The party requires naval transport for a dangerous mission, leading them to negotiate with Marcus for the use of his ship and crew.
3. Strange signals from the deep ocean suggest an imminent threat, and Marcus needs the party's help to investigate without alarming the civilian population. ## DM Notes

Captain Marcus serves as a reliable military contact and source of information about external threats to Aquabyssos. His neutral political stance makes him useful to any party regardless of their factional allegiances, while his military resources can provide transportation and support for maritime adventures. Use him to represent the professional military's concerns about how political conflicts might affect the city's defenses. ## Player-Facing Summary Captain Marcus is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
