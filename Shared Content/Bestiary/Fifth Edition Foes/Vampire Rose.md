## Description
Vampire roses look like normal white rose bushes and are often mistaken for such. The typical vampire rose bush stands about 3 feet tall. The plant remains motionless until its prey moves within range, when it “strikes” with a thorny stalk. This attack is almost imperceptible and easily mistaken for simply becoming snagged by the thorny vines of a normal rose bush. It’s only on the vampire rose’s next turn, when the vine tightens its grip and thorns really dig into the victim’s flesh and begin siphoning out blood, that the true nature of the plant becomes apparent.

When fully sated with blood, a vampire rose’s petals flush red.

Vampire roses spreading out of control have been known to render entire valleys and stretches of forest impassable. Because they can uproot themselves and move to find fresh sources of food, it’s possible for fully grown vampire roses to appear literally overnight in areas that were clear the day before, closing roads or even encircling a farm or a hamlet and cutting it off from its neighbors.
