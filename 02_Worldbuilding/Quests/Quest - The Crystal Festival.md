# Quest - The Crystal Festival
*The Convergence of Shards, The Queen's Gambit, The Transformation Celebration*

## Quest Overview
The annual Crystal Festival celebrates the discovery of Aether Crystals and their integration into [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] society. This year's 500th anniversary festival promises to be spectacularâ€”but shadows gather beneath the celebration. [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]] secretly plans to use the festival to gather all Seven Shards, while multiple factions plot to seize power during the festivities. The party must navigate political intrigue, prevent catastrophe, and decide the fate of the Crystal Crown.
