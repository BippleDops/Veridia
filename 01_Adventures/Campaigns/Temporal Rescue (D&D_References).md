An emergency mission where someone important displaceded in time by magical accident or deliberate action. Players must navigate temporal anomalies, paradoxes, and time-based hazards to rescue the victim before temporal forces strand them permanently. ## The Victim

**Princess Coral Tidesinger**: Royal heir trapped 200 years in the past
**Displacement Cause**: Experimental time magic gone wrong during ceremony
**Time Period**: Era before Aquabyssos's technological advancement
**Current Status**: Alive but creating dangerous temporal paradoxes
**Rescue Window**: 72 hours before temporal anchoring becomes permanent ## Time Magic Mechanics

**Temporal Anchoring**: People become fixed in time period after 3 days
**Paradox Stress**: Changes to past create reality distortions

**Time Navigation**: Requires precise calculations and magical coordination
**Emergency Return**: Emergency evacuation possible but risky ## Mission Parameters

**Primary Objective**: Locate and extract Princess Coral safely
**Secondary Objective**: Minimize changes to historical timeline
**Tertiary Objective**: Gather intelligence about temporal anomaly source
**Time Limit**: 72 hours in present equals 3 months in past
**Equipment**: Temporal stabilizers, communication devices, period-appropriate gear ## Temporal Hazards

**Time Storms**: Chaotic areas where past and present collide
**Paradox Zones**: Regions where timeline changes create dangerous instability
**Temporal Echoes**: Ghost-like repetitions of events from different time periods
**Chronometer Drain**: Magic that ages objects and people rapidly

**Temporal Compass**: Magical device pointing toward time displacement origin
**Historical Records**: Using knowledge of past events to predict locations
**Magical Signatures**: Tracking Princess Coral's unique magical aura
**Time Anchors**: Fixed points in timeline that provide stable reference
**Local Contacts**: Period-appropriate allies who can provide assistance ## Historical Context

**Political Situation**: Ancient kingdom at war with neighboring territories
**Social Structure**: More rigid class system than modern Aquabyssos
**Technology Level**: Pre-industrial with basic magical infrastructure
**Key Figures**: Historical persons who must not be significantly affected
**Major Events**: Important occurrences that must proceed as recorded ## Paradox Management

**Butterfly Effect**: Small changes potentially altering entire timeline
**Causal Loops**: Events that cause themselves through time travel
**Temporal Immunity**: Protection spells preventing paradox creation
**History Repair**: Methods for correcting accidental timeline changes
**Documentation**: Recording changes to assess future impact ## Extraction Methods

**Direct Retrieval**: Immediate temporal portal back to present
**Gradual Preparation**: Slowly preparing Princess for extraction
**Staged Evacuation**: Multiple trips to minimize temporal stress
**Emergency Abort**: Rapid escape if mission becomes impossible
**Temporal Camouflage**: Hiding extraction within historical events ## Opposition Forces

**Temporal Guardians**: Entities protecting timeline integrity
**Historical Enemies**: Past era threats that complicate mission
**Paradox Manifestations**: Physical representations of timeline damage
**Enemy Time Travelers**: Opponents seeking to exploit temporal crisis
**Chronological Immune System**: Universe's response to timeline damage ## Equipment and Preparation

**Period Costumes**: Clothing appropriate to historical era
**Language Preparation**: Knowledge of archaic speech patterns

**Personal Relationships**: Modern consequences of past era interactions
**Temporal Expertise**: Team becomes known for time-related problem solving ## Adventure Hooks

1. Temporal accident occurs during important ceremony
2. Enemy deliberately displaces important person in time
3. Characters witness temporal anomaly requiring investigation
4. Time traveler from future warns of impending temporal crisis ## Research Requirements

**Historical Study**: Learning about target time period
**Temporal Theory**: Understanding time magic principles
**Magical Preparation**: Acquiring protection spells and equipment
**Intelligence Gathering**: Information about displacement circumstances
**Contingency Planning**: Preparing for various failure scenarios ## DM Notes
