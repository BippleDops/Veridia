# Tasirin's Haunted Sleep (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour


## Effects
One creature you touch must make a Wisdom saving throw or fall into a deep sleep. The creature cannot be awoken from this sleep except by using the spells *dispel magic, lesser restoration*, or *remove curse.* Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect. If the creature is already asleep, it makes the saving throw at disadvantage.

While the target is asleep, you may pro-ject images and emotions into the its mind. The subject will then have dreams or nightmares based on those images. The exact results are up to the DM, depending on the content of the sent images.

You may also place a *suggestion* into the target’s mind. The creature may make a Wisdom saving throw to resist. It will then follow the suggestion when it awakens.
