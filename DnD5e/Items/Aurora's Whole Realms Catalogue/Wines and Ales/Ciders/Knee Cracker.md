## Description
This cider, derived from local pressings of windfall apples, is available in bulk. The nature of local presses leads to a heavy sediment, and the cider should be allowed to settle for at least three days after it arrives at its final destination. Stronger than an ale but weaker than a good wine, this is a robust cloudy drink. Hand keg, 1 sp; cask, 4 sp; barrel, 1 gp; butt, 35 sp; tun, 8 gp.
