Old Valdris exists in a massive air bubble, perfectly preserved as it was in the moments before [[The Great Drowning. The city's 50,000 inhabitants are frozen in time, caught mid-action in their daily lives, turned to living crystal. The bubble is maintained by the collective dying wish of the population, and walking through the streets means witnessing the last moments of a civilization. Time moves strangely here - visitors age rapidly in some areas while becoming frozen in others. ### The Merchant Quarter

Traders frozen mid-transaction, coins hanging in the air between hands. [The Crystal Merchant]] still moves, somehow immune to the freezing, trading in temporal fragments. ### The Noble Heights

Wealthy district where a grand ball was in progress. Dancers frozen mid-step, musicians with instruments raised. [[Lady Vivienne the Unfrozen still dances alone among the statues. ### The Common Wells

Working class area where people were drawing the last water before the flood. The water in the wells shows visions of what could have been. ### The Temple District

Priests frozen in prayer, some reaching toward the ceiling as if seeing the water coming. [The Last Priest]] kneels at the altar, tears of crystal on his face. ### The Scholar's Row

Library and academy where students and teachers are frozen reading books about avoiding catastrophe. The books still turn their own pages. ### The Fast Lanes

Streets where time moves at 100x speed - crossing ages visitors by years. ### The Slow Gardens

Parks where time nearly stops - flowers frozen mid-bloom for centuries. ### The Loop Market

Shopping area caught in a 5-minute time loop, replaying the same moments forever. ### The Backward Bridge

Bridge where time reverses - injuries heal but memories are erased. ## The Crystallized Citizens

The frozen inhabitants are aware but cannot move or speak. Their eyes follow visitors, and those who touch them experience the person's last thoughts and emotions. Some visitors report hearing whispers when alone. ### King Marcus the Final

Frozen on his throne, crown halfway fallen from his head, reaching toward a map showing escape routes that were never used. ### The Crying Child

A young girl frozen mid-sob in the market square. Those who touch her are overwhelmed with prophetic visions of the drowning. ### The Warning Runner

A messenger frozen mid-sprint, mouth open in a shout of warning that never finished. His message scroll floats just beyond his fingertips. ## Secrets

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Old Valdris as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Old Valdris. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Hidden Prophecy of Depths ## Plot Hooks - Strange sightings suggest ancient magic
