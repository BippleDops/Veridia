*The Voice That Knows All Secrets, The Masked Songstress, Keeper of Whispered Truths*

## Overview
The Siren is [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s most notorious information broker, operating through a network of bardic colleges, taverns, and noble courts. No one knows their true identity—they appear differently to each person, always behind an ornate crystal mask that shifts colors with their mood. Their voice can shatter crystal or mend hearts, and they claim to know every secret worth knowing in both Aethermoor and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]].
