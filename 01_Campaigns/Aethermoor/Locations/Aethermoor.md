# Aethermoor
*The Shattered Crown Continent*

## Overview
Aethermoor is a continent forever changed by the Great Crystallization, an event 500 years ago when massive spires of crystallized magic erupted from the earth. These Aether Crystals grant incredible magical power but come with a terrible price - prolonged exposure causes crystalline corruption, slowly transforming living beings into crystal themselves.
