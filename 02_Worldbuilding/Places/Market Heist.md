# Market Heist

*"The greatest theft is the one no one notices until it's too late."*

## Overview
A complex criminal operation targeting the Grand Market's central vault during the Tide Festival when security is distracted and crowds provide cover. The heist requires careful planning, specialized skills, and perfect timing to succeed.

## The Target
**Market Vault**: Central repository containing daily receipts from all vendors
**Contents**: 50,000+ gold in coins and trade goods
**Security**: Magical wards, mechanical locks, guard rotation
**Access**: Three separate entry points, all heavily protected
**Timing**: Must occur during 4-hour festival window

## Heist Structure
**Phase 1**: Intelligence gathering and planning (1 week)
**Phase 2**: Equipment procurement and team assembly (3 days)
**Phase 3**: Infiltration during festival distraction (4 hours)
**Phase 4**: Vault penetration and theft execution (2 hours)
**Phase 5**: Escape and evidence cleanup (1 hour)

## Required Skills
**Lockpicking**: Multiple complex mechanical locks
**Magical Dispelling**: Neutralizing ward systems
**Stealth**: Moving undetected through secured areas
**Social Engineering**: Manipulating guards and officials
**Acrobatics**: Navigating tight spaces and vertical approaches

## Team Roles
**The Mastermind**: Plans operation and coordinates team
**Lock Specialist**: Defeats mechanical security systems
**Ward Breaker**: Handles magical protections
**Inside Contact**: Provides access and information
**Lookout**: Monitors security and warns of problems
**Muscle**: Handles unexpected complications

## Security Obstacles
**Guard Patrols**: Rotating shifts with overlapping coverage
**Magical Alarms**: Detection spells triggered by intrusion
**Physical Barriers**: Reinforced doors, walls, and windows
**Trap Systems**: Hidden devices protecting critical areas
**Emergency Protocols**: Rapid response to security breaches

## Planning Requirements
**Vault Layout**: Detailed maps and architectural information
**Security Schedules**: Guard rotations and duty assignments
**Festival Timeline**: Crowd patterns and distraction opportunities
**Escape Routes**: Multiple exit strategies for different scenarios
**Equipment Lists**: Specialized tools and magical items needed

## Key NPCs
**Marcus Goldkeeper**: Vault supervisor with access codes
**Guard Captain Marina**: Security chief who must be avoided
**Festival Coordinator**: Official whose activities create distractions
**Inside Contact "Silk"**: Market employee providing intelligence
**Fence "Goldtooth"**: Criminal who handles stolen goods disposal

## Equipment Needed
**Lockpicks**: Masterwork tools for complex mechanisms
**Ward Stones**: Magical items for neutralizing protective spells
**Silence Spells**: Preventing noise during infiltration
**Climbing Gear**: Ropes, grapples, and securing devices
**Communication**: Whisper magic or hand signals
**Disguises**: Costumes allowing movement during festival

## Infiltration Methods
**Tunnel Approach**: Underground access through maintenance passages
**Rooftop Entry**: Vertical approach from building above vault
**Festival Disguise**: Hiding in plain sight during celebrations
**Guard Impersonation**: Replacing or duplicating security personnel
**Magical Teleportation**: Direct transport past physical barriers

## Complications
- Unexpected security changes or additional guards
- Equipment failure at critical moments
- Discovery by patrol or civilian witnesses
- Rival criminal group attempting same heist
- Inside contact compromised or unreliable

## Success Conditions
**Primary**: Steal maximum amount without triggering alarms
**Secondary**: No casualties or violence during operation
**Tertiary**: Leave no evidence identifying team members
**Optimal**: Operation appears to be inside job or accident

## Failure Consequences
**Capture**: Imprisonment, interrogation, criminal prosecution
**Exposure**: Reputation damage, future opportunities lost
**Violence**: Escalation causing injuries or deaths
**Partial Success**: Some loot recovered but operation compromised
**Total Failure**: No profit and maximum heat from authorities

## Moral Considerations
- Impact on honest merchants who lose income
- Potential violence against innocent security guards
- Using festival celebration as cover for crime
- Corruption of inside contacts and officials
- Long-term damage to market economy and trust

## Alternative Approaches
**Legitimate Acquisition**: Legal methods of obtaining similar wealth
**Partial Heist**: Taking smaller amount with lower risk
**Information Theft**: Stealing valuable secrets instead of money
**Extortion**: Using gathered intelligence for blackmail
**Sabotage**: Disrupting competitors rather than direct theft

## Rewards
- 3,000-6,000 XP based on execution quality
- 50,000+ gold in stolen goods (if successful)
 - Criminal reputation and underworld connections
- Advanced equipment acquired during preparation
- Information about other potential targets

## Law Enforcement Response
**Investigation**: Detailed inquiry into security breach
**Manhunt**: Active search for suspects and evidence
**Informants**: Rewards offered for information
**Security Upgrades**: Improved protection against future attempts
**Political Pressure**: Government crackdown on organized crime

## Adventure Hooks
1. Characters recruited for their specialized skills
2. Party discovers heist plan and must decide response
3. Characters hired to prevent or investigate the heist
4. Rival group attempts to sabotage player character heist

## Long-term Consequences
Successful heist establishes criminal reputation but increases law enforcement attention. Failure may close off criminal opportunities but could lead to legitimate alternatives.

## DM Notes
This heist emphasizes planning and teamwork over combat. Reward creative problem-solving and thorough preparation. Consider moral implications and how success or failure affects future campaign opportunities.
