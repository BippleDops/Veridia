--- # Vehicle Customization & Progression Upgrade trees, crew mechanics, and living evolution paths. Ties into [[Complete Faction Warfare System doctrines, [Memory Trading Economy System|Memory Trading Economy]] markets, and [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Modular Upgrade Systems

- Biological Grafting: Parasite symbionts, coral armor, regenerative sacs
- Crystal Harmonics: Resoce tuning, prism shields, focus lenses
- Pressure Mods: Adaptive ballast, crush frames, cavitation cloaks
- Memory Cores: Route libraries, echo recorders, identity locks
- Anchor Mounts: Personal/portable anchors, seal generators
- Deep Shrines: Sanity buffers, prophecy interfaces, curse risks Mechanic: Each slot holds 1 module; installing adds Power draw and Maintece burden. Over-capacity adds Stress per hour. ## Example Upgrade Tree: Coral Leviathan

Tier 1: Coral Plating • Regenerative Pores • Reef Sensors

Tier 2: Choir Wells • Parasite Countermeasures • Symbiotic Brig

Tier 3: Cathedral Spine • Living Drydock • Oracle Polyps Use [New_Ship_Template|New Ship Template]] to attach upgrade notes per hull. ## Player-Facing Summary Vehicle Customization Progression is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Vehicle Customization Progression as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Vehicle Customization Progression. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Second Prophecy of Stars ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[Crafting Transcendence
