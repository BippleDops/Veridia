--- > [!figure] Portrait # Lord Aurelius Goldwave

*The Golden Tongue of Port Meridian* > *"My ancestors made a choice that damned us all. I intend to make a choice that redeems us. The price of redemption, you ask? Everything I have built, everything I am, everything I could become. But some debts can only be paid in full."* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Lord Aurelius Goldwave is the wealthiest and most influential merchant-noble in [[Port Meridian|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian, descended from Aurelius the Goldweaver - one of the Seven Betrayers who shattered [The Crown of Stars]] 500 years ago. Though he presents himself as a successful trader and benevolent patron of the arts, he secretly leads [[The Order of the Shattered Crown, dedicated to gathering the [The Seven Shards|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]] to undo his ancestor's great sin. His vast fortune, built through crystal trade and careful political manipulation, serves a single purpose: atonement for the betrayal that doomed Aethermoor to centuries of crystal corruption. ## Personality

Lord Goldwave embodies the complexity of nobility burdened by ancestral guilt:
- **Charming Manipulator**: Uses wit, wealth, and magical persuasion to achieve his goals

- **Intellectually Ruthless**: Will sacrifice individuals for the greater good without hesitation
- **Secretly Desperate**: Beneath the polished exterior lies a man racing against time and corruption ### Public Persona vs. Private Truth

**Public**: Successful merchant-lord, patron of arts and education, advocate for responsible crystal use
**Private**: Obsessed revolutionary planning to fundamentally reshape Aethermoor's power structure ## Speaking Patterns

Lord Goldwave's speech reflects his bardic training and aristocratic upbringing:
- *"The past writes the present, but we hold the pen for the future's final chapter."*
- *"Wealth without purpose is merely decorated greed. I prefer my gold to serve grander designs."*
- *"My dear friend, every betrayal begins with the best of intentions. I should know - my family wrote the manual."*
- *"The Seven made their choice in darkness. I make mine in the light, with full knowledge of the cost."* ### Lord Aurelius Goldwave

The Goldwave family descended from Aurelius the Goldweaver, the most powerful enchanter among [[The Seven Betrayers. His ancestor's specialty was ficial manipulation and mass persuasion - abilities he used to convince the other six to betray [The Crimson Sage|Aetheron]]. When the Crown shattered, the Goldweaver was consumed by the Golden Shard's power, leaving behind only his techniques and a massive fortune built on betrayal. ### The Burden of Knowledge

Unlike most descendants of the Betrayers, the Goldwave family maintained detailed records of their ancestor's actions. Aurelius learned the full truth at age 16 when he inherited the family's secret archives. The revelation shattered his worldview and set him on his current path of redemption. ### Building an Empire

Over thirty years, Aurelius transformed the family's inherited wealth into the largest trading empire in [[Port Meridian|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian. He:
- Monopolized the safe transport of crystal goods
- Established the Goldwave Academy for Crystal Studies
- Created a network of agents throughout Aethermoor
- Secretly founded and funded [The Order of the Shattered Crown]] ### The Order of the Shattered Crown

This secretive organization, led by Aurelius, seeks to:
- Locate and gather all [[The Seven Shards|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards
- Undo the betrayal by reforging the Crown of Stars
- Restore [The Crimson Sage|Aetheron]] to proper godhood
- End crystal corruption permanently The Order operates through legitimate businesses, scholarly research, and careful political influence rather than force or theft. ### The Goldwave Trading Empire

Lord Goldwave's business interests include:
- **Crystal Purification Services**: Safe handling and transportation of corrupted crystals
- **The Goldwave Shipping Consortium**: Largest merchant fleet on the Azure Coast
- **Crystal Insurance Guild**: Protects merchants against corruption losses
- **Goldwave Academy**: Premier institution for crystal research and safety training
- **The Meridian Exchange**: Port Meridian's primary crystal trading post #### **[[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde|02 Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde - The Corrupted Crown** **Historical Development**:

- **The Coronation Investment (12 years ago)**: Aurelius saw Seraphina's coronation as an opportunity for redemption through service, presenting the legendary Goldweaver Chandelier (a family heirloom worth 50,000 gold) as a coronation gift to signal his commitment to her reign
- **The Early Partnership (Years 1-3)**: Became Seraphina's primary ficial backer during her vulnerable early reign, providing economic stability in exchange for favorable trade policies and the hope of earning royal favor for his eventual redemption quest
- **The Corruption Discovery (5 years ago)**: Aurelius's merchant networks reported strange purchases by royal agents—expensive medical supplies, rare magical components, and secrecy surrounding the Queen's health. His investigation revealed her crystal corruption, creating both opportunity and moral crisis
- **The Dangerous Alliance (Current)**: Now trapped in a relationship where both need each other but neither fully trusts the other **Past Conflicts & Resolutions**:
- **The Trade Route Confrontation (7 years ago)**: Aurelius pushed for crystal trade expansion through dangerous territories to speed his wealth accumulation. Seraphina refused due to corruption risks. Their three-month standoff ended when Aurelius agreed to fund safety measures, recognizing that his redemption meant nothing if he caused more corruption
- **The Merchant Prince Scandal (4 years ago)**: When other Merchant Princes accused Aurelius of receiving unfair royal favor, Seraphina publicly criticized him to maintain political balance. Aurelius felt betrayed and humiliated, leading to their worst crisis. Resolution came through a private dinner where Seraphina revealed some of her burdens, helping him understand the political pressures she faced
- **The Shard Competition Crisis (2 years ago)**: Both discovered they were seeking the Seven Shards for different reasons. Initial sense of betrayal gave way to recognition that their goals—her cure and his redemption—might align if they worked together **Shared History**:
- **The Port Meridian Victory**: During the great pirate siege, Aurelius funded mercenary companies while Seraphina coordinated Crown forces, successfully repelling Captain Thaddeus Blackwater's fleet in a joint operation that saved thousands of lives
- **The Royal Academy Foundation**: Together founded the Royal Academy for Crystal Studies, combining his guilt-driven funding with her royal authority to create lasting institutions for crystal safety research
- **The Assassination Survival**: Both survived poisoning attempts at the same state dinner (3 years ago), creating a bond of shared vulnerability and mutual protection **Political Debts & Obligations**:
- **Aurelius owes Seraphina**: Royal protection from business rivals who have tried to destroy him three times through false accusations of treason
- **Seraphina owes Aurelius**: Over 800,000 gold pieces in loans for her secret corruption research, disguised as "palace renovation costs" in official records
- **The Marriage Consideration**: Both briefly considered a marriage alliance between Aurelius and Seraphina's hidden daughter Aria, though both have private reservations about mixing their complicated relationship with family bonds **Secret Agreements**:
- **The Corruption Compact**: Aurelius provides ficial and logistical support for Seraphina's corruption treatment in exchange for her knowledge of Shard locations and royal authority to access restricted areas
- **The Mutual Destruction Pact**: Both possess information that could destroy the other—Aurelius knows about her corruption, she knows about his Order of the Shattered Crown leadership and time magic research
- **The Succession Contingency**: If Seraphina's corruption becomes public, Aurelius will use his wealth and influence to support her daughter Aria's claim to the throne
- **The Final Bargain**: If Aurelius succeeds in his temporal redemption plan, he will ensure Seraphina is cured in the new timeline; if she finds a cure first, she will help him complete his redemption quest #### **[High Inquisitor Maltheos|02 Worldbuilding/People/High Inquisitor Maltheos]] - The Righteous Opposition** **Historical Development**:

- **Early Respect**: Initially admired Maltheos's anti-corruption stance, seeing him as someone fighting the same evil that drove his redemption quest
- **Growing Tension**: As Maltheos's methods became more extreme, Aurelius began to see him as a threat to innocent people caught in corruption circumstances
- **Current Opposition**: Now views Maltheos as a dangerous extremist whose righteous goals don't justify his harsh methods **Ideological Conflict**:
- **Shared Goal, Different Methods**: Both want to end crystal corruption, but Maltheos seeks to destroy while Aurelius seeks to redeem
- **The Queen Problem**: Maltheos would execute Seraphina for corruption; Aurelius seeks to cure her
- **Political Maneuvering**: Aurelius uses his wealth and influence to quietly counter Maltheos's more extreme initiatives #### **[[The Crimson Sage|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]] - The Target of Redemption** **The Ultimate Relationship**:

- **Ancestral Debt**: The Crimson Sage (Aetheron) is the primary victim of Aurelius's ancestor's betrayal, making their relationship the cornerstone of his entire life's work
- **Indirect Contact**: Has never met the Sage directly but knows he occasionally advises Queen Seraphina
- **Redemption Focus**: Every major decision in Aurelius's life is measured against how it advances his goal of making amends to Aetheron
- **The Final Meeting**: Believes his redemption quest will ultimately require a face-to-face encounter with the diminished god ## Secrets & Hidden Agendas > [!warning] DM Only - The True Plan

> Lord Goldwave doesn't just want to gather the Seven Shards - he plans to use them to travel back in time and prevent the original betrayal. He's discovered that the Golden Shard, currently within [[Aria Lumengarde, can theoretically power such a spell. His real goal is to sacrifice himself to undo the timeline where his ancestor betrayed Aetheron, accepting that this would erase his own existence. ### Hidden Resources:

1. **The Temporal Calculations**: Mathematical formulas for time magic using Shard energy
2. **The Betrayer's Vault**: Hidden repository containing artifacts from all Seven Betrayers
3. **The Redemption Ritual**: A spell designed to channel all seven Shards' power into time manipulation
4. **The Memory Archive**: Preserved consciousness fragments from his ancestor and the other Betrayers ### The Goldwave Guilt Complex

Aurelius suffers from what he calls "inherited sin" - the belief that his bloodline carries the cosmic debt of his ancestor's betrayal. This drives him toward increasingly desperate measures, including:
- Considering mass memory modification to ease corruption suffering
- Planning to manipulate [Aria Lumengarde]] to access the Golden Shard
- Preparing to betray current allies if necessary for the greater good
- Accepting that his redemption plan will likely destroy him and everyone he cares about ### Early Campaign (Levels 1-5):

4. **Historical Research**: He commissions the party to explore ruins related to the original Betrayal ### Mid Campaign (Levels 6-10):

1. **The Order Revealed**: The party discovers Goldwave's connection to the Order of the Shattered Crown
2. **Shard Hunt**: Direct missions to locate and secure one of the Seven Shards
3. **Family Sins**: Investigating other descendants of the Betrayers leads to moral complexities
4. **The Corruption Crisis**: Goldwave needs help containing a crystal corruption outbreak he accidentally caused ### Late Campaign (Levels 11+):

1. **The Time Gambit**: Goldwave reveals his plan to undo the original betrayal and asks for the party's help
2. **Redemption's Price**: The party must choose between supporting his temporal plan or stopping him
3. **The Betrayer's Legacy**: Confronting the consequences of ancestral sins across multiple timelines
4. **The Golden Sacrifice**: Goldwave's final attempt at redemption threatens to unravel reality itself ### The Goldwave Fortune

- **Crystal Trade Monopoly**: Controls 60% of safe crystal transport in Aethermoor
- **Real Estate**: Owns prime properties in five major cities
