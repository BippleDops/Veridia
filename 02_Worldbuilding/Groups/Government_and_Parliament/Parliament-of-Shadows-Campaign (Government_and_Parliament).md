## Organization Overview

The Parliament-of-Shadows-Campaign represents a groundbreaking political movement working to establish formal political representation for shadow-touched individuals across both [[Aquabyssos]] and [[Aethermoor]]. This unprecedented cross-realm political campaign addresses the unique challenges faced by individuals whose transformation connects them to both worlds while often leaving them without adequate representation in either.

Unlike single-realm political movements, this organization recognizes that shadow transformation creates communities and interests that transcend traditional geographical and political boundaries. Shadow-touched individuals often face similar challenges regardless of which realm they inhabit, while also possessing unique perspectives and capabilities that could benefit goverce in both worlds.

The campaign operates as both advocacy organization and practical political movement, working to elect shadow-touched representatives to existing governmental bodies while also proposing new institutional structures that could better serve the needs of transformed populations. Their ultimate goal is the establishment of a formal "Parliament of Shadows" with recognized authority to represent shadow community interests in inter-realm affairs.

### The Representation Gap (5 years ago)
As shadow-touched populations grew in both realms, it became clear that existing political institutions were not adequately representing their unique needs and perspectives. Traditional representatives, lacking personal experience with shadow transformation, often failed to understand or advocate for shadow community interests.

### The Cross-Realm Connection (4 years ago)
**Campaign Director Umbra Bridgeworth**, a shadow-touched individual with the rare ability to travel easily between realms, began building networks connecting shadow communities across both worlds. These connections revealed shared challenges and common political interests transcending realm boundaries.

### The Campaign Formation (3 years ago)
Recognizing the potential power of unified shadow political action, Bridgeworth organized the first formal campaign to elect shadow-touched representatives to governmental bodies in both realms while advocating for new inter-realm institutions.

### The Electoral Breakthrough (2 years ago)
The campaign achieved its first major success with the election of several shadow-touched individuals to local and regional offices, demonstrating the political potential of organized shadow community action.

### The Institutional Advocacy Era (1 year ago - Present)
Building on electoral successes, the campaign now actively works to establish new governmental institutions specifically designed to represent shadow community interests across both realms.

### The Campaign Director
**Umbra Bridgeworth**: A charismatic political organizer whose shadow transformation enables unique insights into both realms' political systems. Her ability to build bridges between diverse communities and her deep understanding of shadow transformation challenges make her an effective advocate for shadow political representation.

### The Strategic Council
The governing body consists of six **Campaign Strategists**, each focusing on different aspects of political advocacy and representation:

#### **Democratic Representation**
All individuals affected by government decisions should have meaningful voice in those decisions. Shadow-touched individuals deserve representation proportional to their population and reflecting their unique perspectives.

#### **Cross-Realm Cooperation**
Issues affecting shadow-touched communities often transcend realm boundaries and require coordinated responses. New governmental institutions should reflect these trans-realm realities.

#### **Equality and Non-Discrimination**
Shadow transformation should not result in loss of political rights or social opportunities. Laws and policies should protect against discrimination while recognizing legitimate differences in needs and capabilities.

#### **Community Self-Determination**
Shadow communities should have maximum autonomy over their internal affairs while participating fully in broader democratic processes.

#### **Transparency and Accountability**
Political representatives should be accountable to their constituents through transparent processes and regular communication about their activities and decisions.

#### **Progressive Political Parties**
**Relationship**: Strategic Partnership
Collaborates with political parties supporting civil rights and inclusive democracy while maintaining independence on shadow-specific issues.

#### **Civil Rights Organizations**

#### **[[The Shadow Warren|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/The Shadow Warren]]**

#### **[[Parliament of Echoes|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/Parliament Of Echoes]]** (Aquabyssos)

#### **[[The Crystal Throne]]** (Aethermoor)
