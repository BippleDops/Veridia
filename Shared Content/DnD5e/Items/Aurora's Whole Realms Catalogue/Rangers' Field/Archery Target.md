## Description
As the dwarven saying goes, “No sword is ever sharp enough.” So too, no ranger’s aim is ever perfect enough. Those who can hit the bullseye should learn to split the shaft. We offer a number of targets to aid users of missile weapons. Our 2' diameter circular target (1 sp) is made of linen and straw and marked at its exact center with a black X. Our 1' diameter circular target (3 sp) is made of 2" thick cork. We also offer a pair of 1' targets mounted on a pivoting board and stand (5 gp). By pulling a long cord, the archer can set the targets to spinning, adding a new challenge to the task.

## Additional Details
2 months spent solely in practice with these targets may allow an additional weapon proficiency, as per training rules (DMG, Ch. 8)
