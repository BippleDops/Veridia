The Deep Oracle represents those who have touched the consciousness of the [[Deep Mother and survived with their sanity intact—or at least functional. These warlocks serve as prophets, investigators, and sometimes reluctant agents of an entity that exists beyond conventional reality. They possess unparalleled insight into cosmic truths at the cost of gradually losing their connection to mundane existence. ## Core Concept

Deep Oracles are warlocks whose patron is the [Deep Mother]], an eldritch entity dwelling in the deepest trenches of reality itself. Unlike traditional Great Old One warlocks, Deep Oracles maintain a semi-voluntary relationship with their patron, trading visions of cosmic truth for the ability to perceive and prevent reality-threatening catastrophes. They often work to prevent the very apocalypse their patron might cause. ### Warlock Patron: The Deep Mother

At 1st level, Deep Oracle Warlocks form a pact with the Deep Mother entity: #### Expanded Spell List

| Spell Level | Spells |
|-------------|--------|
| 1st | *Detect Evil and Good*, *Protection from Evil and Good* |
| 2nd | *Detect Thoughts*, *Locate Object* |
| 3rd | *Clairvoyance*, *Sending* |
| 4th | *Divination*, *Locate Creature* |
| 5th | *Modify Memory*, *Scrying* | ### Pact of the Tome: Cosmic Codex

Your Book of Shadows contains cosmic equations, prophetic diagrams, and reality maps. It can:
- Predict outcomes of major decisions (once per day)
- Store memories extracted from willing creatures
- Communicate with other Deep Oracles across dimensions
- Reveal hidden connections between seemingly unrelated events ### Pact of the Chain: Void Familiar

Your familiar is a creature from the spaces between reality:
- **Cosmic Parasite**: Tiny aberration, can phase in and out of reality
- **Memory Mite**: Stores and retrieves memories from living creatures
- **Reality Tick**: Detects dimensional instability and magical corruption
- **Prophetic Imp**: Provides warnings about immediate future dangers ### Pact of the Blade: Void Cutter

Your pact weapon can cut through reality itself:
- Deals force damage instead of normal weapon damage
- Can harm incorporeal creatures as if they were corporeal
- Critical hits cause reality tears (minor magical effects for 1 round)
- Can be summoned from anywhere on same plane of existence ### Feature: Prophetic Network

You have contacts among oracles, diviners, and cosmic scholars throughout both worlds. They will share prophetic visions, cosmic theories, and warnings about reality threats. However, this network attracts attention from those who prefer the future remain unknown. ### Warlock/Divination Wizard

Enhanced prophetic abilities and spell slot recovery for extended divination. ### Warlock/Knowledge Cleric

Divine magic complements cosmic awareness with enhanced research and information gathering. ### Warlock/Great Old One Warlock

For characters serving multiple cosmic entities or experiencing patron conflicts. ### Warlock/Aberrant Mind Sorcerer

Natural psychic abilities enhanced by cosmic contact. ## Cosmic Horror Elements

Deep Oracles incorporate cosmic horror themes while remaining playable characters. They balance terrifying cosmic awareness with heroic agency, serving as bridges between incomprehensible entities and mortal concerns. The build emphasizes the price of cosmic knowledge while providing meaningful character agency. This character represents the intersection of cosmic horror and heroic fantasy, perfect for campaigns exploring reality, prophecy, and the price of forbidden knowledge. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*
