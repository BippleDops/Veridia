There are no modern technologies, signs, sci-fi UIs, blooming glares or anime styles. It's a unique vision of aquatic fantasy realism, set during the golden hour on the cusp of a storm, where bioluminescent corals or cloudstones illuminate the seascape. Figures and vehicles add a sense of scale, while pressure-dome materials add a sense of depth. The environment thrives with weather indications and particles, set in teals, deep blues, sea-greens, and pearl highlights. Any patterns or signs are unobtrusive and meaningful, avoiding recognizable texts or sentences, instead opting for simple symbols or numbered pins.",
