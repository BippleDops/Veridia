# Tinderstrike
*Weapon ([[dagger-xphb|dagger]]), legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/tinderstrike.webp#right)

- **Damage**: 1d4 piercing
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [[item-properties#Finesse|Finesse]], [[item-properties#Light|Light]], [[item-properties#Thrown|Thrown]]
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

A flint dagger, Tinderstrike is uncommonly sharp, and sparks cascade off its edge whenever it strikes something solid. Its handle is always warm to the touch, and the blade smolders for `d4` minutes after it is used to deal damage. It contains a spark of [[imix-pota|Imix]], Prince of Evil Fire.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra `2d6` fire damage.

## Fire Mastery

You gain the following benefits while you hold Tinderstrike:

- You can speak Ig fluently.  
- You have resistance to fire damage.  
- You can cast [[dominate-monster-xphb|dominate monster]] (save DC 17) on a [[fire-elemental-xmm|fire elemental]]. Once you have done so, Tinderstrike can't be used this way again until the next dawn.  

## Dance of the All-Consuming Fire

While inside a fire node, you can perform a ritual called the Dance of the All-Consuming Fire, using Tinderstrike to create a [[devastation-orb-of-fire-pota|devastation orb of fire]]. Once you perform the ritual, Tinderstrike can't be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn.

## Flaw

Tinderstrike makes its wielder impatient and rash. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I act without thinking and take risks without weighing the consequences."
