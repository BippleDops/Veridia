# Favor Exchange Networks
*The Currency of Obligation and the Economy of Trust*

> *"Gold can be stolen, crystals can be corrupted, pearls can be lost. But a favor? A favor is a debt that lives in the soul, earning interest in ways that compound forever."* - [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Cultural Mediator Coral Windweave]]

## Overview
Beyond the traditional currencies of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], sophisticated networks of non-monetary exchange operate throughout both realms. These favor economies represent complex webs of obligation, reciprocity, and social capital that often prove more valuable and enduring than any material currency.

## The Philosophy of Favor Economics

### Fundamental Principles

#### Reciprocal Obligation
Every favor creates a corresponding debt that must be repaid with interest - not monetary interest, but social and moral compound growth. The longer a favor remains unpaid, the greater the social pressure and the more elaborate the expected repayment becomes.

#### Trust Multipliers
Successful favor exchanges increase both parties' capacity to engage in future favor trading. A reputation for honoring obligations becomes a form of social credit that allows access to increasingly valuable favor networks.

#### Contextual Value
Unlike monetary transactions with fixed values, favors derive their worth from timing, relationship dynamics, social context, and the specific needs of the participants. The same action might be worthless in one context and priceless in another.

#### Non-Transferable Obligations
Favor debts cannot be sold, traded, or assigned to others. They exist only between the original parties, creating personal relationships that transcend economic abstractions.

### Social Hierarchy and Favor Values

## Player-Facing Summary

Favor Exchange Networks represent the social economy of obligation and reciprocity that exists alongside monetary commerce. Understanding these networks provides access to resources and relationships that cannot be purchased with money, while creating complex social obligations that drive character development and adventure.

## Lore Details

Ancient social theorists speak of the "Great Favor" - a mythical obligation that supposedly underlies all of reality, creating the fundamental reciprocal relationship between existence and non-existence. Some philosophers suggest that every action creates cosmic favor obligations that must eventually be balanced.

Deep-sea culture keepers maintain that the pressure of the depths makes favor obligations physically manifest, creating visible auras around those who carry heavy social debts. They claim that at extreme depths, unfulfilled favors become so heavy they can crush the bearer.

## Adventure Hooks

- A dying noble reveals they have been maintaining a favor network that secretly controls the kingdom's politics, and the party must decide whether to inherit these obligations or let the network collapse
- An ancient favor debt comes due, requiring the party to fulfill an obligation that was reasonable centuries ago but is now morally questionable or practically impossible
- The party discovers that their routine business dealings have created a complex web of favor obligations that different cultural groups interpret in conflicting ways

## DM Notes

Use favor networks to create ongoing character relationships and long-term campaign consequences. Unlike monetary transactions, favor obligations create personal bonds that can drive character development and provide adventure motivation across multiple sessions.

Consider how different cultural backgrounds create different expectations about favor obligations. Characters from different districts or realms may have very different ideas about what constitutes appropriate favor exchange, creating role-playing opportunities and potential conflicts.

The non-monetary nature of favor networks allows characters to access resources and opportunities that money cannot buy, while creating social obligations that limit their freedom of action in interesting ways. This creates a different type of resource management challenge that emphasizes relationships over wealth.
