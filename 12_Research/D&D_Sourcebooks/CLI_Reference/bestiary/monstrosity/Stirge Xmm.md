*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 299. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* A single stirge is usually little more than an annoyance, but several can be deadly if they attach faster than a victim can remove them. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Stirges *Notorious, Clinging Bloodsuckers* - **Habitat.** Desert, Forest, Grassland, Hill, Mountain, Swamp, Underdark, Urban - **Treasure.** None Stirges are bat-size vermin with dagger-length proboscises that attach to other creatures and drain life from them. Stirges are most active at night and hide in shadowy places during the day. If disturbed, they take flight and defend themselves. Roll on or choose a result from the Stirge Roosts table to inspire where stirges might lurk. **Stirge Roosts**`dice: [](stirge-xmm.md#^stirge-roosts)`| dice: 1d4 | Between Hunts, the Stirge Lurks In... |

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of stirge xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around stirge xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Shadow Covenant - Achieve immortality ## Plot Hooks - Strange disappearances suggest a portal
