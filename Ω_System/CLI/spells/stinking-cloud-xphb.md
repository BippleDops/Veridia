# Stinking Cloud
*3rd-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a rotten egg)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a point within range. The cloud is [Heavily Obscured](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/heavily-obscured-xphb.md). The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a strong wind (such as the one created by [Gust of Wind](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/gust-of-wind-xphb.md)) disperses it.

Each creature that starts its turn in the [Sphere](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have the [Poisoned](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition until the end of the current turn. While [Poisoned](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) in this way, the creature can't take an action or a [Bonus Action](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md).

**Classes**: [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Warlock (Fiend Patron)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-fiend-patron-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Druid (Circle of the Land)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-circle-of-the-land-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard (College of Lore)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
