--- # Fire Shield

*4th-level, Evocation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or a firefly)
- **Duration:** 10 minutes Wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding [[Light Xphb]] in a 10-foot radius and [[Light Xphb]] for an additional 10 feet. The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you [[boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats)]] to Cold damage, and the chill shield grants you [[boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats)]] to Fire damage. In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack roll, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes`2d8`Fire damage from a warm shield or`2d8`Cold damage from a chill shield. **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 274.
