--- # Familiars

*Source: Monster Manual p. 347* Any spellcaster that can cast the [[find-familiar-xphb (spells) spell (such as an apprentice, warlock, or wizard) is likely to have a familiar. The familiar can be one of the creatures described in the spell (see the "Player's Handbook") or some other Tiny monster, such as a [crawling-claw-xmm (undead)]], an [[Imp Xmm, a [pseudodragon-xmm (dragon)]], or a [[quasit-xmm (fiend)]]. > [!note]

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of familiars mm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around familiars mm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A document has gone missing and evil awakens
