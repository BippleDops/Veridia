*Level 5 Bastion facility* - **Prerequisites**: Ability to use a [[Symbol Xphb]] or [[druidic-focus-xphb (items)]] as a [[spellcasting-focus-xphb (variant-rules)]]
- **Space**: Roomy (16 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 1
- **Order**: craft Icons of your religion are displayed in this facility, which includes a quiet place for worship. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Sanctuary Charm After spending a Long Rest in your Bastion, you gain a magical [[Sanctuary Charm Xdmg]] (see ""Supernatural Gifts"" in "chapter 3") that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast [[mass-healing-word-xphb (spells)]] once without expending a spell slot. You can't gain this Charm again while you still have it. ## Craft: Sacred Focus When you issue the "Craft" order to this facility, you commission the facility's hireling to craft a [[druidic-focus-xphb (items)]] ([[Staff Xphb]]) or a [[Symbol Xphb]]. The work takes 7 days and costs no money. The item remains in your Bastion until you claim it. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 345* ## Player-Facing Summary Sanctuary is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of sanctuary as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around sanctuary. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A stranger needs help finding before winter
