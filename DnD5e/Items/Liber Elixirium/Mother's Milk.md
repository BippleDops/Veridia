# Mother's Milk
## Overview
For the calming and soothing relief from feelings of [[Frightened|fear]], panic, terror, and dread.

**Hue:** Gray Smoke

**Taste:** Sweet

**Recipe**

4 oz. Sanicle leaves and stems, dried

1 1/4 oz. Hematite, ground

2 cups [[Goat|goat]]’s milk

1 oz. Lamassu Feather, powdered

1. Place [[Goat|goat]]’s milk in a small [[Cauldron|cauldron]] and heat until steam rises. Do not boil.
1. Add Hematite and Lamassu feather powder. Stir until liquid takes on a dark gray hue. Add dried Sanicle leaves and stems and stir exactly 40 strokes counter clockwise.
1. Remove from [[Heat Source|heat source]] and allow to cool 30 minutes. As mixture cools it will lighten two to three shades in hue.
