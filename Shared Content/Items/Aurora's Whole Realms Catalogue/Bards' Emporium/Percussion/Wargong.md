## Description
These broad, heavy disks of copper produce a sudden, thunderous sound when struck heavily, and a sustained rumble when mallets roll upon the surface. Our wargongs have sounded from high courts to battlefields; chains of them send signals from outpost to outpost across hundreds of miles. Because our craftsmen for these instruments reside in Shou Lung, and because each wargong is an unique work of art, wargongs must be special ordered. Prices vary with availability.
