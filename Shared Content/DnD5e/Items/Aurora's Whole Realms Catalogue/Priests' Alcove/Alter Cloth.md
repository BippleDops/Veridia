## Description
As powerful tools of faith, altars deserve fitting adornment. We offer a 6' by 14' altar cloth that can drape or be folded to fit smaller altars.

Our altar cloths are white and come in the following materials: linen (15 gp); velvet (30 gp); silk (35 gp); gold brocade (40 gp).

For an additional 5 gp, any material but the brocade can be dyed red, blue, yellow, green, or brown. We also supply a 2' by 2' cloth for our altar cases (3 gp).
