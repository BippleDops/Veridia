## Overview
The Independent Smugglers represent a loose confederation of opportunistic traders who operate in the dangerous spaces between [[Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos]]. Unlike organized crime syndicates, they maintain their independence while sharing information, resources, and protection. They fill the crucial economic niche of moving goods that both realms need but officially prohibit, making them simultaneously essential and outlawed by both governments.

### Operating Cells
**The Deep Runners**
- Specialists in [[Aquabyssos]] routes
- Focus on memory trading and shadow artifacts
- Led by [[Jasper "Three-Eyes" Flint|02 Worldbuilding/People/Jasper "Three Eyes" Flint]] (unofficial ties)

**The Surface Skimmers** 
- Operate primarily in [[Aethermoor]] waters
- Crystal smuggling and luxury goods
- Work closely with corrupt port officials

**The Transition Riders**
- Masters of the dangerous depth-change routes
- Specialize in moving people between realms
- Highest casualty rate but best profits

**The Ghost Fleet**
- Vessels that officially don't exist
- Handle the most dangerous and illegal cargo
- Only called upon for extreme situations

### The Smuggler's Code
1. **Never rat out another smuggler** - Absolute rule, death penalty for violation
2. **Honor your contracts** - Word is bond in illegal trades
3. **No unnecessary violence** - Bad for business and draws attention
4. **Share route information** - Critical safety information is communal
5. **Help fellow smugglers in distress** - Mutual aid obligation
