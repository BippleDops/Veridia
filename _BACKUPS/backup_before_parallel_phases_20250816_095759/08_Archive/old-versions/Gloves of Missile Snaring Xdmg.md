--- # Gloves of Missile Snaring

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/gloves-of-missile-snaring.webp#right) If you're hit by an attack roll made with a Ranged or Thrown weapon while wearing these gloves, you can take a [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules)]] to reduce the damage by`d10`plus your Dexterity modifier if you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the ammunition or weapon if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 265.
