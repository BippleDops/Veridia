## Description
An assortment of glass “pretties” for a plethora of uses! The most unusual use I have seen was in Aum, where these were placed in the bottom of a clear glass vase in which flowers were placed. They not only weighted the vase, they held the blooms in place as well! A bag of beads contains at least ten varieties, of differing sizes. Both native and imported. Glass beads: 25 sp per bag.
