## Special Traits
**Camouflage:** While lying flat on the ground, a flagstone golem can't be distinguished from normal floor.

**Energy Absorption:** If a flagstone golem is hit by an attack that causes damage of a type it is immune to, it takes no damage but instead heals 1 hit point per 3 points of damage the attack would have inflicted. Excess hit points are gained as temporary hit points.

**Energy Burst:** As an action, a flagstone golem can "release" temporary hit points as a blast of energy. All creatures within 20 feet of the flagstone golem take force damage equal to the number of temporary hit points being released, or half damage with a successful DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. This attack expels all of the flagstone golem's temporary hit points.

**Flatten:** As an action, a flagstone golem can flatten itself onto the ground and become indistinguishable from normal flagstone flooring or any other flat, stone surface. While flattened, the golem becomes immune to all the damage types it is normally resistant to. Resuming humanoid shape takes another action.

**Magic Resistance:** A flagstone golem has tactical advantage on saving throws versus spells and magical effects.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A flagstone golem attacks twice with fists.

**Fist:** *Melee Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (`dice: 2d10+4`) bludgeoning damage. If both attacks hit the same target, the target must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be knocked prone and stunned until the start of the flagstone golem's next turn.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
A flagstone golem is composed of flagstones—large, flat stones used in paving and flooring—jointed and fitted together so as to allow the creature to fold itself flat. They are created to serve as guardians or servants by powerful spellcasters, and have been the death of many an unsuspecting rogue. They are most useful in situations where something needs to be protected but without having obvious guards around it. Standing unfolded and upright, a flagstone golem stands 10 feet tall. Its humanoid form is composed of flat stones (and occasionally bricks). Two darkened sockets on its head function as eyes. Its arms are thick and powerful and end in stony, clenched fists.

Though a flagstone golem can’t converse, its creator can program up to four simple words or phrases (no more than four words in length) into it. Those words are spoken by the golem when specified conditions are met. These conditions are programmed into the golem when it is constructed. Conditions can be as general or specific as the golem’s creator wants, but they must be fairly simple, such as “if anyone but me enters this room, say ‘go back’,” or “if anyone but me touches this book, say ‘don’t be foolish’.”

A flagstone golem tasked with guarding or securing a location usually flattens itself onto the floor so it will go unnoticed until too late.For obvious reasons, those who create such golems usually design the rooms where the golems will stand guard with an eye toward giving the golem plenty of camouflage. When an interloper violates the conditions set out by the golem’s creator, it rises into its humanoid form and attacks with powerful blows from its fists.

A flagstone golem is constructed from brick, stone, various powders, and exotic liquids totaling 2,500 gp in value.
