# Pre-Submersion Ruins

![[04_Resources/Assets/Art/Lore/Pre-Submersion_Ruins.png|Pre-Submersion Ruins Portrait

## Summary
Pre-Submersion Ruins describes a turning current in history where choices about memory, depth, and sovereignty reshaped travel, trade, and ritual.

## Historical Context
- Origin: Scribal disputes escalated into pressure-lock conflicts.
- Spread: Merchant routes adopted secret signs to bypass tariffs; songs encoded depth-keys.
- Present: Competing narratives justify new taxes, oaths, and contraband routes.

## What It Means at the Table
- Investigation: On a lead toward old tariffs, players can extract schedules that reduce travel risks for a session.
- Social: Reciting the chapel oath grants advantage on one Persuasion check if honored afterward.
- Exploration: Recognizing encoded waystones reduces the chance of getting lost by one step.

## Threads and Revelations
- Records implicate agents tied to [02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Sunken Library of Thalassius]].
- A rite echoes the activation cadence needed for [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos.
- Testimony suggests [02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]] financed a pivotal bribe.
