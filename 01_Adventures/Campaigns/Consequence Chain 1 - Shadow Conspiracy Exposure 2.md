## Initial Action

**What the players did:**

- Confronted memory farmers in the Memory Meadows and rescued Senator Glaucus
- Uncovered evidence of systematic shadow replacement throughout Parliament
- Discovered shadow surgery facilities in Tenebrarum
- Exposed the scope of The Shadow Conspiracy to key government officials

**Who was directly affected:**
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Original Glaucus**: Rescued from Memory Meadows imprisonment
- **[02_Worldbuilding/People/Shadow Duchess Nyx]]**: Plans compromised, forced to accelerate timeline

- **[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Parliament of Echoes]]**: Learned 30% of members are shadow replacements
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Scattered Emperor**: Paranoia validated, authority challenged
- **Memory Farmers**: Primary income source disrupted, key operatives captured

**Immediate visible results:**
- High tide shadow activation prevented through party intervention
- Senator Glaucus's testimony provided to Parliament leadership
- Memory farming operation in Memory Meadows shut down
- Shadow surgery schedules and target lists recovered
- Party member reflection crisis resolved through negotiation/banishment
- Tuning Fork and harmonic knowledge gained from The Conductor

## Primary Ripples (Days/Weeks)

**Economic impacts:**
