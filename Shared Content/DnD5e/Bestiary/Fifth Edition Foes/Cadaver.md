## Special Traits
**Cadaver Fever:** At the end of a battle against cadavers, anyone who was clawed or bitten by a cadaver must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw against disease. Failure indicates the character is infected with cadaver fever. An infected character gains one level of exhaustion immediately and must repeat the saving throw at the end of every long rest. Each failed saving throw adds one more level of exhaustion; a successful saving throw at the end of a long rest means only that the character's condition doesn't worsen. The character recovers fully when he or she makes successful saving throws at the ends of two consecutive long rests or when lesser restoration or comparable magic is used on the character.

**Reanimation:** When reduced to 0 hit points, a cadaver is not destroyed; rather it falls inert and begins regaining 1 hit point per round. Hit points lost to magical weapons or spells are not regained. When the creature reaches its full hit point total (minus damage dealt by magical attacks and weapons), it reassembles itself and stands up, ready to fight again. Scattering or even destroying the pieces of its body don't prevent it from magically reassembling and reanimating. If gentle repose is cast on the cadaver when it is at 0 hit points, it can't reanimate. A bless spell delays the reanimation, causing the creature to regain 1 hit point per minute instead of per round.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The cadaver bites once and attacks once with claws.

**Bite:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d8+1`) piercing damage and the target may be infected with cadaver fever (see above).

**Claw:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (`dice: 2d6+1`) slashing damage and the target may be infected with cadaver fever (see above).

**Environment**: Any

**Organization**: Solitary or troupe ([[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/A-G/Cadaver Lord|cadaver lord]] plus 1â€“4 cadavers)

## Description
Cadavers are the skeletal remains of people who were buried alive or given an improper burial (an unmarked grave or mass grave for example). They can be found haunting graveyards and cemeteries.

Cadavers are infused with a hatred that rivals many other undead creatures. This hatred is directed toward its own existence as well as the existence of all living creatures. Thus, the cadaver attacks all creatures it encounters. They have a distinct hatred for light, but it does not damage them. All encounters with cadavers are at night or in places cloaked in darkness.

Encounters are most often with a solitary creature. Multiple cadavers do not work in concert with each other, though they do not attack each other. Being mindless, they simply charge into combat with no thought for tactics or finesse.

Cadavers are sometimes found in the employ of greater undead such as wights or ghasts.

A cadaver attacks by raking with its filthy claws or biting with its sharp, disease-infested teeth. They often lie in shallow graves waiting for potential victims to wander too close, where they immediately spring to the attack, raking and biting until destroyed or until all foes are dead.
