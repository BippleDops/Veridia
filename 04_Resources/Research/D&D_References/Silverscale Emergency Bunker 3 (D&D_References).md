The Silverscale Emergency Bunker is a heavily fortified underground facility designed to protect key personnel and resources during catastrophic events affecting Aethermoor. Built by the Silverscale organization using both surface and underwater engineering techniques, it represents one of the most secure locations in the surface realm. The bunker features advanced life support systems, magical shielding, and secure communication networks linking it to both realms. ## Historical Background

Constructed during a period of increasing inter-realm tensions, the bunker was designed to serve as a command center and refuge for Silverscale leadership during crises. Its creation required unprecedented cooperation between surface architects and underwater pressure-engineering specialists. ## Current State

The bunker remains on standby alert, fully stocked and ready for immediate occupation. Recent dimensional instabilities have triggered several false alarms, leading to reviews of activation protocols. ### Duration

Designed for sustained operation up to one year without external support. ## Adventure Hooks

1. **Bunker Infiltration**: Characters must gain access during an emergency
2. **False Alarm**: Investigate what triggered unauthorized activation
3. **Siege Scenario**: Protect or attack the bunker during a crisis ## Campaign Use

Provides secure meeting location, refuge during disasters, or target for infiltration missions. ## Player-Facing Summary Silverscale Emergency Bunker is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Silverscale Emergency Bunker as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Silverscale Emergency Bunker. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Strange disappearances suggest a curse
