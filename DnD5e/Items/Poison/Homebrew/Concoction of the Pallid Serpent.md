# Concoction of the Pallid Serpent
## Overview
Created from the paste made by grinding up leaves of the [[Cat]]’s Breath plant , and combined with the pungeant juice made from King’s Pear seeds, this milky substance has a rather intoxicating aroma that often is mistaken for cooked meat. The [[Poisoned|poison]] has a slightly bitter taste, yet it often goes unnoticed.

Upon ingestion, the victim begins experiencing terrible headaches and visual hallucinations. They often see things twisting and warping, with vile and hideous creatures seeking to cause them [[Harm|harm]]. Those in the throes of the [[Poisoned|poison]] often lash out at those around them, believeing that they have suddenly been surrounded by monstrousities. A few unfortunate souls have

survived the experience, and the mark of paranoia often follows them until the end of their days.
