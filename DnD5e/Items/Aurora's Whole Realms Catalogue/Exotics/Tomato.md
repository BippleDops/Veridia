## Description
During my journeys in Maztica, I had several opportunities to taste this unique crop fresh-picked. While this delicate red fruit cannot survive the long journey across the ocean, it can fortunately be dried, which only intensifies the sweetness of its flavor. Packed in [[Oils|oils]], dried tomato can be used in soups, salads, and candies. (10 gp/pt.)
