### 🎯 What's Happening Now

The system is autonomously:
1. **Scanning** all 8,817 markdown files in the vault
2. **Generating** context-aware images for each file
3. **Creating** ambient audio for location files
4. **Producing** video animations for combat scenes
5. **Updating** markdown files with asset references
6. **Tracking** progress with resume capability

### 💡 Next Steps

The system will continue running in the background. You can:
- Let it run overnight for maximum generation
- Check progress periodically
- Stop safely with process termination
- Resume anytime if interrupted
