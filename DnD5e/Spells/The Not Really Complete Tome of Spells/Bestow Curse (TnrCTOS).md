# Bestow Curse (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
These are new variants of the spell *bestow curse* that appears in the *Player’s Handbook*, pg.218. Most of these variants are useful only if you are casting the spell with a 7th-level or higher spell slot.

♦ The target is in pain. It has disad-vantage on all Dexterity skill checks its speed is reduced by 10 feet.

♦ The target exudes an aura of antipa-thy, causing creatures to have hostile feelings towards it. While cursed, the target has dis-advantage on Deception and Persuasion skill checks.

♦ The creature is either deafened or blinded.

♦ The creature gains a deadly touch. Everything it touches takes 1d10 damage of a type of your choice. It cannot turn off this ability.

♦ The target develops an obviously su-pernatural and disturbing (and often ironic) physical trait. The creature may grow a pig’s noise, pure black eyes, have its hair turn into serpents, smell like sulfur, and so on. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on De-ception and Persuasion skill checks.

♦ The creature becomes insatiable. Whenever food or drink is present, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or stop whatever it is doing in order to eat or drink.

♦ Whenever the creature encounters a particular substance, it becomes incredibly nauseated. It must make a Constitution sav-ing throw or become incapacitated for 1d6 rounds due to vomiting and dry heaves.
