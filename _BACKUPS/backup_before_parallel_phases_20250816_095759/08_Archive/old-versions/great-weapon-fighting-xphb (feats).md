*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 209. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* When you roll damage for an attack you make with a Melee weapon that you are holding with two hands, you can treat any 1 or 2 on a damage die as a 3. The weapon must have the Two-Handed or Versatile property to gain this benefit. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Great weapon fighting xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
