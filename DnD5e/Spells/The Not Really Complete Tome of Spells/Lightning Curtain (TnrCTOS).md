# Lightning Curtain (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 120 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of amber, a bit of fur, and a square of fine velvet)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
You create a wall of crackling lightning. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 lightning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

Any creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of the wall and wearing metal armor will attract a spark and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 lightning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell, deals 5d8 lightning dam-age to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A crea-ture takes the same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
