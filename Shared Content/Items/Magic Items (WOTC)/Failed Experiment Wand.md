# Failed Experiment Wand

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Wand

**Rarity:** rare

**Attunement**: *requires attunement* by a spellcaster

**Weight**: 1 lbs.

## Description

This wand has 2 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast either a green-flamed [[fireball]] or a blue [[lightning bolt]]  at random from it (save DC 15).

For 1 charge, you cast the 3rd-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.

The wand regains `dice: 1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice: d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
