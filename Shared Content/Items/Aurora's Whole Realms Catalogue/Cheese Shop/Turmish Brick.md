## Description
A crumbly, square burgundy cheese made with the heavy red wine found in the region. The wine itself travels poorly, but when mixed into the cheese provides a sweet concoction that is popular as far north as Neverwinter. Made in great platters, the Turmish brick is ripened and carved, and each loaf is wrapped in red wax, giving the cheese its common appearance. Available in 1 lb rectangular loaves (4 sp) and 100 gp cubic wheys (35 gp)
