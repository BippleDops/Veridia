*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/slippers-of-spider-climbing.webp#right) While you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a [[Climb Speed Xphb equal to your [Fly Speed Xphb]]. However, the slippers don't allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 304.
