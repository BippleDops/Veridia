# Obedience (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a golden circlet, neck-lace, or bracelet worth at least 1,000 gp)

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
You place the circlet, necklace, or bracelet on an aberration, dragon, humanoid, giant, or monstrosity with an Intelligence of 5 or more, and then cast the spell. The creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature is bound by the circlet and cannot remove it.

While wearing the circlet, you may issue orders to the creature. If the creature refuses the order, you may activate the circlet. For each round the circlet is activated, the crea-ture suffers 1d10 psychic damage and is stunned due to incredible pain. You may deactivate the circlet at any time.

You may choose to remove the circlet at any time. A *dispel magic, remove curse,* or *wish* spell also will remove it. Finally, at every midnight, the creature, if it is awake, can make a new saving throw at disadvantage. On a success, the creature can remove the circlet and is freed.
