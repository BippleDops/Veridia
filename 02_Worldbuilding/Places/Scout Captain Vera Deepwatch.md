# Deepwatch Outpost
*Eyes in the Deepest Dark*

> *"Out here at the edge of the known world, we are civilization's first and last line of warning. Every shadow could hide a threat, every current might carry danger, every silence might precede catastrophe. We watch so others may sleep safely."*
> â€” [[Scout Captain Vera Deepwatch]], Commanding Officer and Chief Scout

## Overview

Deepwatch Outpost serves as [[Aquabyssos]]'s most remote reconnaissance station, positioned at the extreme depths where [[Scout Captain Vera Deepwatch]] leads a small but elite team of scouts in monitoring threats from the deepest reaches of the ocean.
