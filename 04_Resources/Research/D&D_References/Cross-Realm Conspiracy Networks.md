--- ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview **Cross-Realm Conspiracy Networks** represent the shadowy underworld that has evolved alongside legitimate inter-realm cooperation. These criminal organizations exploit the jurisdictional complexities, cultural misunderstandings, and regulatory gaps that exist between Aquabyssos and Aethermoor, creating sophisticated smuggling routes and illegal operations that span both realms. Unlike simple criminal gangs, these networks have developed into complex organizations with their own codes of conduct, territorial agreements, and specialized techniques for avoiding detection by authorities from either realm. ### The Pressure Runners **Leadership**: Unknown figurehead called "The Deep Voice" who communicates only through coded pressure wave transmissions **Specialty**: Smuggling goods that require specific pressure conditions, including illegal magical components, restricted technology, and prohibited biological specimens **Operations**:
