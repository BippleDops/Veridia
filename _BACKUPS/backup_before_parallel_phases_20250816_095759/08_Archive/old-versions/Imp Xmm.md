Their abilities to shape-shift and pass unseen make them skillful spies and adept at fleeing danger. Imps sent to surveil other creatures relate what they discover to their masters, but they frequently omit important details or cast events in the worst possible light to mislead their masters into following the imps' devilish council. Imps without masters delight in manipulating other creatures and inflating their own egos. They might take over bands of weaker monsters, or they might pose as helpful spirits and trick influential individuals into pursuing nefarious ends. > [!quote] A quote from Skeever, Imp Servant of Firan Zal'Ho > > I can tell you what I know, but wouldn't you rather I tell you what'll let you do what you know you're going to do anyway?```statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of imp xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around imp xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Strange accidents suggest a conspiracy
