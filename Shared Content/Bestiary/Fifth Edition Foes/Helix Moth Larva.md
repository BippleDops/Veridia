## Description
The lair of an adult helix moth usually can be found in a cave, a tunnel, a volcanic lava tube, or some other, similar structure. The entrances are difficult, if not impossible, for nonflying creatures to reach.

Helix moths are solitary creatures, though on rare occasions a mated pair might be encountered. When the time comes for a female helix moth to lay her eggs, she digs a tunnel down into the floor of her lair that is at least 15 feet long or longer. At its end, she hollows out a chamber at least 20 feet square, then she coats every surface of the tunnel and the chamber with thick, slightly acidic slime. The acid in the slime is weak enough to be harmless, but it tingles unpleasantly when it comes in contact with skin. In that chamber, she deposits up to twelve eggs.

The eggs hatch after just two weeks. If the mother is still around, she brings them food to keep them alive for the first few weeks. Otherwise, the hungry larvae attack and eat each other; this typically results in only half the larvae surviving their first weeks of life.

On rare occasions (1-in–6 chance), the secretions of the larvae react with the slime covering their chamber to form a vapor that’s poisonous to other creatures who inhale it. Creatures other than helix moths breathing the fumes must make a successful DC 11 Con saving throw or take `dice: 1d8` poison damage. The saving throw must be repeated after every minute of continued exposure.

Despite their imposing size and ferocious appearance, helix moths are normally inoffensive creatures toward humanoids. They are nocturnal hunters, and their usual prey is deer, elk, pheasant, and boar. A helix moth journeys up to a mile from its lair in search of prey. Slain prey is carried back to the lair to be eaten.

The exception to this behavior is when a mother helix moth has a brood of larvae to feed. At those times, she becomes quite aggressive, attacking anything made of meat. Ideally, the mother brings something back for her larvae that is unconscious but still alive.
