## Special Traits
***Keen Smell.*** The kruthik has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

***Pack Tactics.*** The kruthik has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the kruthik's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

***Tunneler.*** The kruthik can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The kruthik makes two stab attacks or two spike attacks.

***Stab.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 9 ( `dice: 1d10+4`) piercing damage.

***Spike.** Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ( `dice: 1d6+4`) piercing damage.

***Acid Spray (Recharge 5-6).*** The kruthik sprays acid in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 ( `dice: 4d10`) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Description
A hive lord rules each kruthik hive. When the hive lord dies, the surviving members of the hive abandon their lair and search for a new one. When a suitable location is found, the largest kruthik in the hive undergoes a metamorphosis, forming a cocoon around itself and emerging several weeks later as a hive lordâ€”a bigger and smarter kruthik with the ability to spray digestive acid from its maw. The hive lord claims the largest chamber of the lair and keeps several [[Adult Kruthik|adult kruthiks]] nearby as bodyguards.
