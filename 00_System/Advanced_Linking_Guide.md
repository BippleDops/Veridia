## Advanced Linking Techniques

### Contextual Links
*Links that change meaning based on context*

#### Dynamic References
- `[[NPC_Name]]` → Auto-displays appropriate info based on current file
- `[[Location#Current Events]]` → Shows current happenings
- `[[Quest#Player Status]]` → Shows personalized quest status

#### Conditional Display
```
![[NPC_Name#Combat Stats]] (only if in combat)
![[Location#Social Info]] (only if in social encounter)
```

### Cross-Campaign References
*Linking content across different campaigns*

#### Campaign Prefixes
- `[[AQ_Location_Name]]` (Aquabyssos campaign)
- `[[AE_Location_Name]]` (Aethermoor campaign)
- `[[SH_Location_Name]]` (Shared/neutral content)

#### Universal References
- `[[Rules/Combat]]` → Standard combat rules
- `[[Templates/NPC]]` → NPC creation template
- `[[Resources/Names]]` → Name generation lists

### Smart Link Automation

#### Auto-Completion Patterns
```
Type: Character Name → Suggests: [[Character_Name]]
Type: @Location → Suggests: [[Location_Name]]
Type: #Quest → Suggests: [[Quest_Name]]
```

#### Link Validation
*Automatically check for and suggest corrections*

- Detect broken links
- Suggest similar existing files
- Propose link text improvements
- Flag missing relationships

### Embedded Content Strategy

#### Transclude Patterns
```
![[NPC_Name#Appearance]] → Embed appearance description
![[Location_Name#Map]] → Embed location map
![[Quest_Name#Objectives]] → Embed quest objectives
```

#### Conditional Embeds
```
![[Combat_Rules]] (if encounter_type = "combat")
![[Social_Rules]] (if encounter_type = "social")
```
