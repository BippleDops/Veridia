## Designer's Notes
> [!warning]+ GM Directions
> Aurora’s Catalogue found its beginnings in a pragmatic setting: the gaming table. During a campaign in turn-of-the-century America, Anne Brown happened upon a reprint of a 1902 mail-order catalogue. She brought the catalogue to the next session to let the PCs do some shopping. Over the following weeks, the catalogue proved as handy and oft-referenced as the materials provided for the game; it showed just what was available in 1902, with illustrations, descriptions, and prices for items from plows to electric belts (don’t ask). Clearly, if such a reference could help recreate the familiar world of turn-of-the-century America, a similar catalogue could help recreate the foreign world of medieval fantasy. 
> 
> That’s how Aurora’s Catalogue was conceived. Its maturation, however, was a bit more involved. Anne and I spent many hours poring over materials from the extensive (and frightening) TSR library and the University of Wisconsin Library—among the highest ranked research facilities in the nation. (Jon Pickens’ apartment has a slightly higher ranking: he provided over 20 useful resources, allowed unlimited checkout time, and supplied 24 hour reference.) From over 10,000 pages of material we gleaned loads of authentic medieval items to offer. To these we added many fantastic inventions from the timeless genius of Leonardo Da Vinci—everything from barely functional flying machines to scythe-bladed war wagons. Other contraptions are of our own creation, things calculated to help AD&D® game PCs. Finally, we accessed the mutual brain of Greenwood and Grubb for odd items and peoples of Faerun that should somehow figure into the catalogue. 
> 
> The whole process is summed as follows: every item that appears here is either authentically medieval or suitably fantastic. The best items are both. We purposely avoided magical items (“how much are you asking for the Wand of Orcus?”) because careless acquisition of magic can completely unbalance a game. And in concern for game balance and flavor, DMs should allow themselves absolute latitude in determining the availability of products. A DM whose players face an attack of giant slugs may say that salt is unavailable, or sell it by gross tonnage! DMs who distribute money one copper at a time might begin a green-stamp purchasing program; others who run Monty Haul campaigns may double costs. 
> 
> Aurora’s Guide was meant not only to be flexible in prices, but also in uses. When PCs enter a [[Cheese Shop|cheese shop]], let them page through the cheese section of Aurora’s and read some of the entries to learn what sort of fare appears in the shop. When an angry mob chases a monster to a castle, outfit them with the laborer’s tools as weapons. When you need any adventure idea, call the PCs to the catalogue station and have Aurora hire them to find her lost shipment (of Maztican cotton, Shou Lung silk, etc.). 
> 
> Shop early; shop often. Our hope is that Aurora’s Catalogue will become the most tattered (and loved) book in your gaming collection.


## A Word from Our Founder
**Welcome to Aurora’s Emporium!** 

You are about to embark on the finest shopping experience in all of Faerun. I am pleased to bring you the widest selection of impeccable merchandise available anywhere on the continent. 

No doubt you’ve already thumbed through the pages of this catalogue and admired my wide variety of goods and their lavish descriptions and illustrations. My small staff of scribes and artists has spent countless hours preparing this tome for duplication. A second staff of apprentice mages spends its days magically copying and distributing these volumes to my catalogue outlets. I regret that my catalogues cannot leave the outlets, as public distribution has proven too expensive, but be assured that each outlet is furnished with enough copies so there is never a wait to browse.

> [!warning] Message
> **How Aurora’s Emporium Works** 
> 
> For those of you who are new to my catalogue bazaar, let me explain how my system operates. My agents and I purchase goods from traveling peddlers, wholesalers, individual craftspersons, and a long list of reputable merchants. I never knowingly buy from the black market; my divination spells ensure this! Merchandise is shipped in from the four corners of Faerun to my central warehouse, the location of which is a well-guarded secret. (Incidentally, I move my entire warehouse about once a year to ensure the security of its location.) 
> 
> My catalogue outlets are sprinkled across the continent, in all major cities. Currently, I have six outlets in Waterdeep alone! New outlets are opening monthly—if you’re not near a convenient location now, chances are good that another will open soon! 
> 
> When your order is taken at one of my outlets, it is placed in a batch with other orders from the outlet. Every morning and every evening, orders are teleported to the central warehouse, where the merchandise is picked and batched. My staff assembles an outlet’s orders; then, using magical platforms of teleportation, the orders are shipped to their respective stores. Especially large orders or items are frequently reduced in size magically, then enlarged at the destination. 
> 
> Orders typically arrive at the outlets in two to three days. Outlet staff can advise you on current shipping trends. Shipping times may be slightly longer near major holidays—plan ahead! 
> 
> Orders are processed in the order they are received. The exception to this rule is disaster relief—if a locale is ravaged by fire or flood, for example, their orders for food, blankets, clothing, etc. are always filled first. Again, outlet staff can advise you if such conditions exist.
