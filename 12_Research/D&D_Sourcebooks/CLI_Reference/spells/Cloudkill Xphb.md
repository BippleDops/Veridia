--- # Cloudkill

*5th-level, Conjuration* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes You create a 20-foot-radius [[Area of Effect Xphb]] of yellow-green fog centered on a point within range. The fog lasts for the duration or until strong wind (such as the one created by [[Gust of Wind Xphb]]) disperses it, ending the spell. Its area is [[Heavily Obscured Xphb]]. Each creature in the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] makes a Constitution saving throw, taking`5d8`Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] moves into its space and when it enters the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn. The [[Area of Effect Xphb]] moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your turns. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by`d8`for each spell slot level above 5. **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 251.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of cloudkill xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around cloudkill xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Alliance - Manipulate succession ## Plot Hooks - Someone is hunting information for love
