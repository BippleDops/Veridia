# Trap #45 - ''This Will Really Light Your Fire!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The room entered through the bronze door is 30 by 30 feet with a vaulted ceiling consisting of four triangular panels which meet at a square peak 30 feet overhead.
> 
> On the walls to the right and left are frescoes of a magical being striding through massed hordes of deamons. The creature seems to be a mass of flame with human features.
> 
> In the wall opposite the door is an alcove, in the center of which is a golden chain. draped over a wooden rest. On the chain is a golden amulet in the center of which is a green stone. It is clearly an emerald. Any jewelers or dwarves in the group begin to drool immediately. Its value is easily over 25,000 g.p. ! It is also, for those parties that can check this out, fairly reeking of magic.
> 
> After the usual chattering about who will have the dubious honor of stealing the necklace some member of the party will eventually attempt to do so. This, of course is when the fun begins.
> 
> I, for one, think Evinrood is being far too generous with great loot at this point, but what the hey, maybe a few baubles keeps the party motivated to march to thier doom.
> 
> The tomb robber who plucks free the necklace will notice there is a slight resistance to this. A small wire is fastened to the amulet itself, and leads into the base of the alcove. If the would-be thief inspects the base, even carefully, the chances are very, very slim of his noticing the single wire. This is due to the fact that the gold necklace is made up of hundreds of loose wires unbraided or bundled, so there are dozens of them that mingle with the one key wire. (In the spirit of fairness, -ptooee! There is a 10% chance (L9) that the wire MIGHT be detected. Fairness, -gag- who ever thought I'd be saying that, must be getting soft ... )
> 
> The wire releases a trap which will be set in motion slowly enough that if the necklace thief wishes to put the necklace on he may.
> 
> If the necklace is not put on this in the net result. There is a momentary pause then the center portion of the vaulted ceiling plummets earthward. This event is followed almost immediately by the triangular sections, which are hinged at their bases, swinging downward, releasing the contents of the ceiling upon the party below. The room is 50 feet taller than the ceiling and filled with loose rocks, gravel and dust. This will crash down on the delvers, suffocating those is does not crush outright! Those near the door (within 10 feet) have a 70% chance (L3) to escape back into the hall. If there are members 20 feet from the door, they have a 50% chance (L5) of making the door, if they act fast! Those who are 30 feet from the door, (this includes the delver holding the necklace,) only have a 20% chance (L8) to make the door. 
> When the dust settles the door to the room will be entirely filled with sifting rubble from top to bottom, packed solid with exception of slightly settling dust grains. 
> 
> Now if the necklace thief wishes to don the purloined item the following events occur. First, the delver immediately bursts into an errie green flame, which suffuses his entire being. He will not feel a thing, and will sense no different, at the onset. The rest of the party will be momentarily distracted. Then the ceiling will fall in! The chances will be 10% worse because the party will be less alert. (60% (L4) form up to 10 feet, 40% (L6) from up to 20 feet, and finally 10% (L9) from 21 to 30 feet away.)
> 
> The delver translated into a Human Elemental will have a slightly higher chance of escaping, as he is not distracted, and is already pointed in the right direction. (His odds are the same as the startled party members at 20 feet from the door, 40% (L6))
> 
> If the character altered by the necklace is not trapped, and subsequently smothered by the avalance. He will find himself uniquely altered. He will find the amulet is now part of his chest. If it is removed the delver's body will be consumed by the emelental flame, but the enchanted stone will remain. This stone was a failed experiment by Evinrood to create an army of intelligent Elementals, the standard kind being very wild and hard to control due to their limited intelligence and, well, Elemental nature. The experiement was a failure because the "Human Elemental" created by the amulet while the powerful was independently intelligent and thus innately uncontrollable. (Just like real people. Oh gee, what a surprise!)
> 
> \[This is a player's note: The Elemental is burning: this will work well as a torch, but don't slap him on the back after a victory! Take the character's attributes and add them up into a total. This is the Elemental's base attribute for any numbered attribute, except Intelligence, and Luck for those games that have those attributes. He cannot use any weapon, save perhaps those enchanted ones that happen to be indestructable, assuming the party possesses one. The attribute total divided by 20 is the number of `dice: D6` flame based attack the player may generate. This cannot be projected further than 10 feet, but may be manifested as a "sword of fire" that juts from the player's first. This may seem to be make the player very tough, but there are some notorious disadvantages. The Elemental will take 10 times the damage from a water, ice or steam based attack. He cannot be attacked by conventional weapons, and takes 2 times damage from any enchanted weapons used against him. If the character is buried entirely in the ground he will die. If he is trapped in a closed room he will use up the available air 10 times as fast as a normal man. Finally if he is immersed in water, even for an instant the result will be a steam explosion equal to ten times the number of dice his attack can generate that will annihilate the character.]
> 
> The Avalanche is a four skull trap, but I still think the amulet is too much loot. If the curcumstances permit, you can swap some other nice shiny bauble and the delvers will never be wiser. 
> 
> The only exit to this room is back into the Thresherm and from there to either the Wall of Spears room, or the door to the right of the Amulet room. Whicever door the party did not enter through will still be covered with stucco.
