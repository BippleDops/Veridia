## Overview

The Memory Storm Fields represent one of Aquabyssos's most mysterious and dangerous phenomena: vast regions where accumulated memories from millions of beings crystallize into reality-warping weather patterns. These temporal storms manifest as swirling maelstroms of liquid memory that can trap travelers in recursive loops of past events, force them to experience life[Time]]s of foreign memories, or completely rewrite their personal history. Unlike normal weather, Memory Storms respond to consciousness itselfâ€”becoming more intense and dangerous when they encounter minds full of strong memories or emotional trauma.
