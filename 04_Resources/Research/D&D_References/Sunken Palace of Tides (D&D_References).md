Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. Additionally, ## Lore Details Legends speak of Sunken Palace of Tides as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Sunken Palace of Tides. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology.
