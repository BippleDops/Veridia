## Overview
**Level**: *1st-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (10 feet radius)

## Effects
While this spell is active, any words you or anyone within ten feet of you magically appear on a blank piece of paper in the language in which they were spoken. Spells with verbal components that are cast during that time cannot be recorded; the spell will continue but simply skip the time when the spell was cast or record a row of asterisks. Command words for magical items, however, *can* be recorded.
