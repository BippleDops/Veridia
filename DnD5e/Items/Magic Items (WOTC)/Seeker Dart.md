# Seeker Dart

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Dart

**Rarity:** uncommon

**Weight**: 0.25 lbs.

**Damage:** 1d4 piercing

## Description

This small dart is decorated with designs like windy spirals that span the length of its shaft.

When you whisper the word "seek" and hurl this dart, it seeks out a target of your choice within 120 feet of you. You must have seen the target before, but you don't need to see it now. If the target isn't within range or if there is no clear path to it, the dart falls to the ground, its magic spent and wasted. Otherwise, elemental winds guide the dart instantly through the air to the target. The dart can pass though openings as narrow as 1 inch wide and can change direction to fly around corners.

When the dart reaches its target, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take `dice: 1d4` piercing damage and `dice: 3d4` lightning damage. The dart's magic is then spent, and it becomes an ordinary dart.

**Finesse.** When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

**Thrown.** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.
