# Empathy (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *cantrip*

**School**: *Divination*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You look at one target within range and learn that the target is feeling one of the following emotions: anger, anticipation, anxiety, curiosity, desire, disgust, distress, fatigue, happiness, hatred, hostility, horror, hunger/thirst, love, lust, fear, need, optimism, pain, panic, pleasure, shame/guilt, sorrow, surprise, torment, uneasiness, or wonder, and whether it is a weak, moderate, or strong emotion. This does not reveal the source of the emotion or any other information about it. Only one emotion (the most prominent one the target is experiencing) per casting of the spell is revealed.

A creature that is aware that you are or might be attempting to contact its mind may attempt to make an Intelligence saving throw to resist; otherwise, there is no saving throw. Only humanoids, giants, beasts, monstrosities, and dragons with an Intelligence of 2 or higher can be affected with this spell.
