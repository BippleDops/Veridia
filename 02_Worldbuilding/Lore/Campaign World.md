# Campaign World

*"Two realms, one destiny - where surface dreams meet depths of reality."*

## Overview

The campaign world consists of two interconnected yet fundamentally different realms: Aethermoor, the surface world of sky-touching cities and wind-swept plains, and Aquabyssos, the underwater domain of pressure-forged architecture and current-carved caverns. These realms exist in a delicate balance, connected by magical portals, political intrigue, and the shared fate of their inhabitants who must navigate an increasingly complex relationship between surface and sea.

What makes this world unique is not just the dual-realm nature, but the active, ongoing interaction between the two domains. Unlike typical fantasy settings where different planes remain largely separate, Aethermoor and Aquabyssos are intimately connected through trade, diplomacy, conflict, and the mysterious forces that threaten both realms simultaneously.

## Historical Background

The two realms originally existed as separate dimensions until a cataclysmic magical event known as the Great Convergence caused their barriers to weaken and overlap. This event, occurring approximately 800 years ago, was initially seen as a disaster as it caused massive environmental upheavals in both worlds. However, over time, the connection proved beneficial, leading to unprecedented magical and technological advancement.

The early period following convergence was marked by confusion, conflict, and gradual understanding. Surface dwellers discovered they were not alone, while underwater civilizations learned of a vast world above their oceanic domain. The establishment of formal diplomatic relations took centuries, with both realms learning to navigate the complex challenges of inter-dimensional politics.

## Current State

The campaign world currently faces an era of unprecedented challenge and opportunity. Political tensions between various factions in both realms create a complex web of alliances and conflicts. Meanwhile, mysterious phenomena - including corruption effects, dimensional instabilities, and the awakening of ancient powers - threaten the stability of both domains.

Characters find themselves at the center of these converging crises, with their actions potentially determining the fate of both realms. The world is rich with adventure opportunities, from diplomatic missions and exploration to combat encounters and mystery-solving.

## Cultural Impact

### Aquabyssos
The underwater realm has developed a sophisticated society adapted to three-dimensional living and the constant presence of pressure and current. Politics flow like water, with power structures that can shift rapidly. Magic tends to be fluid and adaptive, reflecting the oceanic environment. Architecture and art emphasize organic curves and pressure-resistant design.

### Aethermoor
The surface world maintains more traditional fantasy elements but has been transformed by contact with Aquabyssos. Cities now incorporate water-management systems learned from underwater engineers, while magical practices blend surface and aquatic traditions. Society tends to be more structured and hierarchical than its underwater counterpart.

## Mechanics

### Requirements
- Understanding of dual-realm politics and culture
- Adaptation to environmental challenges of both domains

## Mysteries

- The true cause of the Great Convergence and whether it was intentional
- Ancient prophecies speaking of threats to both realms simultaneously
- The source of the corruption effects spreading through both domains
- Hidden connections between the realms that predate the Convergence

## Adventure Hooks

1. **Realm Stabilization**: Characters work to prevent dimensional barriers from collapsing completely
2. **Cultural Ambassador**: Serve as diplomatic representatives facilitating peace between factions
3. **Ancient Secrets**: Investigate ruins and artifacts that predate the Convergence

## Secrets (DM Only)

The Great Convergence was actually triggered by an ancient entity attempting to merge all possible worlds into one reality under its control. This entity remains dormant but is slowly awakening, and the increasing instabilities in both realms are signs of its growing influence.

## Player-Facing Summary

Campaign World is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Campaign World as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Campaign World.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
