# Storage Items
## Overview
Among my favorite quotes from Elminster the Sage is, “The reason that humans do not graze is that we have barrels.” Indeed, without our plethora of containers of all types, the word stockpile would have no significance to us. But no. We are the storers, the savers, the carriers, the keepers. We have different containers for eggs, wine, [[Jewelry|jewelry]], water, pottery, clothes, dead bodies, babies— all of which you will find in the following list.
