# Corpse Host (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 week


## Effects
You or one person you touch may transfer your soul to temporarily animate a fresh humanoid corpse (dead for less than 1 day). The corpse will not decay during this time, but will still look recently dead.

While in the corpse, you may move and act through it, and you can use your class abilities normally. You retain your Intelli-gence, Wisdom, and Charisma but you have the Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity of the host’s, as well as its original hit points. You use the corpse’s senses as your own. Your own body is paralyzed and does not need to eat or drink, and must remain within 5 miles of your host body. However, you are still linked to your body, and you may use your action to transfer your senses to your original body.

If your host body drops to 0 hit points for whatever reason, or the link between your host body and your real body is abruptly severed (such as by a *dispel magic* or *antimagic field*), you must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the shock of the destruction of the link was too great your own body immediately drops to 0 hit points as well. You may choose to end the link be-tween the two at any time and return to your own body without harm.
