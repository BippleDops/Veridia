# His Eternal Majesty, Keeper of the Throne of Bubbles
*The Suspended Emperor, He Who Breathes Water, The Eternal Sovereign of Depths*

## Overview
The Throne of Bubbles is both a person and an institution—the ancient ruler who has literally become one with their seat of power. For over four centuries, this sovereign has ruled [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Abyssos Prime]] from within a massive throne made of living coral and perpetual bubble streams. The current occupant, whose original name has been forgotten by all but themselves, exists in a state of suspended animation, breathing both air and water simultaneously while making pronouncements that ripple through the currents of political power.

The Throne itself is a marvel of ancient magic—a living coral structure that continuously generates streams of luminescent bubbles carrying the sovereign's consciousness throughout the underwater realm. The ruler's body has partially merged with the throne over centuries, making it unclear where the person ends and the seat of power begins.
