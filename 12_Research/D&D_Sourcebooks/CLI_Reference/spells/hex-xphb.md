# Hex
*1st-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (the petrified eye of a newt)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You place a curse on a creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra `d6` Necrotic damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack roll. Also, choose one ability when you cast the spell. The target has [[disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on ability checks made with the chosen ability.

If the target drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] before this spell ends, you can take a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] on a later turn to curse a new creature.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Your [[conditions#Concentration|Concentration]] can last longer with a spell slot of level 2 (up to 4 hours), 3-4 (up to 8 hours), or 5+ (24 hours).

**Classes**: [[list-spells-classes-warlock|Warlock]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-great-old-one-patron-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Warlock (Great Old One Patron)]]
