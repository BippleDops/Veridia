*Explosive* - **Cost**: 50 gp
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs. As an action, you can either throw a grenade at a point up to 60 feet away or use a Grenade Launcher to propel the grenade to a point up to 1,000 feet away. The grenade explodes at that point, creating a particular effect in a 20-foot-radius [[Area of Effect Xphb. The area of the [Area of Effect Xphb]] is [[Heavily Obscured Xphb by smoke for 1 minute. A strong wind (such as the [Gust of Wind Xphb]] spell) disperses the smoke. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 73* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Smoke grenade xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
