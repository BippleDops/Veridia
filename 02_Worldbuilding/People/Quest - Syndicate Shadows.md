![[04_Resources/Assets/04_Resources/Assets/Art/NPCs/Quest_-_Syndicate_Shadows.png|Quest - Syndicate Shadows Portrait]]

- Contingency: Keeps a sealed route toward [[The Whispering Expanse]] if negotiations sour.

## For the Table (Use Now)
- Opening Line: “Prices rise with fear; calm your breath and we can afford the truth.”
- Quick Offers: passage papers, rumor bundles, bonded cargo, introductions to a discreet artificer.
- Failure Still Progresses: Even when rebuffed, Quest - Syndicate Shadows sends a warning of a raid that creates a time-sensitive window.
