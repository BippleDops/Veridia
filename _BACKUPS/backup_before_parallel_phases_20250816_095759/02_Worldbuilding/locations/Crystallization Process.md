## Overview
The specialized magical and scientific process used in Aquabyssos to create various types of crystals for industrial, magical, and decorative purposes. This complex procedure combines natural pressure, magical energy, and precise timing to produce crystals with specific properties.

The process is essential to the city's economy and magical infrastructure, providing everything from basic lighting to advanced magical components.

## Basic Crystallization Method
**Stage 1 - Preparation**: Raw materials sorted and purified
**Stage 2 - Pressure Application**: Materials placed in high-pressure chambers
**Stage 3 - Magical Infusion**: Specific spells cast to guide crystal growth
**Stage 4 - Time Maturation**: Crystals develop over days to months
**Stage 5 - Harvesting**: Careful extraction without damaging crystal structure
**Stage 6 - Finishing**: Cutting, polishing, and quality testing

## Types of Crystals Produced
**Power Crystals**: Store and channel magical energy
**Light Crystals**: Provide illumination for buildings and streets
**Communication Crystals**: Enable long-distance messaging
**Pressure Crystals**: Regulate water pressure in city systems
**Defense Crystals**: Used in magical shields and protective wards
**Memory Crystals**: Store information and experiences

## Raw Materials
**Deep Sea Minerals**: Rare substances found only at extreme depths
**Magical Reagents**: Powdered gems, essence oils, arcane salts
**Organic Components**: Certain deep-sea creature shells and bones
**Alchemical Catalysts**: Compounds that accelerate crystal formation
**Pure Water**: Specially filtered and magically treated liquid

## Equipment Required
**Pressure Chambers**: Reinforced vessels simulating deep ocean conditions
**Magical Focusing Arrays**: Devices that direct and amplify spellcasting
**Temperature Controls**: Systems maintaining precise heat levels
**Time Dilation Fields**: Magic that speeds or slows crystal growth
**Extraction Tools**: Specialized implements for removing finished crystals

## Pressure Chamber Operations
**Standard Pressure**: 1,000-5,000 PSI for basic crystals
**High Pressure**: 10,000-25,000 PSI for advanced crystals
**Extreme Pressure**: 50,000+ PSI for legendary quality crystals
**Pressure Cycling**: Alternating pressures to create specific structures
**Emergency Release**: Safety systems preventing chamber explosions

## Magical Infusion Techniques
**Elemental Channeling**: Infusing crystals with elemental properties
**Spell Binding**: Storing specific spells within crystal matrix
**Energy Focusing**: Concentrating magical power for later release
**Property Enhancement**: Improving natural crystal characteristics
**Custom Enchantments**: Creating crystals with unique magical effects

## Timing and Growth Rates
**Basic Crystals**: 3-7 days for simple light or power crystals
**Advanced Crystals**: 2-4 weeks for communication or defense crystals
**Master Crystals**: 3-6 months for high-end magical components
**Legendary Crystals**: 1+ years for artifacts and special items
**Rush Jobs**: Accelerated process with lower quality results

## Quality Control
**Visual Inspection**: Checking for cracks, cloudiness, or color variations
**Magical Testing**: Verifying enchantments and power storage capacity
**Stress Testing**: Ensuring crystals can handle intended applications
**Resoce Analysis**: Testing vibration and frequency characteristics
**Safety Certification**: Confirming crystals won't cause harmful effects
