*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 224, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 233* The Shadowfell turns visitors around until they become marooned in its twisted landscape. Lost sorrowswornâ€”often referred to as the Lostâ€”are representations of the anxiety and fear people experience when they can't find their way. These sorrowsworn appear desperate and panicked. Lost sorrowsworn grasp at any creatures they can reach. A victim experiences a flood of fear and panic as its mind buckles under the fury of this assault. The harder a victim's allies fight to break the grasp, the more the victim suffers. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Sorrowsworn The Shadowfell's pervasive melancholy sometimes gives rise to strange incarnations of the plane's bleak nature.
