# Rising Rot (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level necromantic*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a handful of mold spores)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You hold up your hand a thin beam of sickly green-brown light shoots out and strikes one living, corporeal creature within range you can see. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw each round. The creature takes 1d8 poison damage and 1d8 necrotic damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one. These effects continue until the target has successfully save three times, although they do not have to be consecutive.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell with a 7th-level or higher spell slot, it inflicts 2d8 poison damage and 2d8 necrotic damage each round.
