## Special Traits
**Spell-like Abilities:** Thalasskoptis can use the following spell-like abilities, using Charisma as its casting ability (DC 16, attack +8). Thalasskoptis doesn’t need material components to use these abilities.

- At Will: *animate dead, charm person, clairvoyance, darkness, detect thoughts, dispel magic, fear, suggestion, teleport*

- 3/Day: *dominate monster*

**Toxic Ink (3/Day):** Thalasskoptis can squirt a cloud of poisonous ink into air or water. The ink creates a sphere 60 feet in radius centered on Thalasskoptis, and it lasts for one minute. The cloud is stationary; it doesn't move with Thalasskoptis. The area inside the cloud is heavily obscured. Creatures other than Thalasskoptis in the ink cloud must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw against poison or be stunned for as long as they remain inside the ink cloud.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** Thalasskoptis attacks four times with tentacles, or it attacks twice with tentacles and either uses one spelllike ability or emits a toxic ink cloud.

**Tentacles:** *Melee Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (`dice: 2d10+4`) bludgeoning damage. If the target of this attack is a stunned creature, the attack is automatically a critical hit.

## Legendary Actions
**Bite:** +8 to hit, one creature grappled by Thalasskoptis. Hit: 11 (`dice: 2d6+4`) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for `dice: 1d6` rounds and take 9 (`dice: 2d8`) poison damage.

**Spell-Like Ability:** Thalasskoptis uses one at-will spell-like ability.

**Tentacle Grab:** Thalasskoptis makes one tentacle attack. If this attack hits, the target is also grappled.

## Description
Thalasskoptis is a mass of writhing tentacles with a feral but boyish face at the center. It is the lord of underwater corruption, of those who die at sea, and of many horrific beasts of the dark, oceanic deeps. It is an occasional rival of Orcus, who considers his domain to include all death, without exceptions for death at sea. The two demons have many overlapping interests, however, so they are allies more often than enemies in the grim power struggles of the Abyss. Some of Thalasskoptis’s enemies dismiss this demon as an underwater minion of Orcus—a claim that incurs a terrible vengeance from the sea-demon, if it hears such talk.

The lair of Thalasskoptis is a sprawling palace of coral that stretches for miles across the sea floor and extends into deep subterranean tunnels beneath the sea floor of the Abyss. It can sometimes be located by the mass of rotting, bloated bodies of humanoids, whales, fish, sea monsters, and seaweed that slowly revolves on the surface of the sea above the lair. In its lair, Thalasskoptis spends much of its time slumbering at the heart of a 300-foot-diamater sphere of corpses bound together by seaweed. While it slumbers, the demon is guarded by giant sharks, aquatic ghouls, sea serpents, and possibly even an undead kraken.

Thalasskoptis has scattered followings of human cultists in the Material Plane, predominantly in coastal communities. It is served in the deep oceans of the Material Plane by [[Dark Triton|dark tritons]]. From time to time, dark ships of drowned, undead sailors rise from the sea to pillage treasure from coastal cities and transport it back to their dread lord’s realm. Although they appear very rarely—seldom more than once in a single human lifetime—the visits of these ships are so feared that Thalasskoptis’s cultists are allowed to quietly practice their dark rites lest the dread sea lord seek vengeance for them. When the dark fleets rise from the water, reeking of salt and rot, miles of coastline can be purged of life, the inhabitants dragged beneath the waves to serve the master they did not fear sufficiently.
