# Adventure Background

The Verduran Forest is the largest woodland in Avistan. Despite the fact that it sprawls across some of the oldest and most powerful nations in the Inner Sea region, the druids, fey, and other residents of the wilderness have always resisted incursions from nearby civilizations. In nations like Andoran, this resistance has often led to violence, as Wildwood druids, protective fey, and local centaurs clash with exploitive logging companies. Yet not all relationships proved so antagonistic; in Taldor, the empire still holds to the Wildwood Treaty it signed in 3841 ar, which grants the forest legal protections and limits the amount of resources locals could take in any given year.

Of course, not every citizen respects the laws of their nations, and selfish or desperate individuals often attempt to skirt Taldor’s regulations. The latest of these infractions occurred when a Taldan noblewoman named Lady Constance Meliosa encountered a peculiar creature on one of her luxury camping expeditions—a tiny plant animated by a nature spirit, known as a leshy. Constance immediately fell in love with the creature and captured them, taking them to her manor to display to all her noble friends. Since the poor leshy couldn’t speak, the nobles interpreted their frantic attempts to escape as nothing more than adorable antics. To Lady Constance and her fellow aristocrats, the leshy was little more than a pet to be brought out on display.

It wouldn’t be long before Constance decided that a single leshy wasn’t enough—she needed more leshys to decorate her abode. Though she learned how to make her own leshys, the ones from Verduran Forest proved more popular with the local ladies, and so Constance made arrangements with a shady business contact. A week later, a crate of abducted, smuggled leshys arrived at the manor, and Constance set about arranging the imprisoned plants, unaware and uncaring that the forest had its own protectors.
