*"They cut away pain by removing the ability to feel anything at all."*

## Overview
The Nightmare Surgeons are a rogue medical organization that uses extreme and often horrific surgical procedures to "cure" patients of various ailments.

They justify their brutal techniques as necessary for true healing, creating a following among the desperate.
