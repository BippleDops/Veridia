# Potion of Climbing
*Potion, common*  


- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, you gain a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/climb-speed-xphb|Climb Speed]] equal to your [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb|Speed]] for 1 hour. During this time, you have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on Strength ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) checks to climb.

This potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.
