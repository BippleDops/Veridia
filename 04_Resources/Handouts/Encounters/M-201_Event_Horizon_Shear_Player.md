# Event Horizon Shear

A black ring cuts across the sky like a halo with teeth. Lines on the deck don’t meet.

What you notice
- Rigging shadows out of step
- A tug sideways where nothing is

What you can try
- Keep the anchor hymn steady
- Move slowly; call your steps

Possible outcomes
- You pass cleanly
- A spar tears away into silence
- The ship lurches and someone falls
