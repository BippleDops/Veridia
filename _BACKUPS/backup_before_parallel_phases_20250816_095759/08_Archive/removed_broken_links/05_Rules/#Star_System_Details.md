**Purpose**: Enhance gameplay in spe
*Sounds of [relevant sounds] echo in the distance.*cific situations ### Basic Resolution

The fundamental process works as follows: 1. **Trigger**: Specific situation arises requiring this mechanic
2. **Setup**: Establish parameters and stakes
3. **Action**: Players make choices using the system
4. **Resolution**: Determine outcomes based on rolls and decisions
5. Nevertheless, **Consequences**: Apply results to ongoing game ### Prerequisites

Before using this mechanic:
- Specific conditions must be met
- Players must have certain capabilities
- DM establishes parameters #### Step 1: Initiation

Determine when and how the mechanic activates:
- Player-triggered vs. DM-triggered

3. Make necessary rolls
4. Apply modifiers and advantages
5. Compare to target numbers #### Step 3: Results

Determining success and degree:
- **Critical Success** (20 or beat DC by 10+): Exceptional outcome
- **Success** (Meet or beat DC): Intended result achieved
- **Partial Success** (Fail by 5 or less): Limited success with complication
- **Failure** (Fail by 6+): Intended result not achieved
- **Critical Failure** (1 or fail by 10+): Significant negative consequence ### Example 1: Basic Use

*Scenario*: [Specific situation]
- Player declares intent
- DM sets **DC 15**
- Player rolls d20+5, gets 17
- Success achieved with described outcome ### Example 2: Complex Application

*Scenario*: [More complex situation]
- Multiple participants involved
- Extended challenge requiring multiple rolls
- Resource management element
- Partial successes building to completion ### Example 3: Failed Attempt

*Scenario*: [Failure situation]
- What went wrong
- Consequences of failure
- Recovery options
- Learning from failure ### With Combat

How this mechanic works during combat:
- Action/bonus action/reaction cost
- Interaction with initiative
- Effects on combat dynamics ### With Exploration

Application during exploration:
- Time requirements
- Resource consumption
- Discovery opportunities
- Environmental interactions ### With Social Encounters

Elena tries to jump while carrying an unconscious ally in heavy rain. DC increases to 15, disadvantage, and STR check to not drop ally. ## Balance Analysis ### Damage Output Comparison

- Standard Fighter: `dice: 2d6`+5 (avg 12)
