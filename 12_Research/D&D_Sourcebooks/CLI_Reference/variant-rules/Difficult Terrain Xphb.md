# Difficult Terrain
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 366. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* 

If a space is Difficult Terrain, every foot of movement in that space costs 1 extra foot. For example, moving 5 feet through Difficult Terrain costs 10 feet of movement. Difficult Terrain isn't cumulative; either a space is Difficult Terrain or it isn't.

A space is Difficult Terrain if the space contains any of the following or something similar:

- A creature that isn't Tiny or your ally  
- Furniture that is sized for creatures of your size or larger  
- Heavy snow, ice, rubble, or undergrowth  
- Liquid that's between shin- and waist-deep  
- A narrow opening sized for a creature one size smaller than you  
- A slope of 20 degrees or more
