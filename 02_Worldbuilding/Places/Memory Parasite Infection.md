## Overview
A dangerous outbreak of memory parasites threatens Aquabyssos as microscopic creatures feed on stored memories, leaving victims with gaps in their recollections and altered personalities. The infection spreads through contact with contaminated water sources.

The parasites are not native to local waters, suggesting either artificial introduction or environmental changes allowing their spread from deeper ocean regions.

## The Parasites
**Scientific Name**: Mnemonic Aquaticus
**Size**: Microscopic, requiring magical detection to observe
**Behavior**: Attach to neural tissue, consume memory engrams
**Lifespan**: 30-60 days if untreated
**Transmission**: Contaminated water, direct neural contact
**Symptoms**: Progressive memory loss, personality changes, confusion

## Infection Stages
**Stage 1 (Days 1-5)**: Minor forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating
**Stage 2 (Days 6-15)**: Significant memory gaps, mood swings
**Stage 3 (Days 16-30)**: Major personality changes, loss of important memories
**Stage 4 (Days 31+)**: Complete memory erasure, catatonic state
**Terminal**: Death from inability to remember basic survival functions

## Current Outbreak Status
**Confirmed Cases**: 147 individuals across four districts
**Suspected Cases**: 300+ people showing early symptoms
**Deaths**: 12 individuals who reached terminal stage
**Quarantine Zones**: Three water treatment facilities shut down
**Public Response**: Growing panic and demand for government action

## Affected Areas
**Harbor District**: Highest concentration due to water contamination
**Lower Residential**: Poor water filtration systems
**Market Quarter**: Spread through public fountains and baths
**Noble District**: Limited cases due to private water sources
**Industrial Zone**: Workers exposed through cooling systems

## Medical Response
**Chief Medical Officer**: Dr. Coral Mindhealer leading response effort
**Treatment Centers**: Five facilities established for patient care
**Research Teams**: Multiple groups working on cure development
**Quarantine Protocols**: Isolation procedures for confirmed cases
**Public Health Measures**: Water restrictions and testing programs

## Treatment Options
**Magical Healing**: High-level magic can remove parasites but not restore memories
**Alchemical Solutions**: Experimental treatments showing promise
**Memory Reconstruction**: Magical attempts to rebuild lost memories
**Supportive Care**: Managing symptoms while seeking cure
**Preventive Measures**: Water purification and protection spells

## Investigation Leads
**Water Sources**: Tracing contamination to identify origin point
**Environmental Changes**: Recent disturbances that might explain outbreak
**Foreign Introduction**: Possibility of deliberate biological warfare
**Deep Ocean Connection**: Parasites may originate from unexplored depths
**Archaeological Sites**: Ancient disturbances releasing dormant parasites

## Government Response
**Emergency Funding**: 100,000 gold allocated for medical research
**Water Safety**: Mandatory testing and purification of all sources
**Public Information**: Daily briefings on infection status and prevention
**Research Grants**: Ficial incentives for cure development
**International Aid**: Requesting assistance from surface world medical experts

## Potential Solutions
**Water Treatment**: Advanced purification systems to eliminate parasites
**Magical Barriers**: Protective wards around water sources
**Biological Control**: Finding natural predators of memory parasites
**Environmental Restoration**: Addressing root causes of outbreak
**Memory Banking**: Storing memories before infection occurs

## Adventure Hooks
1. Characters hired to investigate outbreak source
2. Party member becomes infected, needs urgent treatment
3. Research expedition to deep ocean parasite origin
4. Political intrigue involving biological warfare accusations

## Key NPCs
**Dr. Coral Mindhealer**: Chief medical researcher seeking cure
**Patient Zero**: First known case, may hold clues to source
**Minister of Health**: Government official coordinating response
**The Forgotten**: Support group for families of infected
**Deep Explorer**: Witness to possible parasite origin

## Long-term Consequences
**Successful Response**: Medical advances, improved water systems
**Partial Success**: Ongoing endemic infection with managed symptoms
**Failure**: Mass casualties, social collapse, abandonment of affected areas
**Prevention**: Enhanced surveillance and response systems
**Research Benefits**: Medical knowledge applicable to other threats

### Key Locations
1. Main entrance/approach
2. Central gathering area
3. Important buildings/features
4. Defensive positions (if applicable)
5. Hidden or secret areas

## DM Notes
This outbreak provides opportunities for medical mysteries, social drama, and moral dilemmas about identity and memory. Consider how the infection affects NPCs players know, and whether memory loss is always purely negative.
