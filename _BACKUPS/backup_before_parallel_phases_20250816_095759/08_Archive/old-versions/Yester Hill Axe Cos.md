*Weapon ([[Battleaxe Xphb)* - **Damage**: - One-handed: `dice: 1d8` slashing - Two-handed: `dice: 1d10` slashing
- **Properties**: [item properties#Versatile|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs. The axe's handle is carved with leaves and vines, and it weighs half as much as a normal battleaxe. When the axe hits a plant, whether an ordinary plant or a plant creature, the target takes an extra`d8`slashing damage. When a creature of non-good alignment wields the axe, it sprouts thorns whenever its wielder makes an attack with it. These thorns prick the wielder for 1 piercing damage after the attack is made, and this damage is considered magical. *Source: Curse of Strahd p. 198* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Yester hill axe cos is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
