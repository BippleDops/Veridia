--- # Healer

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 201* You gain the following benefits. **Battle Medic.** If you have a Healer's Kit, you can expend one use of it and tend to a creature within 5 feet of yourself as a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action. That creature can expend one of its Hit Point Dice, and you then roll that die. The creature regains a number of Hit Points equal to the roll plus your Proficiency Bonus. **Healing Rerolls.** Whenever you roll a die to determine the number of Hit Points you restore with a spell or with this feat's Battle Medic benefit, you can reroll the die if it rolls a 1, and you must use the new roll. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Healer xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
