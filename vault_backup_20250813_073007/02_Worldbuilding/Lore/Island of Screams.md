## Lore Details

Legends speak of Island of Screams as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Island of Screams.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Island of Screams to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
