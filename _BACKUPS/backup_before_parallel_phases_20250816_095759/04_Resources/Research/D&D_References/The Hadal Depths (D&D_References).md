The Hadal Depths represent the absolute bottom of [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos, where water becomes something else entirely and the laws of physics surrender to older truths. Here, at depths exceeding 20,000 feet, the [Deep Mother|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/Deep Mother]] slumbers in her eternal dream, her massive form comprising entire mountain ranges and trenches. This is where existence becomes negotiable, where pressure transforms matter into thought, and where even [[Aboleth Prime Yoth|02 Worldbuilding/People/Aboleth Prime Yoth]] fears to venture. #### The Hadal Threshold (20,000-25,000 feet)

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Hadal Depths as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around The Hadal Depths. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Second Prophecy of Depths ## Plot Hooks - Someone is protecting a artifact for love

- A map reveals the truth about the government
- Strange disappearances suggest a conspiracy ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
