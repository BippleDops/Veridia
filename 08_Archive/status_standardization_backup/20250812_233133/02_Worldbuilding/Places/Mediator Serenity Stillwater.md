## Secrets and Hidden Aspects

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Empathic Resonance
> The Stillwater Mediation Hall is built around a naturally occurring phenomenon where the water itself absorbs and reflects emotional states. [[Serenity Stillwater]] discovered this property decades ago and has been carefully cultivating it, creating an environment where participants literally feel each other's emotions through the water. This empathic resonance is the real secret behind the Hall's extraordinary success rate, but Serenity fears that revealing this would make people feel manipulated rather than genuinely reconciled.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Broken Mediator
> [[Serenity Stillwater]] carries a terrible secret: she has never been able to resolve her own deepest conflict with her estranged sister, despite being the most skilled mediator in the world. Her sister was wrongfully exiled years ago due to a misunderstanding that Serenity was partly responsible for, and every attempt at reconciliation has failed. This unresolved pain drives her dedication to helping others find peace, but also represents her greatest vulnerability.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Memory Archive
> Hidden beneath the Hall is a secret chamber containing copies of memories from thousands of mediation sessions, preserved without the participants' knowledge. [[Keeper of Memories Echo Truthseer]] has been secretly collecting these memories, believing they represent valuable documentation of human conflict and resolution. However, this massive violation of privacy could destroy the Hall's reputation if discovered, and Echo struggles with the ethical implications of her actions while being unable to destroy what she sees as invaluable historical records.
