## Description
Nisps are a race of water-based fey creatures that dwell in oceans, seas, lakes, rivers, and occasionally swamps, provided they can find deep enough water there. They are aggressive hunters that dine on anything they can catch and kill. This fearsome creature is 9 feet tall, with light gray skin and a white underbelly. It has large, wicked talons and a frighteningly large mouth that is filled with daggerlike teeth.

Gray nisps dwell alone in deep water; caves on the ocean floor or hollows at the bottom of large lakes are where they usually hide their lairs. They are solitary and territorial, and they have a keen sense of smell while underwater.

Nisps do not reason the way most creatures do. They have no concepts of love, duty, or hatred, and they seem completely unsympathetic to the pain and suffering of others. While they seldom leave their watery homes or interact with creatures on land, tremendous curiosity drives them to investigate whenever creatures stray too close to their lairs. To satisfy their curiosity, nisps are more likely to pull intruders apart limb by limb to see how they are built than to ask questions—or they will ask their questions as they are pulling someone apart, and become annoyed when the person doesn’t answer clearly. They have enough intelligence to realize that most other humanoids are smarter than them, and this understanding also makes them irritable and unpredictable. Even other aquatic creatures such as kuo-toa and sahuagin tend to leave gray nisps alone, although sahuagin have been known to enlist their aid on rare occasions.

Gray nisps surprise intruders if they can. They are unpredictable in all things, including combat. They can be engaged in conversation if the stranger has something the gray nisp wants that can’t easily be snatched away. Sadly, their innate stupidity usually leads to increasing frustration, and finally a burst into violence. It is never wise to goad or even drift too close to a nisp that is showing signs of impatience.
