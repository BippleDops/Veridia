--- # Session 3: Council of Shadows > *"In politics, the deadliest shadows are cast by those claiming to bring light."* ## ðŸ”§ [[Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### [Connection Improvements]] - Add cross-references to related notes ### [[Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## ðŸŽ­ [Strong Start]]

The party is summoned to an emergency council, but arrives to find [[[Lord Aurelius Goldwave]] murdered in his study, his body partially crystallized. A [[Purist Coalition pin is clutched in his dead hand, but the crystal pattern suggests magical assassination. City guards are already trying to arrest a [Crimson Hand]] suspect. ### Scene 1: [[The Murder Scene

**Location**: [[[Goldwave Manor]]]] study
**Situation**: Investigating the lord's death before guards contaminate evidence
**Conflict**: Political pressure from multiple factions #### [[Investigation Clues

- Crystal pattern indicates inside-out crystallization (not plague)
- Purist pin was placed post-mortem (no grip marks)
- Hidden safe contains documents about plague origin
- Window lock broken from inside, not outside
- Traces of rare arcane component (only sold at [[[Shadow Bazaar]]]]) **[[Skill Challenges**:
- Investigation **DC 14**: Find hidden safe
- Medicine **DC 15**: Determine true cause of death
- Arcana **DC 13**: Identify magical assassination method
- Persuasion **DC 16**: Convince guards to delay arrest **Discovery**: [Lord Goldwave]] was about to reveal evidence about the plague's origin ### Scene 2: [[The Secret Council

**Location**: Hidden chamber beneath [Cathedral of Light]]
**Situation**: [[[High Inquisitor Maltheos]] chairs emergency faction meeting
**Conflict**: Accusations fly between all factions #### [[Faction Representatives

- **[Crimson Hand]]**: Defensive, claims frame-up
- **[[Purist Coalition**: Aggressive, demands magical purge
- **[Silverscale Consortium]]**: Nervous, preparing to flee
- **Order of the [[Celestial Dawn**: Trying to maintain peace **[Social Encounter]]**:
- Each faction makes accusations (Insight **DC 13** to detect lies)
- Party can influence proceedings (Persuasion/Intimidation)
- Success: Prevents faction war
- Failure: Immediate violence erupts **Discovery**: Each faction has lost members to mysterious disappearances ### Scene 3: [[The Queen's Representative

**Location**: [[[Royal Embassy]]]]
**Situation**: Anonymous royal agent "[[Silver Mask" provides classified information
**Conflict**: Information comes with dangerous conditions #### [The Deal]]

[[Silver Mask offers:
- Location of plague's first victim
- Royal seal to access restricted areas
- Warning about the [Crystal Festival]] [[The Price:
- Investigate without revealing royal involvement
- Report findings only to [Silver Mask]]
- Accept magical geas (Zone of Truth compulsion) **Discovery**: [[Queen Seraphina hasn't been seen publicly in two weeks ### Scene 4: [The Midnight]] Market

**Location**: [[[Shadow Bazaar]] (illegal magical market)
**Situation**: Following leads to crystal plague cure sellers
**Conflict**: Ambush by corrupted city watch #### [[Market Investigation

- Fake cure sellers (**DC 15** Insight to identify)
- Real seller who's terrified (needs protection)
- Information broker who knows about talismans
- Corrupted guards raid the market **Discovery**: Someone is distributing free "protection" talismans that actually spread corruption ## ðŸŽ¯ Secrets & Clues

1. [Lord Goldwave]] was selling information to multiple factions
2. The murder weapon was a crystalline dagger that dissolved after use
3. [[High Inquisitor Maltheos has been meeting secretly with someone at the docks
4. [The Queen]]'s last public appearance showed signs of crystal corruption
5. [[Brother Marcus has successfully reversed early-stage crystallization
6. [The Silverscale]] Consortium is preparing to evacuate the city
7. A ship arrived from the [[Forgotten Isles three days before the plague started
8. The talismans contain microscopic crystal fragments
9. Seven noble houses have identical locked vaults dated from 200 years ago
10. [The Cathedral]]'s foundation stones are actually ancient crystal formations ## ðŸŽ¬ [[Cliffhanger Ending

During the midnight market raid, [[[Brother Marcus]] Steelbane]] arrives frantically. He's made a breakthroughâ€”the plague isn't a disease, it's a transformation preparing hosts for something. As he explains, crystalline veins suddenly spread across his face. He gasps: "[[The Queen... At the [Crystal Festival]]... Seven shards unite... [[The Drowned God..." before collapsing into crystal stasis. [The Festival]] is in one week. ## ðŸŽ² [[Quick Adjustments

**[If Running]] Short on Time**: - Skip the midnight market
- [[Have Marcus arrive during council **[If Party]] [[Needs More Direction**:
- [Silver Mask]] provides more explicit guidance
- Marcus's notes contain clear next steps **[[If Combat [Is Desired]]**:
- Add faction fight during council
- Increase market raid difficulty > *Remember: This session shifts from investigation to revelation. The plague's true nature begins emerging, and political tensions reach breaking point.* ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*
