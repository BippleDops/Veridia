The Deepwatch Guard serves as Aquabyssos's most specialized military unit, trained specifically to combat shadow corruption, deep-sea aberrations, and threats that emerge from the darkest depths of the realm. Unlike the regular [[The Depth Wardens, who focus on general military defense, the Deepwatch Guard specializes in enemies that conventional forces cannot effectively engage—creatures of living shadow, manifestations of [The Deep Mother|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]]'s influence, and horrors that defy normal military tactics. They represent the last line of defense against threats that could corrupt or destroy civilization from within. #### Threat Assessment Protocol

1. **Initial Detection**: Automated sensors or reports trigger investigation
2. Therefore, **Rapid Response**: Beta Squadron conducts preliminary reconnaissance 3. **Threat Classification**: Determine appropriate response level and resources needed
4. **Force Deployment**: Deploy suitable combination of squadrons for mission
5. **Engagement**: Execute tactical plan with continuous adaptation
6. **Aftermath**: Containment, cleanup, and analysis of results ### Recruitment Campaign

**Level**: 3-7 **Hook**: Party recruited as potential Deepwatch candidates or civilian auxiliaries **Training**: Extended adventure involving learning anti-shadow combat techniques **Challenge**: Facing escalating shadow threats while developing necessary skills **Choice**: Decision to commit to Deepwatch service or remain independent allies **Development**: Character growth through specialized training and team bonding ### The Shadow Infiltration

**Level**: 8-12 **Hook**: Deepwatch base compromised by shadow entity infiltration **Investigation**: Discover how shadows bypassed extensive security measures **Mystery**: Uncover internal conspiracy or fundamental flaw in protection systems **Action**: Root out corruption while maintaining unit cohesion and effectiveness **Stakes**: Failure could result in loss of primary anti-shadow military capability ### The Deep Reconnaissance

**Level**: 10-15 **Hook**: Assigned to investigate mysterious deep-sea signals suggesting major shadow activity **Exploration**: Journey into unexplored regions with unknown dangers **Discovery**: Encounter evidence of [[The Deep Mother|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother's increasing influence **Challenge**: Survive long enough to report findings back to Deepwatch command **Consequence**: Information gathered determines preparation for coming crisis ### The Last Stand

**Level**: 15-20 **Hook**: Major shadow outbreak threatens to overrun entire region **Command**: Take leadership of Deepwatch operations during catastrophic crisis **Resources**: Coordinate all available forces and equipment in desperate defense **Sacrifice**: Make difficult decisions about acceptable losses and resource allocation **Epic**: Success or failure determines fate of thousands of civilians and future shadow resistance ## Player-Facing Summary The Deepwatch Guard is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
