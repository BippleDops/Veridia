## Description
A fire snake resembles a normal snake ranging from 2 feet to 6 feet in length, except for the dimly flickering flames visible inside its mouth and along its scales. Away from the Elemental Plane of Fire, fire snakes make their homes in fires and rarely journey more than 30 feet from an open flame. Sages conjecture that fire snakes might be some form of larval salamander.

A poisonous fire snake’s preferred method of attack is to hide in a fire and surprise foes as they come nearby. They will sometimes crawl into a campfire that no one is paying close attention to, and attack while people are cooking or relaxing around the fire, without their weapons and armor, or even wait until the campers build up the fire for the night and go to sleep before creeping out and striking.
