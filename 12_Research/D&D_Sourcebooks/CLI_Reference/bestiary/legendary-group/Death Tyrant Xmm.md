## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing a death tyrant's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Negative Energy Suffusion.** Whenever a creature within 1 mile of the lair regains [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] from a spell, it subtracts `d10` from the number of [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] regained.  
- **Scopophobia.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair feel as if they're being watched. Any creature (excluding the death tyrant and its allies) that finishes a [[short-rest-xphb]] while within 1 mile of the lair must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or gain no benefit from that rest.  

If the death tyrant dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

## Player-Facing Summary

Death tyrant xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of death tyrant xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around death tyrant xmm.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
