# Moonbeam
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a moonseed leaf)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [[cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]] centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, [[dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] fills the [[cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]], and you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action on later turns to move the [[cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]] up to 60 feet.

When the [[cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]] appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `2d10` Radiant damage, and if the creature is shape-shifted (as a result of the [[polymorph-xphb|Polymorph]] spell, for example), it reverts to its true form and can't shape-shift until it leaves the [[cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]]. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. A creature also makes this save when the spell's area moves into its space and when it enters the spell's area or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d10` for each spell slot level above 2.
