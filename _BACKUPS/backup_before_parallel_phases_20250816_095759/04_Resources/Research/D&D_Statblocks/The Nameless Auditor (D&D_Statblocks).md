*Master of Secrets, The Information Broker Supreme* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

The Nameless Auditor serves as the "Scale of Information" on the [[Silverscale Consortium|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/Silverscale Consortium's Board of Scales, controlling the organization's vast intelligence network and information-gathering operations. Their true identity, appearance, and even gender remain unknown—they appear differently to each person who meets them, and their name changes with each interaction. What remains constant is their supernatural ability to acquire, process, and weaponize information. ## Adventure Hooks

1. **The Information Hunt**: Seek specific knowledge from their archives
2. **The Double Agent**: Discover spy within party's organization
3. **The Blackmail Plot**: Help or oppose their leverage operations
4. **The Identity Crisis**: Investigate their true nature and origins

The target must make a **DC 20** Constitution save or lose those memories permanently while the Auditor gains access to them. **Information Network.** The Auditor can use an action to consult their network of spies, functioning as a *legend lore* spell with no casting time or material components (3/day). **Shapechanger.** The Auditor can use their action to polymorph into any humanoid form they've encountered, retaining their game statistics. **Spellcasting.** The Auditor is an 18th-level spellcaster. Spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save **DC 20**, +12 to hit). Known spells:

Target must succeed on **DC 20** Wisdom save or have their most recent memory stolen. **Revelation Strike (Recharge 5-6).** The Auditor whispers a devastating secret about the target. One creature within 60 feet must succeed on **DC 20** Wisdom save or take 35 (`dice: 10d6`) psychic damage and be stunned until end of their next turn. **Blackmail Command (1/Day).** The Auditor uses compromising information to control a target within 60 feet. Functions as *geas* spell (save **DC 20**) but lasts only 24 hours. ### Lair Actions (The Black Ledger Archive)

**The Chilling Effect:** Self-censorship, relationship difficulties, suppressed innovation, eroded social trust
**The Control Mechanism:** Behavior modification through fear, enforced conformity, managed competition, controlled social mobility ### The Dehumanization Process
