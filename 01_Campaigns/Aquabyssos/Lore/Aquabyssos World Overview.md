# Aquabyssos - The Drowned Realms

## Overview
Aquabyssos is a vast underwater realm formed from the catastrophic flooding of an entire continent over three centuries of interconnected climatic disasters known as [[The Great Drowning]]. What was once a thriving surface world of seven kingdoms now lies beneath miles of dark, magical waters where the descendants of survivors have adapted to an aquatic existence through desperate magic and darker pacts.

## The Central Mystery
The waters of Aquabyssos are not merely ocean - they are suffused with an ancient magical essence called [[The Cerulean Breath]], which allows air-breathers to survive underwater but slowly changes them over generations. The source of the Great Drowning remains contested, with three competing theories held by different factions:
- The [[Church of the Tidal Throne]] believes it was divine punishment
- The [[Abyssal Academy]] claims it was a magical experiment gone wrong
- The [[Order of the Sunken Crown]] maintains it was an intentional sacrifice to prevent something worse

## Major Regions

### The Twilight Reaches
The uppermost layer (0-500 feet), where filtered sunlight still penetrates. Home to [[New Tethys]], the largest city-state, built within the drowned spires of the old capital.

### The Gloom Gardens
(500-2000 feet) Bioluminescent kelp forests and coral cities. Contains [[Lumengarde]] and [[The Phosphor Markets]].

### The Midnight Expanse
(2000-5000 feet) The political heart of Aquabyssos, housing [[Pressure's End]] and the [[Bathyal Palace]].

### The Hadal Depths
(5000+ feet) The mysterious deep where [[The Trencher Folk]] dwell and where the [[Primordial Vaults]] supposedly lie.

### The Bubble Zones
Magical air pockets preserved around certain ancient sites, including [[Old Valdris]] and [[The Sunken Cathedral of Stars]].

## Current Political Climate
The realm is divided between:
- **The Tethyan Hegemony**: Controls trade and the upper reaches, led by [[Archon Meredith Saltweaver]]
- **The Depth Wardens**: Military control of the middle depths, commanded by [[Admiral Thorne Blackwater]]
- **The Coral Courts**: Ancient noble houses adapted to underwater life, headed by [[Duke Cyrus Reefheart]]
- **The Free Current**: Smugglers and rebels operating from [[The Wandering Atoll]]

## Magic in Aquabyssos
Magic is omnipresent but twisted by the aquatic environment:
- **Hydromancy**: The dominant school, controlling currents and pressure
- **Biomancy**: Adaptation magic, allowing transformation and evolution
- **Necromancy**: Particularly potent due to the preserved corpses of the drowned
- **Divination**: Clouded and unreliable, as if something interferes with foresight

## The Deepmind Phenomenon
Those who dwell too long in the depths report strange shared dreams and whispers from [[The Deepmind]], a possible collective consciousness or ancient entity that may have orchestrated the drowning.

## Major Threats
1. **The Rising Dark**: Abyssal creatures emerging from trenches with increasing frequency
2. **The Pressure Plague**: A magical disease that causes victims to implode
3. **Surface Raiders**: Air-breathing pirates using diving bells and magic to plunder
4. **The Tide Tyrants**: Corrupted water elementals claiming divine mandate
5. **The Memory Eaters**: Creatures that feed on the recollections of the surface world

## Resources & Trade
- **Pearlsteel**: Magical metal forged from compressed pearls and coral
- **Glowkelp**: Bioluminescent plant used for light and alchemy
- **Depth Crystals**: Pressure-formed gems that store magical energy
- **Memory Bubbles**: Preserved moments from before the drowning, highly valuable
- **Leviathan Oil**: Harvested from deep sea monsters, powers magical machinery

## The Prophecy of Resurfacing
An ancient prophecy speaks of [[The Emergence]], when Aquabyssos will rise again, but interpretations vary:
- Some believe it means the waters will recede
- Others think the underwater civilization will conquer the surface
- The darkest interpretation suggests everything above will be drowned too

## Important Artifacts
- [[The Pressure Crown]]: Worn by the last surface king, location unknown
- [[The Breathing Stone]]: Allows perfect underwater adaptation
- [[Tide Turner's Trident]]: Can supposedly reverse the Great Drowning
- [[The Depth Chart]]: Map to the source of the flooding

## Calendar System
The Aquabyssos Calendar marks time in "Tides" (months) and "Currents" (years):
- Years are counted as "After Drowning" (AD)
- Current Year: 247 AD
- 13 Tides per Current, named after water conditions

## Languages
- **High Aquan**: Formal language of nobility and magic
- **Bubble Speak**: Common tongue mixing surface languages
- **Deep Sign**: Pressure-resistant sign language
- **Echo Speech**: Sonic communication for long distances

## Current Events
1. [[The Deep Uprising]]: Abyssal creatures organizing under a mysterious leader
2. Missing pearl farms in the Twilight Reaches
3. Political tension over [[The Bathyal Succession]]
4. Discovery of intact pre-drowning ruins in [[The Cerulean Trench]]
5. Mysterious disappearances near [[The Whispering Depths]]

## DM Secrets
> [!warning] DM Only
> - The Great Drowning was intentional, caused by the surface kingdoms to trap an eldritch entity beneath the waters
> - The Deepmind is this entity, slowly corrupting inhabitants to free itself
> - The Cerulean Breath is actually the entity's essence, gradually transforming people into its servants
> - Several major NPCs are already fully converted but hiding it
> - The prophecy of Emergence refers to the entity's eventual escape

## Plot Hooks
- Ships from the surface world have started disappearing near Aquabyssos
