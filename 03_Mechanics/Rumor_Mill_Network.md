# Rumor Mill Network

## Procedural Rumor Generation
Roll 1d6 twice: Source and Subject.
- Sources: Dockhand, Pearl Guard, Syndicate Broker, Pilgrim, Archivist, Street Urchin.
- Subjects: Shard Sighting, Plague Cure, Hidden Route, Faction Betrayal, Guardian Demand, Ritual Timing.
Truth: 50% baseline; adjust ±20% by source reliability.

## Spread Mechanics
- Each scene, pick one rumor to propagate one step along connected locations in the [[09_Performance/Indexes/Location_Network_Graph.md|Network]].
- If players amplify, add +1 step and +10% truth if they verify.

## Faction Propaganda
- Pearl Guard lowers panic; Syndicate inflates scarcity; Verdant Accord highlights eco-harms.
- On a success, shift Market State by -1 or +1 in one location for a session.

## Player Reputation Impact
- Amplifying a false rumor imposes -1 with the most affected faction; correcting it grants +1 with the harmed party.
