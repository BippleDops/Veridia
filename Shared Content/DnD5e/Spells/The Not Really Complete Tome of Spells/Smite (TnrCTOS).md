# Smite (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *8th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You pick any point within range and shout out your godâ€™s wrath. All creatures within 20 feet of that point must make a Constitution saving throw; you may choose to exempt your allies, if they are in that area. The affected creatures are smote by an intense, obviously divine light.

A creature takes 12d6 lightning damage and is blinded and poisoned for 24 hours on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage and is blinded and poisoned for 1 hour on a successful one.
