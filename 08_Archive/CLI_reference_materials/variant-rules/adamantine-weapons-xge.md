# Adamantine Weapons
*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 78* 

Adamantine is an ultrahard metal found in meteorites and extraordinary mineral veins. In addition to being used to craft [adamantine armor](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/adamantine-armor-xdmg.md), the metal is also used for weapons.

Melee weapons and ammunition made of or coated with adamantine are unusually effective when used to break objects. Whenever an [adamantine weapon](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/adamantine-weapon-xdmg.md) or piece of [ammunition](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/adamantine-ammunition-xge.md) hits an object, the hit is a critical hit.

The adamantine version of a melee weapon or of ten pieces of ammunition costs 500 gp more than the normal version, whether the weapon or ammunition is made of the metal or coated with it.
