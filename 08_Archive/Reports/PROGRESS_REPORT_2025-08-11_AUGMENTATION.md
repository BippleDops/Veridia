2. Scene Framing integration â€” Quick session starters
3. Performance dashboards â€” Vault health monitoring
4. World Bible â€” Complete lore reference

### For Vault Maintenance
1. Link Integrity Report â€” Track broken references
2. Coverage Dashboard â€” Monitor completion
3. Asset metadata schema â€” Standardize media
4. Frontmatter standards â€” Ensure consistency

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Complete remaining transformation paths (29+ outlined)
2. Add "See Also" sections to high-traffic pages
3. Create additional asset metadata entries
4. Fix identified broken links

### Future Enhancements
1. Expand Deep Mother minion stat blocks
2. Create more player handouts
3. Build encounter generators using new systems
4. Develop campaign-specific dashboards

## Technical Notes

### Dataview Queries
All new indexes use efficient Dataview queries that:
- Filter appropriately to avoid performance issues
- Provide actionable information
- Update automatically as vault changes

### File Organization
New content follows established patterns:
- Mechanics in `03_Mechanics/`
- Lore in `02_Worldbuilding/Lore/`
- Indexes in `09_Performance/Indexes/`
- Handouts in appropriate player folders

### Link Patterns
Maintained consistency with:
- Wiki links for worldbuilding: `[[Path/Note]]`
- Preserved CLI absolute paths: `[](/03_Mechanics/...)`
- Aliases only where necessary
