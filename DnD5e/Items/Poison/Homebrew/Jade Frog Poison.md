# Jade Frog Poison
## Overview
The vibrantly colored tree [[Frog|frog]] that dwells high in the tree-tops of a jungle spends it’s life eating insects and drinking nectar, and secreting a toxin from it’s skin to keep from being

easy prey for the many serpents that also slither through the canopy overhead. Local tribes climb the trees in search for the creature so that they may coat their darts and [[Arrows|arrows]] in the

secreted [[Poisoned|poison]].

Once the [[Poisoned|poison]] has entered the victim’s system, the victim begins suffering from itching, and weeping lesions begin to form upon their flesh. The toxin continues to break down the

skin and internal organs until the victim perishes, leaking blood from their orifices.
