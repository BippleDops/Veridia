# Desecrated Ground
*Wilderness Hazard*  

Some cemeteries and catacombs are imbued with the unseen traces of ancient evil. An area of desecrated ground can be any size, and a [detect evil and good](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-evil-and-good-xphb.md) spell cast within range reveals its presence.

Undead standing on desecrated ground have advantage on all saving throws.

A vial of [holy water](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/holy-water-xphb.md) purifies a 10-foot-square area of desecrated ground when sprinkled on it, and a [hallow](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/hallow-xphb.md) spell purifies desecrated ground within its area.

## Player-Facing Summary

Desecrated ground is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of desecrated ground as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around desecrated ground.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties desecrated ground to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at desecrated ground to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to desecrated ground active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
