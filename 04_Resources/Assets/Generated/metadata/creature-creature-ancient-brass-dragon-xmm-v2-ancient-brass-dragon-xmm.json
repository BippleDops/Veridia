  "revised_prompt": "Envision a conceptual illustration of an ancient brass dragon, a creature breathing fantasy into the tabletop world. With attention to the unique muscular structure and its distinctive limbs, root the creature's design in a coherent medieval culture. Use traditional materials and avoid modern tech influence. Focus on the biomechanics of the dragon, accentuated with bioluminescent highlights, set in an environment that merges the underwater realm and the sky. Display a sense of movement while resonating aquatic realism. Incorporate subsurface caustic effects in this underwater skyscape with a contrasting human silhouette for perspective. The color palette should resonate deep maritime vibes, with teals, deep blues, and sea greens flowing with pearl highlights. Refrain from incorporating modern CGI, anime style, and unnecessary text, unless specified.",
