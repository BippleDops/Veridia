*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 219. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* Common mummies are the remains of priests, nobles, or champions of faith that underwent magical burial rites. Some are preserved through processes using linen wrappings or clay, but others are preserved by peat bogs, ice, magic, or other means. Roll on or choose a result from the Mummy Resurrections table to determine why a mummy has returned from the dead. **Mummy Resurrections**`dice: [](mummy-xmm.md#^mummy-resurrections)`| dice: `dice: 1d8` | The Mummy Reanimates To... |

Should their resting places be violated, these beings, known as mummies, reanimate their deteriorating bodies to restore the sanctity of their tombs and punish those who disturbed their rest. Mummies pursue those who offend them, typically mortals who desecrate their resting places, steal their burial treasures, or defile sites tied to their faith. With undying rage, these ancient corpses go to extreme lengths to avenge themselves and restore what they need to find peace. A mummy might look frail, but its body possesses supernatural strength, and its gaze can strike fear in the bravest hearts. Those who escape a mummy's grasp might find themselves subject to a terrible curse. Victims of a mummy's curse gradually wither, their bodies rotting away until they're reduced to dust. This curse can be healed only by the [[Remove Curse Xphb spell or similar magic.```statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of mummy xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around mummy xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[mummy-xmm (undead)
