*This serpent is 12 to 15 feet long and 5 feet thick. Its body scales are thick and hard, making it somewhat slower than other sea serpents but also giving it excellent armor. This serpent’s most notable feature, however, is multiple rows of long, sharp teeth that line its jaws beneath large, lidless red eyes with white pupils.*

## Special Traits
**Impale:** When a fanged sea serpent delivers a critical hit, it drives its fangs completely through the creatures body or limbs. An impaled creature is grappled and takes 10 (`dice: 1d12+4`) piercing damage at the start of each of the fanged sea serpents turns. It also takes 6 (`dice: 1d12`) piercing damage when it escapes from the grapple. A fanged sea serpent can have up to one Medium or two Small creatures impaled at one time.

## Actions
**Bite:*** Melee Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (`dice: 1d12+4`) piercing damage plus 7 (`dice: 2d6`) poison damage. The target must make a successful DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for `dice: 1d4` rounds. The fanged sea serpent scores a critical hit if its attack roll is a natural 18, 19, or 20; see Impale, above.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any aquatic

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, or swarm (3–20)

## Description
The sea serpents, great snakelike creatures that have roamed the oceans for ages, are nearly as old as the dragons that roam the sky. Unlike dragons, these great, scaly, serpentine beasts are products of natural evolution, though many scholars suspect magical influence, either deliberate or natural, somewhere in their evolution.

Sea serpents display great variation in size, color, intellect, and temperament. All of them, however, bear certain similarities. They are long, serpentine, warmblooded creatures that resemble snakes in appearance, though they also have two sets of flippers. On some sea serpents, these flippers are large and powerful, while on others they are so small and atrophied as to be almost unnoticeable. All sea serpents are aquatic, as their name implies, but they can survive for extended times out of water and some can even make their way about on land. Furthermore, all sea serpents are sentient, with intellects ranging from that of a smart dolphin to levels rivaling the smartest humans.

One trait that sea serpents share with dragons is a sense of innate superiority, a feeling that they are unequalled, unchallenged masters of the sea.

Unlike dragons, sea serpents are not distinguished by color or age. A few species are as acquisitive as dragons, but most have no interest in hoarding wealth or surrounding themselves with worshipful, lesser creatures. All sea serpents can speak and understand Aquatic, and many know Draconic as well. The more intelligent among them often learn the languages of nearby marine civilizations or the languages of seagoing surface dwellers.

In combat, most sea serpents use similar tactics. All have venomous bites, and all have the ability to trap prey in their coils and crush the life out of them the way a giant constrictor snake does. The largest sea serpents can even crush ships this way; mariners in their smoky dens delight in recounting tales of horror about great serpents that splintered mighty hulls and then gulped down the helpless sailors as they splashed in the water or sank into the brine.

Because they are intelligent, sea serpents can often be reasoned with or bargained with, if the bargainer has something the sea serpent wants and approaches as a supplicant, not an equal. They are adaptable to circumstances and never throw themselves into battle rashly.

The fanged sea serpent is a vicious predator of the sea. Although it is much smaller than other sea monsters such as the bine serpent or the deep hunter, it is greatly feared for its tendency to travel in packs that swarm over creatures or vessels much larger than any individual member of the pack.

Fanged sea serpents are nomadic. They follow the ocean currents yearround, which means they can be found all around the world—but only for part of the year. Fishermen often take their vacations during the season when fanged sea serpents are swarming in nearby water.

An attack by fanged sea serpents is a terrifying sight. They close in on selected prey from all sides, and the water boils and foams red from the writhing, splashing bodies tearing at the unfortunate victim. Fanged sea serpents have been known to attack their own kind, but only when starving.

Fanged sea serpents on their own usually live on large fish and avoid confronting intelligent creatures of any kind unless they are desperate or believe it’s a fight they can’t lose. They are fearless and aggressive in a group, however. Packs of fanged sea serpents are known to attack creatures much larger than themselves. Once a target is surrounded—and in water, “all sides” includes above and below, too—few marine creatures can stand up to a determined assault by these ferocious predators.
