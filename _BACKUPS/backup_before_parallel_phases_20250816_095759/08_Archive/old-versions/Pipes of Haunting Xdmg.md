--- # Pipes of Haunting

*Wondrous item, uncommon* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/pipes-of-haunting.webp#right) These pipes have 3 charges and regain`d3`expended charges daily at dawn. You can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a **DC 15** Wisdom saving throw or have the [conditions#frightened|Frightened]] condition for 1 minute. A creature that fails the save repeats it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its save is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 285.
