# Vicious Vine
*Generic Hazard*  

Vicious vines are animated by magic. They often cling to doorways, archways, walls, and statuary. Until a vicious vine moves, there's nothing to distinguish it from an inanimate vine.

Each vicious vine has AC 11; HP 16; and Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Psychic damage. When a creature enters a space within 5 feet of the vine for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the vine tries to coil around that creature. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or have the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Grappled|Grappled]] condition (escape DC 12). While Grappled in this way, the target takes 5 (`d10`) Necrotic damage from the vine's life-draining thorns at the start of each of the target's turns. The vine can grapple only one creature at a time.

As an [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Influence|Influence]] action, a character under the effect of a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/speak-with-plants-xphb|Speak with Plants]] spell or similar magic can try to persuade the vine to release its victim, doing so with a successful DC 10 Charisma ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Persuasion|Persuasion]]) check. A creature released by the vine in this way won't be attacked by that vine again for the next 24 hours.

## At Higher Levels

You can scale the hazard for higher levels by increasing the Necrotic damage, the save DC, and the escape DC, as shown in the following table.

| Levels | Necrotic Damage | Save/Escape DC |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| 5–10 | 11 (`2d10`) | 14 |
| 11–16 | 22 (`4d10`) | 16 |
| 17–20 | 55 (`10d10`) | 18 |
