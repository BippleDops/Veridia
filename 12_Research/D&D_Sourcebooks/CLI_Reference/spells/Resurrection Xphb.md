--- # Resurrection

*7th-level, Necromancy* - **Casting time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth 1,000+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous With a touch, you revive a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a century, didn't die of old age, and wasn't Undead when it died. The creature returns to life with all its [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]]. This spell also neutralizes any poisons that affected the creature at the time of death. This spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body parts. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to [[d20-test-xphb (variant-rules)]]. Every time the target finishes a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]], the penalty is reduced by 1 until it becomes 0. Casting this spell to revive a creature that has been dead for 365 days or longer taxes you. Until you finish a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]], you can't cast spells again, and you have [[Advantage Xphb]] on [[d20-test-xphb (variant-rules)]]. **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 312.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of resurrection xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around resurrection xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The First Prophecy of Shadows ## Plot Hooks - Someone is hunting information for love
