  "revised_prompt": "Imagine a heroic fantasy scene in a tabletop setting, akin to Dungeons & Dragons 5e. It is firmly rooted within medieval-fantasy, so there's no sign of modern technology. The art style is similar to an old painter's collection, focusing on the sense of atmosphere and cinematic lighting. Our adventurers catch the first glimpse of Abyssos Prime, serving as a clear focal point of narrative intrigue. The scene is further enriched with atmospheric visual effects and high-fidelity illustrations. This underwater city basks in the aquatic realism of subtended light caustics, supported by bioluminescent accents. The city is encased in a dome-like structure, made of materials capable of withstanding the immense pressure of the deep sea. The colour palette is rich in the hues of the ocean, featuring teals, deep blues, sea-greens and accents of pearl highlights. Avoid the use of glaring light effects, modern signage or science fiction user interfaces. Pay attention to the resolution and remove any distortion or artifacts. Rather than extensive text, opt for iconography or blank signboards. Any included symbols should carry meaning, and if numbered pins are used, they should not come across as garbled or random.",
