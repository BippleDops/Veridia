# Reflection Pools

*"In still waters, the future ripples backward to the present." - Oracle Miraleth*

## Overview
The Reflection Pools are a sacred site consisting of seven perfectly circular pools of unnaturally still water, each capable of showing visions of past, present, or future events. Located in the Temple District's quietest corner, these pools serve both religious and practical purposes for divination, meditation, and seeking guidance.

## The Seven Pools
1. **Pool of Memory** - Reveals past events
2. **Pool of Truth** - Shows present reality without illusion
3. **Pool of Possibility** - Displays potential futures
4. **Pool of Hearts** - Reveals emotional truths and desires
5. **Pool of Shadows** - Shows hidden or secret information
6. **Pool of Distance** - Observes remote locations
7. **Pool of Dreams** - Connects to sleeping minds

## Usage and Rituals
**Divination Services:** Oracles use pools for prophecy and guidance
**Investigation Aid:** Authorities consult pools for crime solving
**Personal Seeking:** Individuals seeking life direction
**Academic Research:** Scholars studying historical events
**Diplomatic Intelligence:** Covert observation of foreign activities

## Current Guardians
**Oracle Miraleth:** Chief seer managing pool access
**Apprentice Seers:** Students learning divination arts
**Temple Guards:** Protection from misuse or disruption

## Restrictions and Dangers
- Pools may show false or misleading visions
- Extended viewing can cause madness or obsession
- Some visions are deliberately blocked by powerful magic
- Certain questions anger the pools' mysterious intelligence
- Multiple viewers may see conflicting images

## Recent Visions
- Disturbing glimpses of shadow creatures in city tunnels
- Visions of surface world conflict affecting trade
- Prophetic images of underwater volcanic activity
- Mysterious figures gathering in secret locations

## Adventure Hooks
1. Pool shows vision of party's death unless they act quickly
2. False visions are being planted by unknown magical interference
3. Someone has poisoned one of the pools with corrupting magic
4. Vision reveals location of crucial information or artifact
5. Pool watchers request protection during dangerous divination ritual

## Services and Costs
**Basic Reading:** 100 gp for simple question
**Detailed Vision:** 500 gp for complex inquiry
**Historical Research:** 250 gp per historical period
**Location Scrying:** 300 gp to observe distant place
**Emergency Consultation:** 1000 gp for immediate access

## DM Notes
Use the Reflection Pools as plot devices to provide information, foreshadow events, or create red herrings. Visions should be symbolic rather than literal, requiring interpretation and potentially misleading parties into interesting complications.
