# Dragon Wing Bow

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** varies

**Attunement**: *requires attunement*

## Description

The limb tips of this magic bow are shaped like a dragon's wings, and the weapon is infused with the essence of a chromatic, gem, or metallic dragon's breath. When you hit with an attack roll using this magic bow, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the same type as the breath infused in the bowâ€”acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, poison, psychic, radiant, or thunder.

If you load no ammunition in the weapon, it produces its own, automatically creating one piece of magic ammunition when you pull back the string. The ammunition created by the bow vanishes the instant after it hits or misses a target.

**Base items.** This item variant can be applied to the following base items:
- [[Hand Crossbow]] (Dragon Wing Hand Crossbow)
- [[Heavy Crossbow]](Dragon Wing Heavy Crossbow)
- [[Light Crossbow]] (Dragon Wing Light Crossbow)
- [[Light Repeating Crossbow]] (Dragon Wing Light Repeating Crossbow)
