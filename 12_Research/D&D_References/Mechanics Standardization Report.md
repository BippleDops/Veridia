# Mechanics Standardization Report
*Documentation of Changes Made to Unify Game Systems*

## Executive Summary

This report documents the comprehensive standardization of all game mechanics across the Aquabyssos and Aethermoor campaign settings. The standardization addressed significant inconsistencies in difficulty classes, currency systems, progression mechanics, and resource management that were identified across 50+ mechanics files.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Difficulty Class Inconsistencies

**Problems Found**:
- Pressure saves ranged from DC 10-22 across different files
- Sanity saves varied between DC 10-25 with no clear progression
- Shadow control DCs were inconsistent (10-20 range)
- Environmental modifiers applied differently across systems

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Unified DC progression: Easy (10), Moderate (13), Hard (16), Very Hard (20), Legendary (25)
- Standardized environmental modifiers: -2 to +10 based on conditions
- Consistent save DC formulas across all systems
- Clear guidelines for when to use each difficulty level

### 2. Currency & Resource System Conflicts

**Impact**: Combat encounters now have predictable mechanics regardless of environment or character adaptation level.

## Specific DC Standardizations

### Before Standardization
- Pressure saves: DC 10-22 (inconsistent progression)
- Sanity saves: DC 10-25 (unclear triggers)
- Shadow control: DC 10-20 (random difficulty)
- Memory resistance: DC 12-18 (no clear system)

### After Standardization
- Pressure saves: DC 10 + (depth/1000ft) with clear modifiers
- Sanity saves: DC 12-25 based on horror magnitude
- Shadow control: DC 10 + autonomy level (consistent progression)
- Memory resistance: DC 14 + pearls consumed today

## Currency Unification

### Previous System Issues
- Memory pearls: 10-500 gp (same item, different files)
- Pressure suits: 500-5,000 gp (unclear progression)
- Services: Widely varying costs across systems

### Unified System
- Consistent currency conversion table
- Standardized equipment progression by quality
- Balanced service costs across all regions
- Clear guidelines for inflation/deflation

## Progression Balance Changes

### Adaptation Points
- **Old**: Varied from 1 AP/day to 1 AP/hour randomly
- **New**: Consistent scaling: 1 AP/week (surface) to 5 AP/hour (void zone)

### Sanity Recovery
- **Old**: 1-3 points per rest (inconsistent)
- **New**: 1d4 to 1d12 based on character level

### Shadow Autonomy
- **Old**: Unclear triggers and progression
- **New**: Clear 6-level system with specific triggers

## Files Modified/Superseded

The following files contained mechanics that are now superseded by the Unified Mechanics Guide:

1. **Complete_Pressure_Adaptation_System.md** - AP rates and DC progressions
2. **Depth Survival Mechanics.md** - Pressure save DCs and environmental effects
3. **Crystal Plague Mechanics.md** - Corruption progression rates
4. **Deep Mother Sanity System.md** - Sanity loss triggers and recovery
5. **Shadow Separation Mechanics.md** - Autonomy progression and control DCs
6. **Comprehensive Survival System.md** - Various DC inconsistencies
7. **Memory_Trading_Economy.md** - Currency values and absorption limits
8. **Underwater Combat Rules.md** - Combat modifiers and movement penalties

## Implementation Guidelines

### For DMs
1. **Primary Reference**: Always consult Unified Mechanics Guide first
2. **Conversion**: Use provided conversion table for old DC references
