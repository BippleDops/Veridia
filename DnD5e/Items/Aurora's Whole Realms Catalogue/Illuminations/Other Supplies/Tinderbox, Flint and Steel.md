## Description
All of my tinderboxes are constructed of sturdy heart of oak for durability, and resistance to warping, dings, and scratches. They include a number of [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Items|items]]: the waterproofed, small oak box, a large piece of flint, several coarse steel bars, tinder, and scraps of charred cloth (15 sp, 5 sp for just the flint and steel).

## Additional Details
A character can start a small smoldering flame in `dice: 1d6` rounds (longer in windy conditions or if the kindling is wet).
