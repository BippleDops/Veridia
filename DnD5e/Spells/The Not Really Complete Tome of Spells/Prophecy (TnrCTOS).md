# Prophecy (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *divination*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 hour

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a plant with hallucinatory properties or a hallucinatory drug, which is burned during the casting of the spell, and a crystal worth at least 1,000 gp)

**Duration**: 10 minutes


## Effects
You enter a long trance and get a vision of the future, which describes an important event that shall occur at some point in the near future. It may be vague and open to interpretation. In addition, the DM will secretly roll a d10. On a roll of 1, the vision will be completely false.

If you touch another creature while casting this spell, then the prophecy will be about an event that directly concerns that creature.

If you attempt to cast this spell more than once about a single event, you will receive the same visions.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using an 8th- or 9th-level spell slot, you can attempt to divine a prophecy that concerns an area as large as a kingdom. The DM will secretly roll a d10. On a roll of 1, the vision will be completely false; on a roll of 2-5, you will receive no vision at all.
