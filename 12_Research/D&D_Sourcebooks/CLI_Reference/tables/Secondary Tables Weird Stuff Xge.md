| 6 | You served a powerful adventurer as a hireling. You have only recently left that service. Use the supplemental tables and work with your DM to determine the basic details about your former employer. |

| 8 | A lover of yours was secretly a silver dragon. |
| 9 | You were captured by a cult and nearly sacrificed on an altar to the foul being the cultists served. You escaped, but you fear they will find you. |
| 10 | You met a demigod, an archdevil, an archfey, a demon lord, or a titan, and you lived to tell the tale. |
