## Special Traits
**Between Flux:** A mockingbeast’s body constantly shifts and changes in response to the Between plague that infuses it, reshaping and rebuilding it in hideous ways. At the start of each of the mockingbeast’s turns, roll `dice: 1d10` and check the following table to see what effect the between flux has. All of the listed mutations last 1 minute except for results 9 and 10, which are instantaneous. `dice: 1d10` Result


| **`dice: 1d10`** | **Result** |
|---|---|
| 1 | The mockingbeast gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls (max +6). |
| 2 | The mockingbeast gains resistance to each damage type that strikes it, after taking the initial damage. |
| 3 | Creatures that do slashing or piercing damage to the mockingbeast from a distance of 5 feet or less take `dice: 1d6` acid damage (max `dice: 3d6`) from digestive fluid spraying out of the wound. |
| 4 | The mockingbeast’s AC increases by 2 (max 19). |
| 5 | The mockingbeast’s Multiattack ability allows it to make one additional grab attack (max 6/turn). |
| 6 | The mockingbeast grows appendages that increase its standard and climb speeds by 10 feet each (max 50 ft., climb 40 ft.). |
| 7 | The mockingbeast gains 25 temporary hit points. |
| 8 | The mockingbeast gains blindsight 30 feet or the range of its blindsight increases by 30 feet (max 90 feet). |
| 9 | The mockingbeast emits a cloud of poisonous vapor. Creatures within 5 feet of the mockingbeast must make a successful DC 14 Con saving throw or be poisoned until the end of their next turn. |
| 10 | The mockingbeast unleashes a burst of psychic energy. Creatures within 30 feet of the mockingbeast must make a successful DC 14 Wis saving throw or be frightened of the mockingbeast until the end of their next turn. |

**Insanity:** A mockingbeast’s mind is a raw chaos of madness. It uses its Cha modifier for Wis saving throws. Any attempt to contact a mockingbeast telepathically (including spells such as detect thoughts and dominate monster) produces a backlash that does `dice: 2d8` Psychic damage to the creature attempting the contact, or half damage with a successful DC 14 Wis saving throw.

**Mocking Plague:** Symptoms appear `dice: 1d6` hours after a creature is infected. At that time, the creature gains 1 level of exhaustion and its Charisma score is reduced by 2. The infected creature must make a DC 15 Con saving throw after every 6 hours. If the saving throw fails, the creature gains another level of exhaustion and its Charisma is reduced by 2. The disease can be cured by magic or when the infected creature succeeds on two consecutive Con saving throws. A victim that gains a 6th level of exhaustion or has its Charisma reduced to 0 by mocking plague must make a DC 10 Con saving throw. If it succeeds, the creature dies normally; if it fails, the creature instead transforms into a mockingbeast.

**Resistant to Transformation:** Effects that alter the mockingbeast’s form end at the start of the mockingbeast’s next turn, when it automatically returns to its normal form (no action required).

## Actions
Multiattack: The mockingbeast makes three grab attacks with its tentacles.

Melee Attack—Grab: +7 to hit (reach 15 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d8 + 4` bludgeoning damage, and a Medium or smaller creature must make a successful DC 14 Dex saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 14) and pulled to within 5 feet of the mockingbeast. The mockingbeast makes an immediate Bite attack against a creature that was just grappled as part of the same action.

Melee Attack—Bite: +7 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one grappled creature). Hit: `dice: 2d4 + 4` piercing damage, and a creature must make a successful DC 15 Con saving throw or be infected with Mocking Plague (see below).

## Legendary Actions
The mockingbeast can take up to three legendary actions per round. Legendary actions are taken at the end of another creature’s turn, and only one can be taken after each turn.

**Bite:** The mockingbeast bites a grappled target.

**Grab:** The mockingbeast makes one grab attack.

**Flux (uses 2 actions):** The mockingbeast forces a mutation to occur. Roll on the Between Flux table.

## Description
**Environment**: Any (Between)

**Organization**: Solitary or pair

The mocking plague is a supernatural Between disease spread by Between vampires and some other [[Appendix A - Between Creatures|Between creatures]]. Most creatures that contract this horrific infection die from the mutations it causes, but some are instead transformed into aberrations known as mockingbeasts. These monsters embody the biological chaos that the mocking plague causes, changing their forms to survive attacks they are subject to or to better spread the disease that created them.
