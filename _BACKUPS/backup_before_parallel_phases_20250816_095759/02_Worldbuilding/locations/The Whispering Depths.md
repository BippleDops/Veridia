## Overview
A region of [[Aquabyssos World Overview where sound behaves unnaturally, The Whispering Depths is avoided by all but the desperate or insane. Sounds from the past, future, and other dimensions echo through the water, driving visitors mad with constant whispered secrets, lies, and half-truths. The [Depth Wardens]] have declared it a quarantine zone after losing three full patrols to "whisper madness."

### The Babel Streams
Currents carrying conversations in unknown languages. Linguists who study them report understanding everything and nothing simultaneously.

### The Secret Gardens
Kelp forests where every plant whispers different secrets. The secrets are always true but knowing them brings only suffering.

### The Echo Chamber
Natural amphitheater where sounds from across time converge. [[Mad Oracle Thessaly lives here, sorting through the chaos for prophecies.

### The Silence Pools
Pockets of absolute silence that are somehow more terrifying than the whispers. Those who enter often refuse to speak again.

### The Confession Depths
Waters that compel visitors to speak their darkest secrets aloud, where the whispers repeat them eternally.

### Effects on Visitors
1. Stage 1 (Hours): Distraction, mishearing companions
2. Stage 2 (Days): Paranoia, hearing personal secrets
3. Stage 3 (Weeks): Responding to whispers, losing identity
4. Stage 4 (Months): Complete whisper madness
5. Stage 5 (Years): Becoming a whisper yourself

### The Whisper-Mad
Former explorers who stayed too long, now part of the cacophony. They speak only in echoes of things they've heard.

### Echo Prophets
Individuals who claim to understand the whisper patterns and offer guidance for a price - usually sanity.

### The Silent Ones
Those who voluntarily deafened themselves to escape the whispers but remain to study the phenomenon through vibrations.

### Sonic Predators
Creatures evolved to hunt using the whispers, turning sound itself into a weapon.

### The Library of Lies
Underwater structure where false whispers are strongest. Contains books that rewrite themselves based on the reader's fears.

### The Truth Well
Deep pit where only absolute truths are whispered. Most who hear them attempt suicide.

### The Quiet Ship
Perfectly preserved vessel in a silence pool. Crew found dead with expressions of absolute terror, no sign of struggle.
