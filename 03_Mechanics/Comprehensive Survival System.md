# Comprehensive Aquabyssos Survival System
## Complete Mechanics for Underwater Horror Survival

> *"The depths don't just test your bodyâ€”they test your identity, sanity, memory, and soul."*

## ðŸ“Š Quick Reference Dashboard

| Depth | Pressure DC | Adaptation Rate | Shadow Activity | Memory Risk | Sanity Strain |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|
| 0-500ft | DC 10 | 1 AP/4hr | None | None | DC 10/day |
| 501-1,000ft | DC 12 | 1 AP/3hr | Twitches | DC 12/week | DC 12/day |
| 1,001-5,000ft | DC 14 | 1 AP/2hr | Independent moments | DC 14/day | DC 14/12hr |
| 5,001-10,000ft | DC 16 | 1 AP/hr | 1 hr autonomy/day | DC 16/12hr | DC 16/6hr |
| 10,000ft+ | DC 18+ | 2 AP/hr | Full separation possible | DC 18/6hr | DC 18/3hr |

## ðŸŒŠ Core Survival Mechanics

### 1. Pressure System (Physical)

#### Immediate Pressure Effects
**Every depth change requires Constitution saves:**
- **Descending**: DC = 10 + (depth in thousands of feet)
- **Ascending**: DC = 12 + (depth change in thousands)
- **Rapid Change** (>1000ft/minute): Disadvantage + 2d6 damage
- **Failure Effects**:
  - 1st Failure: 1 exhaustion level
  - 2nd Failure: 1d6 damage + 1 Adaptation Point
  - 3rd Failure: 2d6 damage + stunned 1 round
  - 4th+ Failure: Unconscious, dying

#### Pressure Sickness
Long-term exposure without protection:
- **Stage 1** (1-4 hours): Headaches, -2 to mental checks
- **Stage 2** (4-8 hours): Nosebleeds, disadvantage on CON saves
- **Stage 3** (8-12 hours): Organ stress, 1 exhaustion/hour
- **Stage 4** (12+ hours): System failure, death saves

#### Pressure Adaptation Methods
- **Natural**: Gain resistance after 50+ AP
- **Magical**: Water Breathing doesn't prevent pressure
- **Technological**: Pressure suits (limited duration)
- **Biological**: Depth mutations (permanent changes)

### 2. Breathing Medium Transitions

#### Water-Air Interface Zones
Special areas where both mediums exist:
- **Bubble Rooms**: Air pockets in water (stale, limited)
- **Spray Zones**: Water droplets in air (difficult breathing)
- **Transition Layers**: Neither air nor water (CON DC 15/round)
- **Inverse Spaces**: Water that acts like air

#### Breathing Mechanics by Adaptation Stage
| Stage | Water Breathing | Air Breathing | Transition Time |
|-------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 0 | None | Normal | N/A |
| 1 | 1 minute Ã— CON | Normal | 1 hour buffer |
| 2 | 10 minutes Ã— CON | Difficult (DC 12) | 30 min buffer |
| 3 | 1 hour Ã— CON | Very Difficult (DC 15) | 10 min buffer |
| 4 | Permanent | Impossible outdoors | No buffer |
| 5 | Only water | Death in air | Instant |

### 3. Shadow Separation Mechanics

#### Shadow Independence Progression
**Daily Shadow Autonomy Check** (d20 + AP over 50):

| Roll Total | Shadow Behavior | Duration | Control DC |
|-----------|----------------|----------|------------|
| 1-10 | Normal shadow | â€” | â€” |
| 11-15 | Delayed mimicry | Constant | â€” |
| 16-20 | Different gestures | 10 minutes | Persuasion 15 |
| 21-25 | Independent action | 1 hour | Persuasion 18 |
| 26-30 | Verbal communication | 2 hours | Persuasion 20 |
| 31+ | Complete separation | 24 hours | Impossible |

#### Shadow Interaction Rules
- **Communication**: Shadows know all forgotten memories
- **Cooperation**: Requires successful Persuasion/Intimidation
- **Combat**: Shadows can fight (Shadow Demon stats)
- **Replacement**: At 100 AP, shadow can swap places (WIS DC 20)

#### Shadow Equipment
| Item | Effect | Cost | Availability |
|------|--------|------|--------------|
| Shadow Locks | Prevents separation 24hr | 1,000gp | Uncommon |
| Shadow Whistle | Summons shadow back | 500gp | Uncommon |
| Unity Collar | Merges shadow temporarily | 5,000gp | Rare |
| Shadow Gem | Stores shadow safely | 10,000gp | Very Rare |

### 4. Memory & Identity System

#### Memory Degradation
**Exposure to Memory-Affecting Phenomena:**

**Memory Tides** (Twice yearly + surges):
- **Contact**: WIS DC 16 or affected
- **Effects** (d100):
  - 01-20: Gain helpful memory (+1 skill for 24hr)
  - 21-40: Neutral memory (flavor only)
  - 41-60: Traumatic memory (frightened 1hr)
  - 61-80: False memory (believe lie)
  - 81-95: Lost memory (forget something important)
  - 96-00: Alien memory (gain 1d6 AP + confusion)

**Memory Protection:**
- Memory Anchors: Advantage on saves
- Mind Blank: Immunity for duration
- Written Records: Can restore lost memories
- Shadow Reminder: Shadows remember everything

#### Identity Crisis Events
**Triggers:**
- Meeting duplicate/prototype
- Shadow acting independently  
- Memory tide exposure
- Depth hallucinations
- Timeline paradoxes

**Identity Check** (WIS DC varies):
- **Success**: Maintain sense of self
- **Failure**: Roll on Identity Crisis table
- **Critical Failure**: Complete dissociation

| d10 | Identity Crisis Effect |
|-----|----------------------|
| 1 | Believe you're someone else (1 hour) |
| 2 | Forget your name (until reminded) |
| 3 | Adopt shadow's personality (10 minutes) |
| 4 | Speak in third person (1 day) |
| 5 | Don't recognize allies (1 hour) |
| 6 | Believe you're from another timeline |
| 7 | Think you're already dead |
| 8 | Merge personalities with nearby person |
| 9 | Forget your purpose |
| 10 | Complete ego death (new personality) |

### 5. Sanity & Madness System

#### Sanity Score
- **Starting Sanity**: 10 + WIS modifier
- **Maximum**: 20
- **Minimum**: 0 (complete madness)

#### Sanity Loss Triggers
| Event | Sanity Loss | Save |
|-------|-------------|------|
| First depth sickness | 1 | WIS DC 10 |
| Seeing shadow act alone | 1d3 | WIS DC 12 |
| Meeting duplicate | 1d4 | WIS DC 14 |
| Timeline paradox | 1d6 | WIS DC 16 |
| Singer contact | 2d6 | WIS DC 18 |
| Reality breakdown | 3d6 | WIS DC 20 |

#### Madness Effects by Sanity Level
- **16-20**: Clear minded
- **11-15**: Quirks (roleplay effects)
- **6-10**: Minor madness (disadvantage on WIS)
- **3-5**: Major madness (roll on table)
- **1-2**: Severe madness (barely functional)
- **0**: Complete break (NPC control)

### 6. Nutrition & Sustenance

#### Deep Food Sources
| Food Type | Nutrition | Side Effects | AP Gain |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Surface rations | Poor | None | 0 |
| Kelp/Seaweed | Moderate | Mild nausea | 0 |
| Deep fish | Good | Bioluminescence | +1 |
| Crystallized nutrients | Excellent | Mineral buildup | +1 |
| Memory kelp | Variable | Memory swap | +1d3 |
| Shadow fruit | Filling | Shadow activity | +2 |

#### Starvation in the Depths
- Exhaustion accumulates faster (every 2 days)
- Adaptation increases hunger (Ã—1.5 food needed)
- Can sustain on emotional energy at high adaptation

### 7. Sleep & Rest Complications

#### Sleep Disruptions
| Depth | Sleep Quality | Dream Effects |
|-------|---------------|---------------|
| 0-1000ft | Normal | Normal dreams |
| 1001-5000ft | Disturbed | Prophetic dreams |
| 5001-10000ft | Difficult | Shared dreams |
| 10000ft+ | Impossible | Waking dreams |

#### Rest Mechanics
- **Short Rest**: Requires pressure equilibrium
- **Long Rest**: Needs secure location + pressure suit
- **Exhaustion Recovery**: Only 1 level per long rest
- **Spell Recovery**: Normal but dreams may alter spells

### 8. Equipment Degradation

#### Corrosion Rates
| Material | Degradation | Time to Failure |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Cloth/Leather | Fast | 1 week |
| Iron/Steel | Moderate | 2 weeks |
| Special metals | Slow | 1 month |
| Magic items | Resistant | 3 months |
| Crystalline | Immune | Never |

#### Maintenance Requirements
- Daily: Check seals, clean salt
- Weekly: Oil metal, repair tears
- Monthly: Full overhaul or -1 AC

### 9. Navigation & Communication

#### Depth Navigation Challenges
- **Darkness**: No sunlight below 600ft
- **Currents**: STR DC 10-18 to maintain course
- **Pressure Walls**: Invisible depth barriers
- **Void Currents**: Erase direction sense
- **Memory Zones**: Forget where you're going

#### Communication Methods
| Method | Range | Reliability | Risk |
|--------|-------|-------------|------|
| Verbal | 30ft | Poor | Attracts predators |
| Bioluminescent | 120ft | Moderate | Reveals position |
| Sonic (clicks) | 300ft | Good | Causes echoes |
| Telepathic | 60ft | Excellent | Sanity drain |
| Shadow speech | Unlimited | Perfect | Shadow activation |
