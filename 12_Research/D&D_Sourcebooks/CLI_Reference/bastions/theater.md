Rehearsals and other preparations take 14 days, followed by at least 7 days of performances. The performances can continue indefinitely until a new production gets underway. You or another character can contribute to a production in the following ways: - **Composer/Writer.** A character can compose music or write a script for a concert or production that hasn't started rehearsals yet. This effort takes 14 days. - **Conductor/Director.** A character who remains in the Bastion for the entirety of the production can serve as the concert's conductor or the production's director. - **Performer.** A character who remains in the Bastion for the entirety of the rehearsal period can be a star performer in one or more of the performances; one of the Theater's hirelings can serve as an understudy for additional performances. At the end of a rehearsal period, each character who contributed to the concert or production can make a DC 15 Charisma ([[skills#Performance|Performance]]) check. If more of these checks succeed than fail, you and any other character who contributed to the concert or production each gain a Theater die, a`d6`. This die changes to a`d8`when you reach level 13 and a`d10`when you reach level 17. At any point after the rehearsals end, a character can expend their Theater die to roll it and add the number rolled to one [[d20-test-xphb (variant-rules)]] they make, immediately after rolling the`d20`. If a character hasn't expended their Theater die before gaining another, their first die is lost. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 348* ## Player-Facing Summary Theater is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of theater as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around theater. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[Campaign_Relationship_Matrix]]
