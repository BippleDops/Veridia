# The Crystalline Wastes
*Where Crystal Growth Runs Wild*

## Overview
The Crystalline Wastes dominate northern [[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/Locations/Aethermoor]], a haunting landscape where Aether Crystals grow unchecked. Here, crystalline spires pierce the sky, the ground sparkles with crystal dust, and reality itself seems unstable. This is where [[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/Lore/The Great Crystallization]] began, and where crystal corruption is at its strongest.

## Geography

### Landmark Features
- **The First Spire**: Original eruption point, 500 feet tall
- **The Singing Valleys**: Crystals resonate with otherworldly music
- **The Mirror Lakes**: Perfectly reflective crystal formations
- **The Shattered Plains**: Broken crystal fields, razor sharp
- **The Chromatic Storms**: Weather infused with crystal energy

### Notable Locations
- **[[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/Locations/The Shattered Sanctum]]**: Hidden temple, possible base of [[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/NPCs/The Crimson Sage]]
- **Corruption's Heart**: Center of the wastes, pure corruption
- **The Lost Expedition Camp**: [[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/NPCs/Captain Thaddeus Blackwater]]'s last known location
- **Crystal Graveyard**: Where the corrupted come to die
- **The Wanderer's Refuge**: Only safe haven, run by [[Elder Matthias Stoneward]]

## Environmental Hazards

### Crystal Storms
- Occur every 2-3 days
- Razor-sharp crystal shards in wind
- 2d6 slashing damage per round exposed
- Constitution save DC 15 or gain corruption point

### Corruption Zones
- **Mild** (Outer edges): DC 10 Con save daily
- **Moderate** (Most areas): DC 15 Con save every 12 hours  
- **Severe** (Deep wastes): DC 20 Con save every hour

### Reality Distortions
- Time flows differently (1d4 hours = 1 hour outside)
