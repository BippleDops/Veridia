--- # Melf's Minute Meteors

*3rd-level, Evocation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (niter, sulfur, and pine tar formed into a bead)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes You create six tiny meteors in your space. They float in the air and orbit you for the spell's duration. When you cast the spellâ€”and as a bonus action on each of your turns thereafterâ€”you can expend one or two of the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet of you. Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes. Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes`2d6`fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. **At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd. **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 161* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Melfs minute meteors xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
