Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of World Map as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around World Map. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Strange disappearances suggest a conspiracy

- A prisoner has gone missing and war looms
- A stranger needs help stealing before dawn ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
