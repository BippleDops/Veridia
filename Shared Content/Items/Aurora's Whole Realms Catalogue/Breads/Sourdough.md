## Description
A curious concoction from the Pirate Isles of the Inner Sea, this bread is made with a bit of dough from the previous batch, left to “go sour” in order to leaven the next batch. It has a pleasantly heavy consistency, and a hard, flaky crust. Sold in 2-lb round loaves, wonderful for use as trenchers at your next feast. (Slice off the top, scoop out the inside, and use the “bowl” that remains instead of your good wooden ones! The leftover bread is fine in bread puddings, stuffings, and the like.) Sourdough, 2-lb loaf: 15 sp.
