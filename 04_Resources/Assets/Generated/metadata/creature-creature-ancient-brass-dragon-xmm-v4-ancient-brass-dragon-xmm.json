  "revised_prompt": "A detailed and vivid concept art of the ancient brass dragon from medieval-fantasy tabletop universe, positioned next to a human silhouette for size comparison. The dragon is stationed in a unique environment that blends aquatic and sky elements together - imagine an underwater sky scene. Crafted in a painterly style, the dragon is designed to showcase exceptional musculature and distinct limbs. Use a three color palette featuring deep teals, blues, and sea-greens, punctuated with the gleam of pearl highlights. The image must certainly represent a sense of motion, utilizing subsurface caustics and an emphasis on aquatic fantasy realism. The dragon and other materials should present the illusion of being fashioned from pressurized dome substances, with highlighted spots of bioluminscent accents. Ensure there is no usage of modern tech or signage, nor anime style or photoreal CGI, striving for culturally coherent medieval fantasy gear. The image resolution should be high with no artifacts, and contains no embedded text or words unless specified. Keep any symbols meaningful or avoid them completely to ensure the scene remains focused and clear.",
