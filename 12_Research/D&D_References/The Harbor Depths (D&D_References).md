## Overview
The Harbor Depths represent the submerged underbelly of [[Port Meridian|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]], where the bustling surface port gives way to a treacherous underwater realm. This transition zone between [[Aethermoor|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] contains sunken ships, ancient ruins from before the great submersion, and the dangerous meeting point between two very different worlds. Crystal corruption seeps up from below while surface pollutants sink down, creating a unique and hazardous environment.

### Depth Zones

**The Shallows (0-20m)**
- Pier foundations and dock supports
- Clear water with good visibility
- Regular naval patrols and harbor traffic
- Safe for experienced divers with proper equipment

**The Twilight Zone (20-100m)**
- Sunken vessels and underwater ruins
- First signs of crystal corruption
- Reduced visibility, dangerous currents
- Domain of [[Independent Smugglers|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/Independent Smugglers]]

**The Shadow Depths (100-200m)**
- Ancient pre-submersion city ruins
- Heavy crystal contamination
- Home to depth-touched creatures
- Border region with [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] territory

## Quest Hooks
1. Royal Navy vessel went missing during routine patrol of the depths
2. Precious cargo containing magical artifacts lost in smuggler attack
3. Strange lights and sounds reported from the deepest trenches
4. Diplomat from [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] requires safe escort through dangerous waters
5. New form of crystal corruption threatens to spread to surface levels

## Player-Facing Summary

The Harbor Depths is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of The Harbor Depths as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around The Harbor Depths.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
