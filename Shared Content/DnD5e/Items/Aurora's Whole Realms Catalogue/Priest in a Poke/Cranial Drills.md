## Description
Despite their immateriality, headaches and madness can be persistent and torturous. I have found that a mug of ale and a good song can cure most of them, but others swear by the effects of cranial drills. I carry only one type of this suspicious apparatus for draining cranial pressure—a drill with sturdy iron construction and a gnomish ratchet mechanism. Though I doubt the true usefulness of such drills, I am told they can be occasionally effective. Even so, they should only be used by skilled surgeons (or joiners). Can also be used on wood. (10 gp)

## Additional Details
½ Dex check required to keep from killing patient; after roll percentiles—1 to 40 lowers Int 2 points, 41 to 70 lowers Int 1 point, 71 to 95 has no effect, 96 to 100 relieves symptoms
