--- # D20 Test

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 364. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* D20 Tests encompass the three main d20 rolls of the game: [[Ability Check Xphb, [attack-roll-xphb (variant-rules)]], and [[Death Saving Throw Xphb]]. If something in the game affects D20 Tests, it affects all three of these rolls. The DM determines whether a D20 Test is warranted in a given circumstance. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary D20 test xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
