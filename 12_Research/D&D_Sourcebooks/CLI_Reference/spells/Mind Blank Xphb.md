# Mind Blank
*8th-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 24 hours

Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch has [[immunity-xphb|Immunity]] to Psychic damage and the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] condition. The target is also unaffected by anything that would sense its emotions or alignment, read its thoughts, or magically detect its location, and no spell—not even [[wish-xphb|Wish]]—can gather information about the target, observe it remotely, or control its mind.

**Classes**: [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-abjurer-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Wizard (Abjurer)]]; [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]; [[list-spells-classes-wizard|Wizard]]
