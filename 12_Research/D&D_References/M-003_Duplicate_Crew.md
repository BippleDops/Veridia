## Player-Facing Summary

M 003 Duplicate Crew is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

Legends speak of M 003 Duplicate Crew as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around M 003 Duplicate Crew.
