## Overview
Scholar Vivienne is the kingdom's foremost expert on the history of [[The Seven Shards, having spent four decades collecting, translating, and analyzing every scrap of information about the [The Crown of Stars]] and its shattering. Unlike the obsessed seekers, she approaches the Shards with academic detachment, believing knowledge should be preserved regardless of its danger.

### 1. The Stolen Prophecy (Level 8-14)
Vivienne's complete research on Shard-related prophecies has been stolen by unknown parties. She needs the party's help to track down the thieves and recover the dangerous information before it can be misused.
- **Investigation**: Following clues through academic and criminal networks
- **Stakes**: Stolen prophecies could enable catastrophic Shard manipulation
- **Rewards**: 12,000gp, access to Archive resources, prophecy consultation services

### 2. The Authentication Crisis (Level 6-12)
A newly discovered artifact claims to be one of the Seven Shards, but Vivienne's analysis reveals disturbing inconsistencies. She needs protection while investigating whether it's a fake, a fragment, or something more dangerous.
- **Research**: Combining historical analysis with magical investigation
- **Danger**: Artifact's true nature threatens those who study it too closely
- **Consequences**: Results affect multiple factions' Shard-seeking efforts

### 3. The Forbidden Expedition (Level 10-16)
Vivienne has identified the location of a pre-Shattering archive that could contain crucial information about the Crown of Stars. She needs experienced adventurers to escort her to the dangerous site.
- **Location**: Ancient ruins protected by guardians and hazardous magic
- **Opposition**: Other factions racing to reach the archive first
- **Discovery**: Information that could change understanding of the Shards' true purpose

### 4. The Knowledge War (Level 9-15)
Multiple factions demand access to Vivienne's research, threatening violence if she doesn't share her findings. The party must help her navigate the political crisis while protecting academic neutrality.
- **Diplomacy**: Balancing competing faction demands and interests
- **Ethics**: Determining which knowledge should be shared and which withheld
- **Consequences**: Resolution affects future of scholarly independence

### 5. The Archive Defense (Level 11-17)
Religious extremists plan to destroy the Archive of Forgotten Things, viewing it as a source of dangerous corruption. Vivienne needs defenders to protect centuries of accumulated knowledge.
- **Preparation**: Setting up defenses and evacuation procedures
- **Combat**: Multi-stage battle protecting different archive sections
- **Stakes**: Loss could set back Shard research by decades
