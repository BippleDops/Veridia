# Drow Poison
## Overview
*[[Drow]]* *[[Poisoned|Poison]]** (Injury).* This [[Poisoned|poison]] is typically made only by the draw, and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature subjected to this [[Poisoned|poison]] must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [[Poisoned|poisoned]] for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also [[Unconscious|unconscious]] while [[Poisoned|poisoned]] in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
