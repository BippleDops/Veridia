--- # Ability Score and Modifier

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 360. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* A creature has six ability scores—Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma—each of which has a corresponding modifier. Add the modifier when you make a [[d20-test-xphb (variant-rules)]] Test with the corresponding ability or when a rule asks you to do so. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Ability score and modifier xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
