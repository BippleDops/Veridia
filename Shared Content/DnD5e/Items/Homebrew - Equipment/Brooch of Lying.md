## Description
The Brooch of Lying is a brass and silver brooch. A silver dragon [[Fly|fly]] wraps itself around brass mechanisms.

## Construction
This item first appears to be a detailed brooch. While pinned to any intelligent creature that creature is compelled to lie whenever asked a direct question. The brooch will work if pinned to clothing worn by the creature or if pinned firectly to the flesh of the creature. If not pinned to a creature or clothing currently being worn by a creature, the brooch has no effect.

While wearing the brooch, the creature will believe the lie to be the honest truth. Once the brooch is removed, the creature will know that they have lied.

## Additional Details
The wing that is covers the middle of the brooch is a level that enables and disables the magical effect. This allows the brooch to be carried safely by it's owner.
