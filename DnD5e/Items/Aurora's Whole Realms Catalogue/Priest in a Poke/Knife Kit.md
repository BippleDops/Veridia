## Description
At times, the only way to reach an ailing organ is to carve up what lies atop it. Though I do not condone such probings, I cannot deny the stories of their occasional success. I have also, heard of many deaths. But, for those few who might be saved, our knife kit includes 7 knives, 2 shears, 5 clamps, 3 sponges, 2 lenses, 10 curved and straight needles, and a spool of camel-hair thread—all you need to make quick work of any surgery. We recommend an unconscious patient. (10 gp)

## Additional Details
on a case-by-case basis for internal illness, the DM devises a brutal series of ½ Dex, Int, Wis, and Con (nausea) checks and requires a point-by-point statement of intention by the “surgeon”; DM decides success
