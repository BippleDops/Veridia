# Cloud of Daggers
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sliver of glass)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure spinning daggers in a 5-foot [[cube-area-of-effect-xphb|Cube]] centered on a point within range. Each creature in that area takes `4d4` Slashing damage. A creature also takes this damage if it enters the [[cube-area-of-effect-xphb|Cube]] or ends its turn there or if the [[cube-area-of-effect-xphb|Cube]] moves into its space. A creature takes this damage only once per turn.

On your later turns, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to teleport the [[cube-area-of-effect-xphb|Cube]] up to 30 feet.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `2d4` for each spell slot level above 2.
