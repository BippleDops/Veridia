--- # Pact of the Tome

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 157. Available in the SRD* Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure forth a book in your hand at the end of a [[short-rest-xphb or [long-rest-xphb]]. This Book of Shadows (you determine its appearance) contains eldritch magic that only you can access, granting you the benefits below. The book disappears if you conjure another book with this feature or if you die. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Cantrips and Rituals When the book appears, choose three cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells that have the [[Ritual Xphb tag. The spells can be from any class's spell list, and they must be spells you don't already have prepared. While the book is on your person, you have the chosen spells prepared, and they function as Warlock spells for you. ## Spellcasting Focus You can use the book as a [spellcasting-focus-xphb (variant-rules)]]. ## Player-Facing Summary Pact of the tome xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of pact of the tome xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around pact of the tome xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
