# Oathbinding (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V

**Duration**: 1 year


## Effects
You or one willing creature you touch vows to behave in a certain way for the length of the oath and, if it breaks its vow, to perform a certain act of contrition, which must be feasibly possible and not be suicidal in nature. Because this spell only affects willing creatures, it is effective on creatures that are immune to being charmed.

If the creature breaks its vow, even un-knowingly, it takes 1d10 psychic damage. If the creature then fails to perform the chosen act of contrition within 1 week, it takes 5d10 psychic damage, and its hit point total is reduced by that amount, until it performs the act of contrition.

Breaking the vow and performing the act of contrition does not end the spell. You may choose to end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it, and a *remove curse, greater restoration,* or *wish* spell also ends it.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells mentioned above.
