# Fangs of the Fire Snake
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 81*  

When you use the [[actions#Attack|Attack]] action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to cause tendrils of flame to stretch out from your fists and feet. Your reach with your unarmed strikes increases by 10 feet for that action, as well as the rest of the turn. A hit with such an attack deals fire damage instead of bludgeoning damage, and if you spend 1 ki point when the attack hits, it also deals an extra `d10` fire damage.
