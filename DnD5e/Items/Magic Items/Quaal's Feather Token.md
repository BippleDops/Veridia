## Description

This tiny object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly.

`dice: [[Quaal's Feather Token]]^Table]]`

| **d100** | **Feather Token** | **d100** | **Feather Token** |
| -------- | ----------------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| 01–20    | Anchor            | 51–65    | Swan boat         |
| 21–35    | Bird              | 66–90    | Tree              |

^Table

***Anchor.*** You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can’t be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.

***Bird.*** You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a [[Roc|roc]], but it obeys your simple commands and can’t [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]]. It can carry up to 500 pounds while [[13 - Movement and Position|flying]] at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.

***Fan.*** If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour] for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.

***Swan Boat.*** You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.

***Tree.*** You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.

***Whip.*** You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating [[Whip|whip]] takes its place. You can then use a [[12 - The Order of Combat|bonus action]] to make a melee [[2 - Casting a Spell|spell attack]] against a creature within 10 feet of the [[Whip|whip]], with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 [[17 - Damage and Healing|force]] damage.

As a [[12 - The Order of Combat|bonus action]] on your turn, you can direct the [[Whip|whip]] to [[13 - Movement and Position|fly]] up to 20 feet and repeat the [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are [[Incapacitated|incapacitated]] or die.
