# Conjure Woodland Beings
*4th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (10-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You conjure nature spirits that flit around you in a 10-foot [[Area of Effect Xphb]] for the duration. Whenever the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] enters the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] or ends its turn there, you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes `5d8` Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

In addition, you can take the [[actions#Disengage|Disengage]] action as a [[Action Xphb]] for the spell's duration.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d8` for each spell slot level above 4.

**Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]
