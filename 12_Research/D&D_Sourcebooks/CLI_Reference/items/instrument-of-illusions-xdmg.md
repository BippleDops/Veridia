# Instrument of Illusions
*Wondrous item, common*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/instrument-of-illusions.webp#right)


While you are playing this [[musical-instrument-xphb|musical instrument]], you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to create harmless, illusory visual effects within a 5-foot [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] originating from the instrument. If you are a Bard, the size of the [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] increases to 15 feet. Sample visual effects include luminous musical notes, a spectral dancer, butterflies, and gently falling snow. The magical effects have neither substance nor sound, and they are obviously illusory. The effects end when you stop playing.
