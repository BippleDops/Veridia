## Overview

Captain Thorne Blackwater was once among the most respected naval officers in the Tidecaller Navy, commanding the frigate *Storm's Justice* with honor and distinction. His fleet patrolled the dangerous waters between the civilized ports and the wild reaches of the Tidecaller Archipelago, protecting merchant vessels from pirates and sea monsters alike. However, three months ago, Blackwater and his entire crew vanished during what should have been a routine patrol. The Navy declared them lost at sea, but rumors persist that Blackwater turned pirate himself.

Recent reports have surfaced of a ship matching the *Storm's Justice*'s description attacking merchant vessels in the outer waters. The attacks show unusual patterns - no lives are lost, and only specific cargo is taken, suggesting insider knowledge of shipping manifests. Admiral Coralia Deepstorm of the Tidecaller Navy has privately commissioned the party to investigate these troubling reports and discover the truth behind Captain Blackwater's fate. The admiral fears that either one of her most trusted officers has turned traitor, or something far more sinister has befallen him and his crew.

The quest will take the party through the political intrigue of Port Maelstrom's naval district, into the lawless waters of the outer archipelago, and ultimately to a confrontation that will determine not just Blackwater's fate, but the future of naval authority in the region. The truth behind his disappearance connects to larger conspiracies involving corrupt port officials, ancient sea curses, and the delicate balance of power between law and chaos on the high seas.

### Marcus Tidwell
*Medium humanoid (human), neutral*

**Background**: A low-level Port Authority clerk who got in over his head selling information. Genuinely believed he was helping a legitimate naval operation.

**Goals**: Survive the investigation, make reparations for his actions, protect his family

**Stats**: Use **Commoner** statistics with enhanced Investigation and Deception skills

### World Impact
- Successful completion strengthens legitimate government authority
- Failure allows Depth Touched influence to spread unchecked
- Character actions determine the future balance between law and chaos
