--- # Summon Aberration

*4th-level, Conjuration* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/summon-aberration.webp#right) - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pickled tentacle and an eyeball in a platinum-inlaid vial worth 400+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour You call forth an aberrant spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the [[Aberrant Spirit Xphb]] stat block. When you cast the spell, choose Beholderkin, Mind Flayer, or Slaad. The creature resembles an Aberration of that kind, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] or when the spell ends. The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, it shares your [[Initiative Xphb]] count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [[actions#Dodge|Dodge]] action and uses its movement to avoid danger. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block. **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 322* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Summon aberration xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of summon aberration xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around summon aberration xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Alliance - Manipulate succession ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## Spell Components Detail
