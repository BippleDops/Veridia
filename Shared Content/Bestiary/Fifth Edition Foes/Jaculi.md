## Description
Jaculi average 8 feet long, but they can grow to a length of 12 feet. Its natural coloration is a deep green with dark brown stripes across its back; its underbelly is light gray.

Jaculi typically find a hiding spot high up in trees or on a rock wall above a pathway or game trail, then wait for prey to stroll beneath them. The jaculi then drops silently onto its victim and bites.
