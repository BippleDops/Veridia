## Traits

### Creature Type

You are Undead.

### Brittle Bones

You are vulnerable to bludgeoning damage.

### Undead Nature

You are immune to poison damage and [exhaustion](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Exhaustion), and you can't be [poisoned](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned). You don't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

### Darkvision

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Languages

You can't speak, but you can understand the languages you knew in life.

## Player-Facing Summary

Skeleton dmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of skeleton dmg as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around skeleton dmg.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties skeleton dmg to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at skeleton dmg to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to skeleton dmg active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
