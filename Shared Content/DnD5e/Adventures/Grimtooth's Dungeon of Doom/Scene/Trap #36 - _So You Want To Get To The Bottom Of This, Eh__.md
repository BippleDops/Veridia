# Trap #36 - "So You Want To Get To The Bottom Of This, Eh?"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> To avoid a long description, the door on the left leads to a shaft and the ladder arrangement exactly the same in appearance to the one behind the door on the right. There are two differences. The first is that the shaft behind this door is 200 feet deep, and the second is that there is no vat of oil at the top of this ladder. As with [[Trap #35 - _Common Guys Get A Grip!_|Trap #35]], the party will in all likelihood be reluctant to just jump oveund grab a rung. With patience and careful coaxing they will eventually work up the requisite nerve to perch themselves on the ladder. They will be sure of some doom befalling them on the ladder, so this time there is a surprise in store for them. The trap is at rhe bottom. After an agonizing descent the party will find itself within 10 feet of the bottom of the shaft when they run out of ladder. The party must drop to the floor below. The first weight that hits the 10 by 10 foot space at the bottom of the shaft sets the trap for the next. (Ideally the party will have dropped something down the shaft as a test and really cooked their own geese.) 
> 
> When the second weight hits the bottom of the shaft the 10 by 10 floor panel will explode upward with great force! When the first weight hit the panel, it locked in place. Into a room below the panel, was vented water from the supply that honeycombs the tomb area. This water comes into contact with another ofEvinrood's donnant fire elementals contained herein. The water is converted to live steam, as the elemental is annihilated. Then the second weight trips the release that causes the panel to be blown back up the shaft by the force of the steam explosion. When the panel hits the ladder, parts of both will become shrapnel flying back up the shaft. 
> 
> There is a 10% chance (L10) of someone on the plate surviving. Delvers still on the ladder have a 10% better chance (L9, L8, and so on) for each 10 feet up the ladder they are located at the time of the explosion. (Thus someone still at the top will have a 70% chance of not being hit by debris, and, or dislodged to plummet to the room below.) The ladder will be ruined by all this, and certain members of the party as well!

> Four big skulls for this one, death is not only likely, but probable for at least one of the tomb robbers! It's a great way to give the delvers the shaft...
