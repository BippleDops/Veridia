--- # Raise Dead

*5th-level, Necromancy* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/raise-dead.webp#right) - **Casting time:** 1 hour
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a diamond worth 500+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous With a touch, you revive a dead creature if it has been dead no longer than 10 days and it wasn't Undead when it died. The creature returns to life with 1 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]]. This spell also neutralizes any poisons that affected the creature at the time of death. This spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn't restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral for its survivalâ€”its head, for instanceâ€”the spell automatically fails. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a -4 penalty to [[d20-test-xphb (variant-rules)]]. Every time the target finishes a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]], the penalty is reduced by 1 until it becomes 0. **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 310.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of raise dead xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around raise dead xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A corpse reveals a betrayal about a local noble
