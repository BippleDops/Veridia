## Description

He is old and decrepit, garbed in ancient finery worn to tatters. A dented crown rests on his brow, and one of his horns ends in a jagged stump. He drags a rusty greataxe in the dirt, and tied to his back is a 30-pound, clay amphora painted with images of warring hoplitesâ€”all of whom have had horns crudely painted on them to make them look like minotaurs. The broad-mouthed amphora is large enough to hold roughly 55 gallons of wine.

He claims that he was a great king who was cursed by Mogis after he defied his war advisors by making his sickly but beloved child his heir. He was cast out and has since become tragically obsessed with finding a worthy heir.
