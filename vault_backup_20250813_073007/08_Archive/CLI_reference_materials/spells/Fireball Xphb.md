# Fireball
*3rd-level, Evocation*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/fireball.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a ball of bat guano and sulfur)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A bright streak flashes from you to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into a fiery explosion. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]] centered on that point makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `8d6` Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried start [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/traps-hazards/burning-xphb|burning]].

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d6` for each spell slot level above 3.

Fireball xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of fireball xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around fireball xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties fireball xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at fireball xphb to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to fireball xphb active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
