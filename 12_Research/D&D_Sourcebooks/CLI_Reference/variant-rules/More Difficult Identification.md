# More Difficult Identification
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 136* 

If you prefer magic items to have a greater mystique, consider removing the ability to identify the properties of a magic item during a short rest, and require the [[identify-xphb|identify]] spell, experimentation, or both to reveal what a magic item does.

## Player-Facing Summary

More difficult identification is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of more difficult identification as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around more difficult identification.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties more difficult identification to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at more difficult identification to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to more difficult identification active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
