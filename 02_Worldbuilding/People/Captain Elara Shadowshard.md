### Special Abilities

**Legendary Resistance (2/Day).** If Elara fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Shadow-Touched Evolution.** Elara's exposure to the Obsidian Shard has granted her supernatural abilities that grow stronger with time. Her shadow-touched nature intensifies during times of stress or proximity to shadow magic.

**Shadow Step.** As a bonus action, Elara can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space she can see that is in dim light or darkness. She has advantage on the first melee attack she makes after using this feature.

**Shadow Whispers.** Elara can communicate telepathically with shadow creatures and shadow-touched beings within 120 feet. She can also sense their general emotional state and hostile intentions.

**Obsidian Hunger.** Elara's obsession with claiming the Obsidian Shard intensifies under stress. When reduced to half her hit points or lower, she gains advantage on all attack rolls and saving throws, but must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each turn or be compelled to move toward the nearest source of shadow magic.

**Combat Leadership.** Elara's military training allows her to coordinate her allies effectively. As a bonus action, she can grant one ally within 60 feet who can see and hear her advantage on their next attack roll.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Elara makes three attacks: two with her Shadow Scimitars and one Shadow Bolt, or three Shadow Scimitar attacks.

**Shadow Scimitar.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (1d6 + 8) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. If the target is in bright light, Elara has disadvantage on this attack.

**Shadow Bolt.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +10 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (3d6 + 6) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of their next turn as shadows whisper terrible truths.

**Shadow Veil (Recharge 5-6).** Elara wraps herself in writhing shadows. For 1 minute, she has advantage on Stealth checks, attacks against her have disadvantage, and she can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. She takes 5 (1d10) force damage if she ends her turn inside an object.

**Company Rally (1/Day).** Elara calls out tactical commands that inspire her Shadow Company. Up to 6 allies within 60 feet who can hear her gain 15 temporary hit points, advantage on their next attack roll, and can immediately move up to their speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Shadow Bind (1/Day).** Elara targets a creature within 60 feet, attempting to bind them with animated shadows. The target must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they are restrained by shadow tendrils for 1 minute and take 9 (2d8) necrotic damage at the start of each of their turns. The target can repeat the save at the end of each turn, ending the effect on a success.

### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)
Elara can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.

**Move.** Elara moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks, potentially using shadow step.

**Shadow Strike.** Elara makes one Shadow Scimitar attack.

**Tactical Command.** Elara shouts a command to one ally within 60 feet, allowing them to make one weapon attack as a reaction.

**Shadow Bolt (Costs 2 Actions).** Elara makes one Shadow Bolt attack.

**Company Maneuver (Costs 3 Actions).** Elara and up to 3 allies within 30 feet can immediately move up to their speed and make one weapon attack each.

### Lair Actions (When with Shadow Company)
When leading her company in familiar shadow-touched territory, Elara can take lair actions on initiative count 20:

**Shadow Ambush.** Shadows deepen around the battlefield. All creatures except Elara and her company must succeed on a DC 15 Perception check or be surprised until the end of their next turn.

**Whispered Intelligence.** Shadow creatures report enemy movements to Elara. She learns the exact position and general health status of all creatures within 300 feet.
