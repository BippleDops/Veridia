# Ascender
## Overview
Ascender/Slider: This cleverly designed ratchet wraps around ropes and assists climbing and descending. By clicking a small switch, the ratchet prevents [[2 - Movement|movement]] either up or down the rope. This grants a +1 circumstance bonus on Climb checks using a single rope. You can also slide down a rope with this device, which allows rapid [[2 - Movement|movement]]â€”basically a controlled fall. It requires a successful Strength Check (DC 15) to hold on when performing this maneuver. A failure means you fall.

**Cost:** 20gp

**Weight:** 1lb.
