# Throbbing Bones (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, M (a small bone that you snap in half)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
You choose one target you can see within range. That creatureâ€™s bones begin to throb and pulsate. Plants, oozes, and other creatures that do not have bones (or other creatures that only have cartilage or an exoskeleton) are immune to this spell.

The pain the creature suffers due to this spell causes it to be at disadvantage for all attack rolls and ability checks, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet. In addition, the target must make a Constitution saving throw each round. The creature takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.
