## Description
The cities of the savage frontier, including Silverymoon, Mirabar, and Sundabar have a unique way of storing unshelled [[Nuts|nuts]]—they mix them into their first-rate cheeses. The nut cheeses of the north are rich, hard cheeses, worth trying in their own right. Hickory [[Nuts|nuts]], walnut, and chestnuts are ground and mixed throughout the cheese, and the entire wheel is left to ripen. A variety is available, so if you want one from a particular town, say so on the order, otherwise we’ll send you a mixed lot. Variety is the spice of life! Available in 2 lb wheels (1 gp) or 100 lb elliptical wheys (50 gp).
