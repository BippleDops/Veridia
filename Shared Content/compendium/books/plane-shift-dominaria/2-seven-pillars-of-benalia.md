# Seven Pillars of Benalia
*Source: Plane Shift: Dominaria, p. 5* 

Benalia is a land of natural and architectural beauty: vast fields of sun-kissed grain crisscrossed by meandering rivers and dotted with cities of white limestone towers and vivid stained glass. One would hardly guess that less than a century before, this great empire was fractured, its people scattered, and its shining capital city a salt-choked ruin. Today, the seven noble houses of Benalia once again rule one of the most prosperous and powerful nations of Dominaria. The Benalish are keenly aware that their New Benalia is in its infancy, with a thousand years of heroic ancestors and tales of bravery to live up to. But they are a diligent people—and proud enough to consider themselves equal to the task.

## Heroes of Benalia

Benalia is an empire poised for expansion, and many of its greatest heroes are part of its strong and growing array of military forces.

- **Alignment.** Usually lawful, often good
- **Races.** [Human](/compendium/races/human.md), [Aven](/compendium/races/aven-psd.md)
- **Suggested Backgrounds.** [Acolyte](/compendium/backgrounds/acolyte.md), [Noble](/compendium/backgrounds/noble.md), [Sage](/compendium/backgrounds/sage.md) (House Tarmula), [Sailor](/compendium/backgrounds/sailor.md) (House Deniz), [Soldier](/compendium/backgrounds/soldier.md)

### Suggested Classes

Consider any of the following class options for a Benalish character.

#### {@class Cleric}

The priests who march with the armies of Benalia are consecrated by the Serran church—and are technically part of its ecclesiastical hierarchy. In practice, though, they serve more as military officers than as clergy. Benalish clerics inspire their charges to great feats of glory and heroism, bolstering them with the blessings of Serra.

#### {@class Fighter}

Benalish fighters drawn from the noble houses are often elite knights. They are responsible for security for Benalish lords and their manors, and make up the core of military forces in the field. Noble fighters also serve as officers for the soldiery, but many people from the common classes also rise to officer ranks. Each of the noble houses maintains its own standing army, but several legions of professional soldiers tithed from the different houses make up the backbone of the Benalish fighting force.

#### {@class Paladin}

Warriors who combine loyalty to Benalia with devotion to Serra might join the ranks of Benalia's knights if they come from noble blood. This is particularly true of the members of House Capashen, who have a long heritage of worshiping Serra.

#### {@class Ranger}

The leather-clad Benalish warriors known colloquially as "heroes" make up a special, renowned class of defender. They are trained from a young age to survive in any environment while operating independently, and they owe their loyalty directly to Benalia City and the Council of Seven.

### Benalish Sites

Like much of Dominaria, Benalia is dotted with the ruins of ancient empires and scarred by long-ago wars. First built on the ashes of the ancient Sheoltun Empire, it was ravaged by the Phyrexian Invasion, then rebuilt over the rubble of its own near-destruction.

|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | A lost Sheoltun temple of the state-sponsored Church of Angelfire |

| 4 | A wrecked Phyrexian portal-ship, long overgrown by nature |
| 5 | The remains of a castle that sank in a mire during the Years of Salt |

### Benalish Villains

When evil arises in the realm of Benalia, it often takes the form of that most dangerous of villains: the kind that believe themselves to be righteous and good. They might use villainous methods to advance what are basically good ends, or grow so zealous in their fight against evil that they begin to see it everywhere.

**Benalish Villains**

| dice: d8 | Villain |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A zealous warrior wants to lead an army to war against Keld. |
| 2 | A house leader wants their house to be the Highest House several years ahead of schedule. |
| 3 | A suspicious noble joins forces with a fiery Serran priest to try to root out corruption and the taint of the Cabal from the populace, with many innocents getting hurt in the process. |
| 4 | A hotheaded aven demands that their people gain immediate representation on the Council of Seven. |
| 5 | A pious noble seeks to bring the entire Church of Serra under Benalish control, combining church and state into a theocratic empire. |
| 6 | One member of the Council of Seven has a long-standing grudge against another. |
| 7 | A skin-witch of the Caligo Morass brings a nearby area under a curse. |
| 8 | An important noble has fallen under the influence of an advisor with ties to the Cabal, and is advancing the Cabal's plans without knowing it. |
