Their path is one of untrammeled fury, and they thrill in the chaos of battle as they allow their Rage to seize and empower them. ### Frenzy (Level 3) If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active, you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on your turn with a Strength-based attack. To determine the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. The damage has the same type as the weapon or [[Unarmed Strike Xphb used for the attack. ### Mindless Rage (Level 6) You have [immunity-xphb (variant-rules)]] to the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed and [conditions#frightened|Frightened]] conditions while your Rage is active. If you're [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed or [conditions#frightened|Frightened]] when you enter your Rage, the condition ends on you. ### Retaliation (Level 10) When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can take a [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules) to make one melee attack against that creature, using a weapon or an [Unarmed Strike Xphb]]. ### Intimidating Presence (Level 14) As a [[Action Xphb, you can strike terror into others with your menacing presence and primal power. When you do so, each creature of your choice in a 30-foot [Area of Effect Xphb]] originating from you must make a Wisdom saving throw (**DC 8** plus your Strength modifier and [[Proficiency Xphb). On a failed save, a creature has the [conditions#frightened|Frightened]] condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the [[conditions#frightened|Frightened creature's turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a [long-rest-xphb]] unless you expend a use of your Rage (no action required) to restore your use of it. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Barbarian xphb path of the berserker xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
