## Special Traits

**Spell-like Abilities:** A burning dervish can use the following spell-like abilities, using Charisma as its casting ability (DC 12, attack +4). It doesn’t need material components to use these abilities.

- At Will: *fire bolt, produce flame*

- 3/day: *invisibility (self only)*

- 1/day: *enlarge/reduce, flaming sphere, plane shift (Elemental, Astral, or Material Planes)*

**Elemental Endurance:** Burning dervishes can survive on the Elemental Planes of Air or Earth for up to 48 hours and on the Elemental Plane of Water for up to 12 hours. Failure to return to the Elemental Plane of Fire after that time deals 1 point of damage per hour to a burning dervish until it dies or returns to the Elemental Plane of Fire.

**Flame Form (3/Day):** Three times per day, a burning dervish can use its action to change its form to that of a column of fire. In this form it can attack with its fists. The transformation lasts indefinitely; changing back requires another action.

## Actions

**Multiattack:** The burning dervish attacks once with its falchion or twice with fists (fist attacks are possible only in flame form).

**Falchion:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (`dice: 2d8+4`) slashing damage.

**Fist:** *Melee Weapon Attack (Flame Form Only):* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (`dice: 1d10+4`) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (`dice: 1d6`) fire damage.

## Ecology

**Environment**: Elemental plane of fire

**Organization**: Solitary, company (2–4), or band (6–15)

## Description

Burning dervishes are the fanatical minions of the Sultan of Efreet (see the City of Brass by Necromancer Games). It is said that the burning dervishes were once a noble tribe of jann who sold their souls to the Sultan of Efreet in exchange for greater power over the Elemental Plane of Fire.

Burning dervishes are virtually indistinguishable from human. They spend a great amount of time in the Material Plane as agents of the Sultan of Efreet, seeking to spread worship of the Sultan as the true god of Elemental Fire. They also operate as assassins and spies, often leading daring surprise attacks against foes of the Sultan or procuring powerful relics for his pleasure.

The burning dervishes have a citadel atop the Great Ziggurat of the City of Brass that serves as the central temple to their zealous faith. It is from this ziggurat that the Sultan communes with his worshippers, sending them out on raids throughout the planes to further his name and power.

Burning dervishes usually turn themselves invisible before attacking, the better to catch their foes by surprise. In combat, a burning dervish usually fights with its falchion. Depending on the power of its opponent, the burning dervish can either use enlarge on itself or reduce on its opponent. A burning dervish that is outclassed or overmatched either takes to the air and flies away or attempts to plane shift to safety.
