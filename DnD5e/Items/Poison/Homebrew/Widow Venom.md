# Widow Venom
## Overview
Widow Venom (contact). Start with Wyrmtongue Petals like all poisons, and mix in some Amanita Cap with a little bit of Cactus Juice. After that, add some Spineflower Berries. This [[Poisoned|poison]] has a Alchemy Attempt DC of 17. The resulting mixture should be a slime-like red substance that has fuzzy bits of the Amanita Cap exposed. When used appropriately, the target it is used on becomes [[Poisoned|poisoned]] for 1 minute, takes `dice: 1d6` + Alchemy Modifier [[Poisoned|poison]] damage per round, and doesnâ€™t notice the effects until 30 seconds pass. Additionally, the [[Poisoned|poison]] will only [[Knock|knock]] the target [[Unconscious|unconscious]], not kill them.
