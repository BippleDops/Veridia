## Overview
The Vanishing Depths represent one of the most dangerous and unpredictable regions in all of [[Aquabyssos - an area where reality itself becomes unstable, constantly shifting between different states of existence. Sometimes the water is there, sometimes it isn't. Sometimes gravity works normally, other times it flows sideways or upward. The area appears to be the result of dimensional tears caused by [The Great Drowning]], where the barriers between planes of existence have worn dangerously thin.

### Temporal Fluctuation
Time moves inconsistently throughout the Depths. Some areas experience time at normal speed, while others may see centuries pass in moments or a single second stretch into hours. Explorers have reported meeting versions of themselves from different time periods, or finding ruins of expeditions that haven't been launched yet.

### Spatial Distortion
The physical space of the Vanishing Depths doesn't follow normal rules. Distances change based on the observer's expectations, intention, or emotional state. Swimming "forward" might lead deeper, higher, or to a completely different location entirely. Maps become useless as the topology shifts constantly.

### Reality Shifts
The fundamental nature of what exists in the Depths changes unpredictably. Water might become solid, air, fire, or pure energy. Gravity might reverse, increase dramatically, or become selective about what it affects. The laws of magic fluctuate, sometimes enhancing spells beyond recognition or causing them to fail completely.

### Dimensional Bleeding
Other planes of existence leak through into the Depths, creating pockets of alien environments. Explorers might find themselves swimming through the Elemental Plane of Fire, walking through the Shadowfell, or breathing underwater in what appears to be a surface meadow.

### The Probability Gardens
Areas where multiple versions of the same location exist simultaneously. Travelers might see a coral reef that is simultaneously blooming, dying, newly grown, and ancient. Each version is equally real, and observers can sometimes shift between them through focused will or magical intervention.

### The Echo Zones
Regions where past events replay constantly, sometimes overlapping with present events. These echoes can be observed, interacted with, or even changed, potentially altering history. However, any changes tend to create paradoxes that make the reality instability worse.

### The  Spheres
Perfectly spherical areas where nothing exists - not water, not air, not space itself. These voids seem to absorb anything that touches them, but occasionally spit out objects or creatures from completely different times and places. Some scholars believe these are wounds in reality that may never heal.

### The Crystallized Moments
Sections where time has become solid, visible as crystalline structures that can be examined and sometimes entered. Inside these crystals, observers can witness frozen moments from the past or possible futures, but risk becoming trapped themselves if they stay too long.

### The Possibility Mazes
Labyrinthine structures that exist only as potential - they become real when observed and disappear when unobserved. Each path through the maze represents a different possible outcome of some cosmic event, and choosing different routes can influence which possibilities become reality.

### The Constant Explorers
**[[Navigator Flux Timewalker**: A researcher who has been exploring the Depths for subjective centuries but only minutes of real time. They exist partially outside normal time and can provide guidance, though their advice often relates to events that haven't happened yet.

**[The Probability Merchant]]**: A trader who exists in multiple realities simultaneously, selling items that might exist, once existed, or will exist. They accept payment in possibilities, memories, or temporal paradoxes rather than conventional currency.

### The Reality Refugees
People and creatures from other dimensions who became trapped in the Depths when reality shifts connected their home planes to this area. They include:

- **Solar Angels** from the Celestial Plane, desperately trying to return home
- **Shadow Folk** who were pulled from the Shadowfell and now fear the light
- **Elemental Outcasts** who exist as living contradictions (fire that burns cold, earth that floats, etc.)
- **Time Wraiths** - former explorers who died in temporal anomalies but continue existing outside normal time

### The Dimensional Scavengers
Creatures that have adapted to feed on reality distortions themselves. These include:

**Reality Eaters**: Shark-like beings that devour stable space-time, leaving void in their wake
**Paradox Parasites**: Tiny creatures that multiply when they encounter logical contradictions
**Possibility Spiders**: Web-spinning entities that trap potential futures in crystalline nets

### The Lost Expedition
An entire research team from [[New Tethys that has been missing for three years, though they experience it as three hours. They've established a base camp in a relatively stable pocket and are desperately trying to map safe routes out while conducting valuable research on dimensional mechanics.

### Reality Sickness
Prolonged exposure to unstable reality causes a condition where affected individuals begin to experience their own inconsistencies. Symptoms include:
- **Phase 1**: Forgetting which version of events actually happened
- **Phase 2**: Experiencing multiple personalities from different timelines
- **Phase 3**: Existing in several locations simultaneously
- **Phase 4**: Complete dissolution into probability (effective death)

### Temporal Paradoxes
Actions taken in the Depths can create paradoxes that damage both the individual and reality itself. Meeting yourself, preventing your own past actions, or learning information you shouldn't know can cause:
- Immediate psychic damage (`dice: 3d6` per paradox severity)
- Permanent ability score reduction
- Erasure from history (character ceases to have existed)
- Creation of hostile temporal duplicates

### Dimensional Displacement
Without warning, explorers might find themselves transported to other planes of existence. The most dangerous displacements include:
- **The Positive Energy Plane**: Instantly fatal to most living beings
- **The Negative Energy Plane**: Drains life force continuously
- **The Far Realm**: Causes immediate madness and mutation
- **Parallel Aquabyssos**: Similar but wrong versions of familiar places

### Reality Storms
Massive disturbances where multiple types of instability converge, creating chaotic zones of pure impossibility. During these events:
- Spells cast have completely random effects
- Physical laws change every round
- Creatures may be duplicated, erased, or transformed
- Time flows in multiple directions simultaneously

### Instability Checks
Every hour in the Depths, characters must make a Wisdom save (**DC 15** + hours spent) or suffer an instability effect:

**1-5: Minor Shift** - Advantage or disadvantage on next roll
**6-10: Moderate Distortion** - Spell slot lost or recovered randomly
**11-15: Major Anomaly** - Temporary ability score change
**16-19: Reality Break** - Character displaced `dice: 1d100` feet in random direction
**20+: Dimensional Rift** - Character transported to different plane for `dice: 1d4` rounds

### Magic Instability
Spellcasting in the Depths is unpredictable:
- Roll d20 when casting: 1-5 spell fails, 6-15 normal effect, 16-20 enhanced/altered effect
- Spell slots might not be consumed (10% chance) or might consume extra slots (15% chance)
- Wild Magic effects occur 25% more often
- Spells from different schools may spontaneously combine

### Navigation Rules
Movement in the Depths doesn't follow normal rules:
- Survival checks (**DC 20**) required to move in intended direction
- Failed navigation can lead anywhere in the Depths or beyond
- Returning to previously visited locations requires increasingly difficult checks
- Magical navigation aids malfunction 60% of the time

### Probability Crystals
Crystallized moments of choice that can be shattered to reroll any die result. Each crystal contains a specific decision point from history and using it slightly alters the timeline. Extremely valuable but dangerous to collect in large quantities.

### Temporal Anchors
Devices that create small zones of stable time and space, essential for safe exploration. These rare artifacts were created before [The Great Drowning]] and cannot be replicated with current magical knowledge.

### Reality Compasses
Instruments that point toward stable reality rather than magnetic north. They help navigators avoid the worst instabilities but sometimes point in impossible directions like "up through time" or "sideways into yesterday."

### The Paradox Engine
A legendary artifact supposedly hidden in the deepest, most unstable part of the Depths. It allegedly allows the user to resolve any paradox, undo any timeline, or stabilize reality permanently - but using it might unmake the user's existence entirely.

### Dimensional Pearls
Pearls that contain entire pocket dimensions where refugees from collapsed realities have made their homes. Each pearl is a complete world in miniature, inhabited by beings who exist nowhere else in the multiverse.

### [[The Primordial Vaults
Some believe the Vanishing Depths are connected to the deepest levels of the Vaults, where reality was first damaged. Temporal explorers occasionally report finding passages that lead between the two locations.

### [New Tethys]]
The city's research institutions send regular (though carefully planned) expeditions to study the Depths. The knowledge gained has advanced their understanding of memory magic and dimensional theory significantly.

### [[Aethermoor
Reality tears occasionally connect the Depths to the surface world, creating brief portals that allow limited travel between realms. These connections are unpredictable and extremely dangerous to use.

### [The Hadal Depths]]
The boundary between the Vanishing Depths and the Hadal Depths is unclear, as both locations exist partially outside normal reality. Some scholars believe they may be the same place viewed from different dimensional perspectives.

### The Stabilization Project
**Level**: 13-17
[[New Tethys scientists believe they've found a way to permanently stabilize a section of the Depths, but they need adventurers to place quantum anchors at specific coordinates that keep changing as reality shifts.

### The Paradox Investigation
**Level**: 11-15
Someone has been deliberately creating temporal paradoxes in the Depths, and the resulting instabilities threaten to spread to stable areas. The party must identify and stop the perpetrator while navigating an increasingly chaotic environment.

### The Rescue Mission Recursive
**Level**: 9-14
A rescue expedition to find the Lost Expedition has itself gone missing. The party must find both groups while dealing with the fact that their rescue mission may create a temporal loop that traps them as well.

### The Reality War
**Level**: 15-18
Two factions of dimensional refugees are fighting for control of the most stable areas in the Depths. Their conflict is making the instabilities worse and threatening to tear open permanent rifts to hostile dimensions.

### The Temporal Heist
**Level**: 12-16
A valuable artifact was lost in the Depths decades ago, but temporal distortions mean it can still be retrieved from the past. The party must navigate to the right time period, steal the item, and return without creating paradoxes.

## Random Encounters (d12)
1. **Reality Storm Approaching**: Environmental hazard affecting all natural laws
2. **Temporal Echo**: Ghostly repetition of a past event with which characters can interact
3. **Dimension Rift**: Portal to random plane opens for `dice: 1d4` rounds
4. **The Same Explorer**: Party member's past/future self approaches with cryptic warnings
5. **Possibility Cascade**: Multiple versions of the same event happen simultaneously
6. **Paradox Parasite Swarm**: Creatures feeding on logical contradictions
7. **Crystallized Moment**: Time crystal showing important past/future event
8. **Reality Refugee Camp**: Displaced beings from other dimensions seeking help
9. ** Sphere Drift**: Area of non-existence moving through the water
10. **The Probability Merchant**: Mysterious trader offering impossible goods
11. **Dimensional Scavenger Hunt**: Reality Eaters threaten stable pockets of space
12. **Temporal Loop**: Party repeats same actions until they can break the cycle

### Dimensional Studies
The Depths provide unparalleled opportunities to study the fundamental nature of reality, space, and time. Researchers from across [Aquabyssos]] come here despite the dangers to advance their understanding of:
- Planar mechanics and dimensional travel
- The relationship between magic and reality
- Time travel theory and temporal paradox resolution
- The aftereffects of massive magical catastrophes

### Historical Preservation
The temporal anomalies in the Depths preserve moments from throughout history, including events from before [[The Great Drowning]]. This makes the area invaluable for historians and archaeologists willing to brave its dangers.

## Secrets
> [!warning] DM Only
> - The Vanishing Depths are slowly expanding as reality becomes less stable over time
> - [[The Great Drowning]] was not a single event but an ongoing temporal paradox centered here
> - One of the  Spheres contains the original timeline where the drowning never happened
> - The Paradox Engine is actually a person - someone who became so unstable they can alter reality through will alone
> - Every creature that dies in the Depths creates a new dimensional fracture, making the problem progressively worse

## Adventure Integration Tips
