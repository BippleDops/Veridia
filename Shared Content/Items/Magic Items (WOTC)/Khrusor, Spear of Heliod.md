## Description

Heliod wields Khrusor, a spear blessed with the power of the sun. In his hands, it can be pitched from Nyx to any point on Theros. When Heliod lends his weapon to a mortal, it's typically so they can perform some great work in his name or as a test of their worthiness. # Spear of the Sun 

This spear grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When you hit with an attack using this spear, the target takes an extra `dice: 2d8` radiant damage.

**Blessing of the Sun** If you are a worshiper of Heliod, you gain all the following benefits for which you have the required piety:

**Piety 3+.** You gain 15 temporary hit points each dawn.

**Piety 10+.** The spear has 1 randomly determined [[Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|minor beneficial]] property.

**Piety 25+.** The spear has 1 additional randomly determined [[Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|minor beneficial]] property.

**Piety 50+.** The spear has 1 randomly determined [[Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|major beneficial]] property.

If you aren't a worshiper of Heliod, the spear has 2 randomly determined [[Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties|major detrimental]] properties.

See "Artifacts" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for details on randomly determined properties.

**Luminous** The spear sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The light is sunlight.

**Sun's Retaliation** When you take damage from a creature within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee attack with the spear against that creature. On a hit, the spear deals damage as normal, and the creature is [[Blinded]] until the start of its next turn. This property of the spear can't be used again until the next dawn.

**Spells** The spear has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: [[guiding bolt]]  (1 charge), [[daylight]] (3 charges, targeting the tip of the spear only), [[sunbeam]] (6 charges). The spear regains `dice: 1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn.

**Destroying the Spear** If taken to Erebos's palace in Tizerus, and used to sacrifice a champion of Heliod to Erebos, Khrusor is either destroyed or fundamentally twisted to Erebos's service.

**Thrown.** If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
