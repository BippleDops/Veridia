# New Thalassopolis

*"We built our new city in the corpse of the old, and sometimes, in the deep night, you can still hear it breathing."*

## Overview
New Thalassopolis, the de facto capital of [[Aquabyssos]], is a haunting merger of drowned architecture and new construction, built within and around the sunken ruins of the original surface metropolis. The city exists in the Twilight Depth, where the last rays of sunlight create an eternal blue-green dusk, and bioluminescent organisms provide additional illumination.

## City Structure

### The Rings of Depth
The city is organized in concentric rings, each deeper than the last:

#### The Air Ring (Outermost)
- Contains precious air pockets maintained by magic
- Embassy quarter for surface dwellers
- Transformation chambers for new arrivals
- Markets for surface goods
- The Breathing Gardens (air-filled domes with surface plants)

#### The Twilight Ring
- Main residential areas for the Pelagic class
- Grand marketplace and trade centers
- Temple of Drowning Truths
- Academy of Deep Magic
- Memory Exchange banks

#### The Pressure Ring
- Military districts and training grounds
- Forges that use pressure instead of heat
- Benthic class workshops and homes
- The Depth Guard barracks
- Coral farms and kelp plantations

#### The Shadow Ring
- Government buildings and noble estates
- The Tidal Council chambers
- Ancient libraries from the original city
- Restricted magical research facilities
- Entrances to the Midnight Depth

#### The Core (Center)
- The Obsidian Palace (when Empress is visiting)
- The Original Sin monument
- The Depth Clock tower
- Portal to other parts of Aquabyssos
- The Memory Vaults

## Notable Locations

### The Drowned Cathedral
Once Thalassopolis's greatest temple, now a center of dark worship:
- Filled with "breathing water" that sustains both air and water breathers
- Stained glass windows that show different scenes based on depth pressure
- Altar that transforms offerings into memories
- Bells that still ring, creating bubbles that carry prayers

### The Memory Exchange
The city's economic heart where memories are traded as currency:
- Extraction chambers for memory removal
- Valuation experts who price experiences
- Memory vaults storing millions of experiences
- Black market for forbidden or stolen memories
- Connection to surface world memory smuggling

### The Inverted Towers
Skyscrapers from the original city that now hang upside down:
- Gravity works differently inside each tower
- Noble families claim different towers
- Some towers phase between existence and void
- The tallest tower's "top" (now bottom) reaches the Hadean Depth

### The Coral Palace
Secondary seat of government when the Empress is elsewhere:
- Built from transformed bodies of drowning victims
- Whispers prophecies through the walls
- Grows larger with each death in the city

### The Academy of Deep Magic
Where the transformed learn to manipulate reality:
- Pressure chambers for spell practice
- Memory libraries containing centuries of knowledge
- Void swimming pools for advanced students

## DM Secrets
> [!danger] The City Lives
> New Thalassopolis isn't just built on the old city - the original city is still alive, transformed into a massive organism. The buildings are organs, the streets are veins, and the citizens are parasites or symbionts. It dreams, and those dreams affect reality.

> [!warning] The Convergence Point
> The city exists in multiple dimensions simultaneously. Versions of it exist at every depth, and they're slowly merging. When they fully converge, it will create a portal large enough to bring the Things That Dwell Beneath to the surface.

> [!info] The Memory Core
> Deep beneath the city is a crystallized mass of all memories from the original drowning. If accessed, it would grant godlike knowledge but would also overwhelm any mind, creating a new Thing That Dwells Beneath.
