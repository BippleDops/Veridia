## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region around a shadow dragon's lair is twisted by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Negative Energy Suffusion.** Whenever a creature within 1 mile of the lair regains [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] from a spell, it subtracts `d10` from the number of [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] regained.  
- **Stifling Shadows.** Within 1 mile of the lair, effects that normally create [[bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]] instead create [[dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]], and creatures there have [[advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on Dexterity ([[skills#Stealth|Stealth]]) checks.  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

## Player-Facing Summary

## Lore Details

Legends speak of shadow dragon xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around shadow dragon xmm.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
