*4th-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You conjure spirits from the Elemental Planes that flit around you in a 15-foot [Emanation](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) for the duration. Until the spell ends, any attack you make deals an extra `2d8` damage when you hit a creature in the [Emanation](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md). This damage is Acid, Cold, Fire, or Lightning (your choice when you make the attack).

In addition, the ground in the [Emanation](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) is [Difficult Terrain](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md) for your enemies.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d8` for each spell slot level above 4.

**Classes**: [Druid](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
