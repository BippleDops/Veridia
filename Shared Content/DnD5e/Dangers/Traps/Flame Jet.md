# Flame Jet
## Overview
*Mechanical trap*
Flame jets are small nozzles attached to a fuel source placed into stone floors. The trap is trigger by a hidden pressure plate. Any weight of more than 20 pounds placed on the pressure plate triggers the trap. The pressure plate can be spotted with a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check and the nozzle can be spotted with a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. A character studying the area can determine the pressure plate is a slightly different color than the rest of the floor with a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.

A creature who steps on the pressure plate must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw to avoid the sudden burst of flame which rises up from the floor. A creature who fails takes 5 (1d10) fire damage. A creature who succeeds takes half damage.
