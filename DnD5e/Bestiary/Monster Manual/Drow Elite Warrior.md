## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting.*** The drow's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: *dancing lights*
1/day each: *darkness, faerie fire, levitate (self only)*

***Fey Ancestry.*** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The drow makes two shortsword attacks.

***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d6+4`) piercing damage plus 10 (`dice: 3d6`) poison damage.

***Hand Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d6+4`) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

## Reactions
***Parry.*** The drow adds 3 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the drow must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

## Description
Drow elite warriors defend their houses and their superiors against all enemies, although they specialize in fighting dwarves, gnomes, and elves (including other drow). They frequently raid surface settlements under cover of night, returning to the Underdark with prisoners and spoils in tow before dawn.

Elite warriors can be male or female.

## Additional Details
**VARIANT: DROW MAGIC ARMOR AND WEAPONS** A drow elite warrior wearing +2 studded leather and carrying a +2 shortsword has AC 20 and a +2 bonus on attack and , damage rolls with shortsword attacks.
