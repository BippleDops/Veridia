--- # Reliquary Charm

*Charm* After spending a [[long-rest-xphb in your "Bastion", you gain a magical Charm (see ""Supernatural Gifts"" in "chapter 3") that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast [greater-restoration-xphb (spells)]] once without expending a spell slot or using Material components. You can't gain this Charm again while you still have it. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 344* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Reliquary charm xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
