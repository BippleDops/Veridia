## Overview

Known only as **The Memory Thief**, this enigmatic changeling operates as one of [[Aquabyssos' most skilled and dangerous practitioners of [Memory Manipulation]] magic, specializing in the extraction, modification, and theft of personal memories for both criminal and quasi-legitimate purposes. Their true identity remains unknown, hidden behind a constantly shifting array of false personas and carefully crafted illusions.

Working from the shadows of [[Abyssos Prime's underworld, The Memory Thief provides services ranging from helping trauma victims forget painful experiences to stealing valuable information from the minds of unwilling targets. Their reputation for discretion and effectiveness has made them both a sought-after specialist and a feared threat to anyone with secrets worth protecting.

The psychological and social implications of their work have made them a priority target for law enforcement while simultaneously creating a growing demand for their unique services.
