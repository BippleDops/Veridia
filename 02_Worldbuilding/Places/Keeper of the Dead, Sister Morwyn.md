# Keeper of the Dead, Sister Morwyn

*"Death is not the enemy - it is the final current that carries us home. I merely ensure that passage is peaceful and honored."*

## Overview

Sister Morwyn serves as the Keeper of the Dead for Aquabyssos, overseeing all funeral rites, maintaining the city's underwater cemetery, and ensuring proper spiritual care for the deceased and their families. Her role extends beyond traditional funeral services to include investigating suspicious deaths, dealing with undead threats, and providing counsel to those grieving or facing their own mortality.

As one of the most senior clerics in the Church of the Tidal Throne, Morwyn wields considerable influence in spiritual matters. Her neutral stance on political issues and her reputation for absolute discretion make her a trusted confidant for people from all walks of life, from common citizens to high-ranking officials.

Her duties have become increasingly complex as political tensions rise, with more suspicious deaths occurring and growing concerns about necromantic threats from the depths.

## Appearance

Sister Morwyn is a human woman in her late forties, with prematurely white hair that she keeps in a simple braid. Her face bears the serene expression of someone who has made peace with mortality, though her dark eyes reveal deep wisdom and compassion. She wears the traditional black and silver robes of her office, with a silver pendant shaped like a stylized whirlpool.

Her hands are gentle but strong, bearing small scars from years of preparing bodies for burial and handling the tools of her sacred duty. She moves with quiet dignity, her presence bringing comfort to the grieving and unease to those with guilty consciences.

## Background

Morwyn was called to serve the Church after experiencing prophetic dreams about the deaths of people in her village. Initially frightened by her visions, she learned to embrace them as a gift that allowed her to provide comfort and preparation to those facing death.

She came to Aquabyssos fifteen years ago to establish proper death rites for the growing city, as the underwater environment presented unique challenges for traditional burial practices. Her innovative solutions for underwater funeral rites have become the standard throughout the region.

Over the years, she has presided over thousands of funerals, from humble citizens to prominent officials, earning the trust and respect of all factions through her unwavering dedication to honoring the dead.

## Current Activities

Morwyn has been increasingly busy due to a rise in deaths related to the political tensions in the city. She's noticed patterns in recent deaths that suggest supernatural involvement - some bodies show signs of magical influence, while others seem to have been killed by methods that leave no obvious traces.

She's been conducting discrete investigations while maintaining her public duties, using her access to speak with the recently deceased to gather information about potential threats to the city.

## Relationships
- **Church of the Tidal Throne**: Senior cleric with specialized authority over death matters
- **All Factions**: Neutral service provider respected by all sides
- **City Guards**: Consulted on suspicious deaths and undead threats
- **Healer Sage Bondseer**: Professional colleague and trusted friend
- **Families of the Deceased**: Provides ongoing spiritual support and counsel

## Secrets
- Has spoken with several recently deceased who described being killed by "shadow figures"
- Maintains detailed records of death patterns that suggest organized assassination campaigns
- Discovered evidence of necromantic experiments being conducted somewhere in the city
- Knows the final words and secrets of many prominent citizens who have died recently

## Quest Hooks
1. Morwyn approaches the party after the dead begin delivering warnings about an upcoming supernatural threat to the city.
2. A series of suspicious deaths leads Morwyn to request the party's assistance in investigating a potential necromantic cult.
3. Morwyn needs protection while conducting a dangerous ritual to commune with victims of a recent mysterious plague.

## DM Notes
Morwyn serves as an excellent source of information about recent events, as she often learns secrets from the deceased that the living would never reveal. Her neutral status makes her a safe contact for all parties, while her connection to death magic provides unique plot opportunities involving undead, resurrection, and communication with the deceased.
