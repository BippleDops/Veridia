# Aurelius Goldwave
*The Golden Current Beneath Still Waters*

## Overview

Aurelius Goldwave presents himself as [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos's most successful independent financial consultant, a brilliant merfolk whose golden scales seem to shimmer with the promise of prosperity. Behind this carefully cultivated facade lies one of the most dangerous financial manipulators in the underwater realm—a being who has spent decades weaving a web of economic control that extends throughout [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] and increasingly into the surface world of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor.

Operating from his luxurious offices in [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]]'s prestigious Financial District, Aurelius has built an empire based on information, influence, and the subtle corruption of memory magic. His clients believe they are receiving expert financial advice, unaware that their deepest secrets are being harvested, their memories subtly altered, and their wealth gradually siphoned into accounts controlled by the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Silverscale Banking House|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/Silverscale Banking House conspiracy.

What makes Aurelius particularly dangerous is not just his financial acumen, but his growing connection to entities beyond the normal world—specifically, his pact with something that whispers from the depths of [02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Abyss Beneath Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Abyss Beneath Aquabyssos]]. This otherworldly patron has granted him abilities that blur the line between financial manipulation and mind control, making him both incredibly wealthy and increasingly inhuman.

## Physical Description and Presence

### Distinctive Appearance

Aurelius Goldwave is immediately recognizable throughout [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos's elite circles. His merfolk tail bears scales of a distinctive golden hue that seems to shift and flow like liquid metal, catching light in ways that mesmerize observers and make accurate counting of his scale patterns nearly impossible. This golden coloration extends up his torso in subtle patterns that suggest wealth and success to those who view him.

His facial features are sharp and aristocratic, with piercing amber eyes that seem to evaluate everything in terms of monetary value. When he smiles—which is often during business negotiations—his teeth appear to have been replaced with actual gold, though closer examination reveals them to be natural teeth that have somehow taken on metallic properties. His hair flows in controlled waves, each strand appearing to contain flecks of actual gold dust.

### Supernatural Modifications

Years of exposure to otherworldly influence have left subtle but disturbing changes in Aurelius's appearance:

**The Golden Glow**: In certain lighting conditions, his scales emit a faint luminescence that makes numbers and financial calculations visible in the water around him
**Memory Tendrils**: Almost invisible filaments extend from his fingertips during physical contact, allowing him to access and manipulate memories
**The Third Eye**: A barely perceptible golden mark on his forehead that occasionally opens to reveal an alien eye that can see through deceptions and illusions
**Currency Sense**: His touch can instantly determine the exact value of any object or substance, causing his fingertips to glow when contact is made

### Professional Demeanor

Aurelius maintains an impeccably professional appearance at all times. His clothing is always the finest available, crafted from rare deep-sea materials and adorned with authentic treasures recovered from the [02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Leviathan Graveyard]]. He moves with the confident grace of someone accustomed to being the wealthiest person in any room, yet maintains an approachable demeanor that puts potential clients at ease.

## Background and History

### Early Life and Legitimate Success

Aurelius Goldwave began his career as a genuinely talented financial advisor in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/New Tethys, where his analytical mind and intuitive understanding of market patterns quickly earned him a reputation among the emerging merchant class. Born to a middle-class family of pearl cultivators, he demonstrated an almost supernatural ability to predict economic trends and identify profitable investments.

His early success was built on legitimate skill—Aurelius possessed an uncanny ability to read the currents of [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]'s developing economy and guide his clients toward profitable ventures. Within five years of establishing his practice, he had accumulated enough wealth to open offices in three major cities and attract clients from the highest levels of underwater society.

### The Silverscale Recruitment

Aurelius's transformation from legitimate businessman to corrupt manipulator began when he was approached by representatives of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Silverscale Banking House|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/Silverscale Banking House during his eighth year of practice. The banking house recognized his talents and offered him opportunities that seemed too good to refuse—access to exclusive investment information, connections with the most powerful figures in [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], and most tempting of all, magical enhancements to his already considerable abilities.

The seduction was gradual. At first, Aurelius believed he was simply joining an exclusive financial network that provided advantages to its members. He was encouraged to use minor memory magic to help clients overcome emotional barriers to sound financial decisions—a practice that seemed beneficial to all involved. Over time, these "therapeutic" memory alterations became more extensive and self-serving.

### The Otherworldly Pact

The turning point in Aurelius's corruption came during a deep-sea expedition to investigate investment opportunities in the [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Abyss Beneath Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Abyss Beneath Aquabyssos. While exploring ancient ruins for potential salvage operations, he encountered something that should not exist in the natural world—an entity of pure avarice and manipulation that offered him power beyond imagining in exchange for service.

The pact was sealed not with blood, but with gold—specifically, with a single golden scale from Aurelius's tail that the entity consumed. In return, he gained abilities that transformed him from a skilled financier into something approaching a financial deity. The cost was his gradual loss of humanity and his binding to serve the entity's inscrutable goals.

### Rise to Power

Armed with otherworldly power and backed by the [02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Silverscale Banking House|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/Silverscale Banking House]]'s resources, Aurelius expanded his operations throughout [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos and into surface markets. He established the Goldwave Financial Consortium as a front for increasingly complex financial manipulation schemes, using his enhanced abilities to:

- Extract and sell memories containing valuable business information
- Manipulate clients into making decisions that benefited his hidden masters
- Create artificial market conditions that generated massive profits for his conspiracy
- Identify and recruit other individuals susceptible to otherworldly influence

## Current Operations and Schemes

### The Memory Investment Program

Aurelius's most insidious current operation involves what he calls "Memory Investment"—a service offered to wealthy clients who wish to "optimize their decision-making capacity." Clients are told that traumatic or emotionally charged memories can be temporarily stored in magical containers, allowing for clearer thinking during important financial decisions.

In reality, these extracted memories are sold in the [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Memory Meadows Black Market]], providing valuable intelligence to various criminal organizations while leaving clients with gaps in their knowledge that Aurelius can exploit. The memories are categorized and priced based on their content:

**Corporate Secrets**: High-value memories containing trade information, business strategies, or competitive intelligence
**Personal Vulnerabilities**: Embarrassing or compromising memories useful for blackmail
**Technical Knowledge**: Memories containing specialized skills or magical techniques
**Historical Information**: Memories of past events that could be politically or economically significant

### The Golden Current Network

Aurelius has established a network of financially dependent individuals throughout [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos's power structure. These people, known internally as the "Golden Current," are clients who have become so reliant on Aurelius's advice and financial support that they essentially serve as his agents within their respective organizations.

Members of the Golden Current include:
- Mid-level bureaucrats in the [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Parliament of Echoes]]
- Military officers responsible for equipment procurement
- Merchant guild leaders who control trade routes
- Academic researchers whose work has commercial applications
- Religious leaders who influence public opinion

### The Surface Expansion Project

One of Aurelius's most ambitious current schemes involves expanding his influence into [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor's crystal-based economy. Working through intermediaries and using magically disguised communication methods, he has begun offering financial services to surface merchants and nobles, gradually building a client base that could eventually be exploited in the same manner as his underwater operations.

This expansion serves multiple purposes:
- Gathering intelligence about [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s magical and economic capabilities
- Creating financial dependencies that could be leveraged during times of conflict
- Testing whether his otherworldly patron's influence extends to surface-dwelling populations
- Establishing escape routes and alternative power bases should his [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos operations be discovered

### The Shard Hunt Initiative

Recent intelligence suggests that Aurelius has become aware of [02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]] and their potential value. He has begun funding archaeological expeditions and hiring adventuring parties to locate and recover these artifacts, using his financial network to track down leads and purchase information about their whereabouts.

His interest in the Shards appears to be twofold:
- Their immense magical power could enhance his own otherworldly abilities
- Controlling them would provide leverage over both [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos and [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]'s governments

## Abilities and Powers

### Financial Supernatural Abilities

**Value Sight**: Aurelius can instantly determine the exact monetary worth of any object, person, or situation through magical perception
**Market Prediction**: Limited precognitive abilities allow him to predict short-term economic trends with uncanny accuracy
**Wealth Attraction**: Passive ability that causes profitable opportunities to present themselves to him regularly
**Golden Touch**: Can temporarily transform small objects into gold, useful for demonstrations of power and bribing officials
**Economic Empathy**: Can sense the financial fears, desires, and vulnerabilities of those around him

### Memory Manipulation Powers

**Memory Extraction**: Can remove specific memories from willing or subdued subjects, storing them in physical containers
**Memory Implantation**: Can insert false or modified memories into targets, though this requires extended contact and concentration
**Memory Trading**: Can transfer memories between individuals, allowing for the sale of experiences and knowledge
**Selective Amnesia**: Can cause targets to forget specific financial transactions, debts, or agreements
**Memory Encryption**: Can hide memories so thoroughly that even magical detection fails to find them

### Otherworldly Patron Abilities

**Eldritch Insight**: Receives visions and knowledge from his otherworldly patron, providing information that should be impossible to obtain
**Reality Distortion**: Can create minor alterations in local reality, typically used to ensure favorable outcomes in business dealings
**Corruption Aura**: Extended contact with Aurelius gradually corrupts others, making them more susceptible to greed and manipulation
**Dimensional Communication**: Can communicate with entities from other planes, trading information and favors across reality barriers
**Shadow Finance**: Can manipulate economic forces through supernatural means, creating artificial market conditions

### Conventional Skills

Despite his supernatural enhancements, Aurelius retains considerable mundane abilities:
- Expert knowledge of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos and surface world economics
- Master-level skills in negotiation, persuasion, and deception
- Extensive network of contacts throughout multiple social strata
- Advanced understanding of magical theory and artifact identification
- Fluency in multiple languages and cultural traditions

## Connection to Campaign Themes

### Shadow Corruption Spread

Aurelius represents a unique vector for shadow corruption—rather than being directly infected, his pact with an otherworldly entity makes him a willing agent of forces that operate outside normal reality. His financial network provides an ideal method for spreading corruption throughout [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]'s power structure, using economic dependency to create vulnerability to otherworldly influence.

The corruption he spreads is subtle but pervasive:
- Clients gradually become more greedy, callous, and manipulative
- Economic systems become increasingly unstable and exploitative
- Traditional values of community and cooperation erode in favor of pure self-interest
- The boundary between legitimate business and supernatural manipulation dissolves

### The Seven Shards Quest

Aurelius's interest in [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards makes him a major antagonist in campaigns focused on these artifacts. His financial resources, information networks, and supernatural abilities make him a formidable competitor for any group seeking to locate and control the Shards.

His approach to the Shard quest differs from other antagonists:
- Rather than using force, he attempts to purchase or manipulate his way to the artifacts
- He creates economic incentives for others to do his dangerous work
- He uses his memory manipulation abilities to steal knowledge about Shard locations
- He builds long-term financial dependencies that can be leveraged when Shards are discovered

### Marina's Identity Crisis

Aurelius's memory manipulation abilities make him a significant threat in storylines involving [02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Marina's Identity Crisis|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/Marina's Identity Crisis]]. He could:

- Extract memories that help determine Marina's true identity
- Implant false memories that further confuse her identity crisis
- Trade memories related to Marina's condition to the highest bidder
- Use Marina's fractured memories as leverage over those trying to help her

His involvement could either help resolve the crisis or make it significantly worse, depending on his motivations and the player characters' actions.

### Convergence Crisis Implications

During [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Convergence Crisis, Aurelius's otherworldly connections could make him either a valuable ally or a catastrophic threat. His patron entity might provide crucial information about dimensional stability, or it might seek to exploit the crisis to expand its influence into multiple reality layers.

Potential roles during the crisis:
- Information broker selling intelligence about dimensional threats
- Saboteur working to destabilize reality for his patron's benefit
- Refugee seeking protection from entities pursuing him across dimensions
- Key figure whose corruption must be cleansed to stabilize reality

## Adventure Hooks and Plot Seeds

### The Golden Investment Scam
**Level**: 6-10
Characters discover that several prominent citizens have had their memories stolen and sold, leaving them with gaps in their knowledge that are being exploited by mysterious financial advisors. Investigation leads to Aurelius's operation and a race to recover the stolen memories before they're permanently lost.

### The Surface Market Manipulation
**Level**: 8-12
[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] merchants report impossible economic conditions that seem designed to benefit unknown [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos interests.

### The Memory Auction
**Level**: 10-14
The [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Memory Meadows Black Market]] announces a special auction featuring memories stolen from high-ranking government officials. Characters must infiltrate the auction to prevent state secrets from being sold while confronting Aurelius as the primary seller.

### The Patron's Demand
**Level**: 12-16
Aurelius's otherworldly patron demands a specific service that would destabilize [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos's economy and government. He approaches the characters as potential agents, offering incredible wealth in exchange for completing tasks that seem legitimate but serve sinister purposes.

### The Shard Bidding War
**Level**: 14-18
One of [02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]] has been located, and Aurelius enters a complex bidding war involving multiple factions. Characters must prevent him from acquiring the artifact while navigating economic warfare, memory manipulation, and otherworldly interference.

## Secrets for the DM

> [!secret] DM Secret - The True Patron
> Aurelius's otherworldly patron is actually a fragment of the entity that created [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards, trapped in the deep places of [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] since the ancient cataclysm. Acquiring the Shards would not only grant Aurelius incredible power but could potentially free his patron to reshape reality according to its alien desires.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Memory Vault
> Aurelius has been secretly collecting and storing the memories of everyone he's ever encountered, building a vast archive of intelligence that could destabilize every major faction in both [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos and [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]. This memory vault is hidden in a pocket dimension accessible only through his offices.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Succession Plan
> Aurelius has been grooming several potential successors, gradually corrupting them with otherworldly influence. If he is killed or permanently incapacitated, these agents will activate and continue his work, making his defeat potentially just the beginning of the threat rather than its end.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Golden Scale Curse
> The golden scale Aurelius sacrificed to his patron contained a fragment of one of [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]]' power, inherited through his bloodline from ancient times. This connection explains both his financial abilities and his patron's interest in him. Recovering this scale fragment could be crucial to resolving multiple campaign crises.
