--- # Tinderstrike

*Weapon ([[Dagger Xphb]]), legendary (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/tinderstrike.webp#right) - **Damage**: `dice: 1d4` piercing
- **Range**: 20/60
- **Properties**: [[item properties#Finesse|Finesse, [item properties#Light|Light]], [[item properties#Thrown|Thrown
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs. A flint dagger, Tinderstrike is uncommonly sharp, and sparks cascade off its edge whenever it strikes something solid. Its handle is always warm to the touch, and the blade smolders for`d4`minutes after it is used to deal damage. It contains a spark of [Imix Pota]], Prince of Evil Fire. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra``dice: 2d6``fire damage. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Fire Mastery You gain the following benefits while you hold Tinderstrike: - You can speak Ig fluently. - You have resistance to fire damage. - You can cast [[Dominate Monster Xphb (save **DC 17**) on a [elemental]]. Once you have done so, Tinderstrike can't be used this way again until the next dawn. ## Dance of the All-Consuming Fire While inside a fire node, you can perform a ritual called the Dance of the All-Consuming Fire, using Tinderstrike to create a [[devastation-orb-of-fire-pota (items). Once you perform the ritual, Tinderstrike can't be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn. ## Flaw Tinderstrike makes its wielder impatient and rash. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I act without thinking and take risks without weighing the consequences." *Source: Princes of the Apocalypse p. 224* ## Player-Facing Summary Tinderstrike pota is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of tinderstrike pota as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around tinderstrike pota. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Strange accidents suggest a portal
