## Description
A critical tool for drawing out precipitants, this modern contraption works on the same principle as the mill wheel. By applying pressure to foot-pedals near the floor, the weighted horizontal wheel is set in motion. When stoppered [[Beakers|vials]] are set in the wheel and spun, heavy solids fall from the liquid to the base of the vial. (25 gp)
