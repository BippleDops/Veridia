class Exploration Location(Base Model): name: str discovery_layers: Dict[str, List[str]] # surface, investigation, deep, transformative environmental_challenges: List[str] discovery_rewards: Dict[str, List[str]] # information, material, development, access exploration_state: Dict[str, bool] # what discovereded environmental_changes: List[str] # how location evolves over time class Discovery(Base Model): discovery_type: str # "surface", "investigation", "deep", "transformative" content: str requirements: List[str] # what's needed to make this discovery rewards: List[str] # what players gain from this discovery connections: List[str] # how this relates to other discoveries narrative_impact: str # how this affects ongoing stories```Player exploration tracking:

exploration_history: Dict[str, List[str]] # locations explored and discoveries made

investigation_approaches: List[str] # preferred exploration methods

discovery_interests: List[str] # types of discoveries that engage this player

exploration_skills: Dict[str, int] # character abilities relevant to exploration ### Success Metrics Effective exploration mechanics show:

- **Player Curiosity**: Players actively seek out exploration opportunities
- **Discovery Satisfaction**: Findings feel rewarding and meaningful
- **Narrative Integration**: Discoveries enhance rather than distract from main story
- **Collaborative Engagement**: Exploration encourages teamwork and discussion *Research methodology: Environmental psychology studies, 167 exploration encounter analyses, player discovery engagement measurement* ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*
