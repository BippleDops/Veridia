# Trap #17 - "The "What's Up?" Dock."
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> This room exhibits an immediate difference from others so far seen. It is 80 feet long and 30 feet wide, with a 15 foot tall ceiling. The most obvious difference is the fact that at the far end of the room there is a 30 foot by 30 foot wooden pier, opening into a cavern, the inky depths of which are impenetrable by feeble torch light. The pier itself is just out of clear view in the flickering light. The sounds of running [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|water]] are very clearly audible; in fact the roar of moving [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|water]] can be heard echoing from inside the room.
> 
> The party of delvers will sense no magic in this room. The floor is tiled with large green and blue 10 foot by 10 foot tiles, looking very much like a giant checker board.
> 
> Any mean spirited attempt to use magic to see if there are trapdoors in the floor will result in the entire floor glowing dully for a few moments, then fading. That should really stir the delvers up.
> 
> Any attempt to walk on the tiled floor will show it to be quite substantial, and yielding no "nasty" surprises. The party can [[8 - Movement (D&D 5e SRD)|jump]] up and down on the tiles if they like and nothing will result. As the party gets nearer to the pier they will be able to see that it is made of large wooden beams, old and rotten with the passage of time. At points they will be able to see dark [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|water]] 15 feet below the pier through sections that seem to have just given way to decay.
> 
> In the center of the leading edge of the pier, touching the tiles, in an old trap door 10 feet by 10 feet square. Set in the center of this wooden panel is a ring bolt over 1 foot round, and covered with corrosion. The party can, if it chooses, open this door from the tile side without risking the rotten old pier. If any member of the party steps onto the pier, on either side of the trap door, or tries to open the trap door, all the tiles in the other part of the room flip over. The tiles are giant panels locked in place until the trap is tripped. Once released they are free to pivot on iron shafts that penetrate them through the center. This whole trap operates like one of the child's bean bag tossing games. (See Diagram)
> 
> The net result will dump any member of the party without the ability to [[14 - Monsters (D&D 5e SRD)|fly]] into an arm of the grotto at the far end of the room. There is almost no other way, except flight, to escape this trap. A lucky [[8 - Movement (D&D 5e SRD)|jump]] in all but one direction will either place the delver on another tile ... flip-flopsplash! or back out the entrance and ... zip-splat! an 110 foot drop. A victim may try to [[3 - Weapons (D&D 5e SRD)|reach]] the "safety" of the pier, but there is only a 40% chance (L4) of success. At any rate most of the party should end up in the drink.
> 
> At this point I should describe the reasons why delvers won't enjoy their refreshing dip. This underground river system is part of the vast network of unchaned rivers that run under the plains of Khosht. The reasons for it's remaining uncharted are twofold. The first reason is the concentrations of gold, and loot-like substances are too widely scattered to make it attractive to large scale delving operations. The second reason is the existence of hideous denizens that have bred herein thriving on the residual magic and corruption leaking down into the [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|water]] table from the innumerable dungeons located above the river system.
> 
> In this pleasant little tributary can be found:
> 
> **Pack Piranha**, hordes of ravenous little beasties that can strip an [[Elf (D&D 5e SRD)|elf]] to his ear rings in seconds. (These creatures travel in large groups and should be considered VERY tough.) [[Swarm of Quippers (D&D 5e SRD)|Swarm of Quippers]]
> 
> **Albino Cave Sharks**, often over 8 feet long, a ghastly white in color, hunt by motion sensing, so if you [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|fall]] into the [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|water]] remain absolutely still and you will be just [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|food]] ... er ... fine. (These creatures can be found in groups of 3 to 8 (`dice: 1D6+2`) and are individually Tough. If the odds are 3 or 4 to one even superhuman delvers will find themselves in dire straights.) Giant Electric Catfish
> 
> **Electro-Squids**, these cute little fellows pack a wollop that would do justice to a [[Lightning Bolt (D&D 5e SRD)|lightning bolt]]. Being small and relatively feeble they either grab hold of prey and zap it for [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|food]], or in the case of larger monsters which gulp them down whole, they zap them into unconsciousness, then nibble their way out! (These guys are not so Lough bul the "electro" can finish off the uninitiated by stunning them. If help is not forthcoming, drowning and lunch soon follow.) [[Gloom Crawler]]
> 
> **Blind Barricudas**, these creatures travel in schools and are famed for the length of their teeth and their healthy appetites. (Again a style of monster that travels in groups. Not as small or as hard to hit as Piranha or as big, mean and strong as the Sharks these critters can be beaten in combat.) [[Eel Hound (ToB)|Eel Hound]]
> 
> **Lastly there can be found the fiendish Crystal Sea Snakes**: they do not travel in large groups, and they are physically fragile. An average warrior can easily kill one in hand to hand combat. However during contact with one of these creatures there is a 40% chance (L4) of being bitten. They are [[17 - Damage and Healing (D&D 5e SRD)|lightning]] fast and their venom is deadly, and works almost instantaneously. (There is a substantial volume of thought that this is one of the few forms of poison more virulent than Dragon Venom! Capturing one of these creatures and milking it for venom would be an interesting commercial enterprise, if one were to survive the quick strike capabilities.) [[Isonade (ToB)|Isonade]]
> 
> Keep in mind most of the above creatures travel in groups. Add them liberally to spice up any member of the tomb robbing party's bracing dip in the underground river. 
> 
> The trap itself is worth two skulls, the denizens of the river can collect their own skulls. (As a matter of fact, it wilJ be your skulls they will be collecting!)
