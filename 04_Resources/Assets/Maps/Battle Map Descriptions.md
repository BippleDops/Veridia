## Consequence Chains

The actions and decisions involving Battle Map Descriptions (VTT-Ready) create cascading effects across multiple levels of society and time.

### Immediate Consequences
*minutes to hours - direct participants and witnesses*

- **Direct Impact**: Regional political alliances shift or form
- **Direct Impact**: Trade networks experience disruption or expansion

*often reversible with quick action*

### Short-term Consequences
*days to months - extended networks and communities*

- **Extended Impact**: Economic specialization patterns shift geographically
- **Extended Impact**: Cultural exchange accelerates or contracts

*difficult but possible to reverse*

### Long-term Consequences
*years to decades - entire societies and future generations*

- **Lasting Impact**: Regional identity and character permanently shaped
- **Lasting Impact**: Economic role in inter-regional trade evolves

*permanent or requiring massive effort to change*

### Butterfly Effect Potential

**Interpersonal moment that cascades through networks**

*Example Multiplier*: Betrayal that triggers wider distrust

### Consequence Tracking

**Status Monitoring**: Track immediate visible effects and stakeholder reactions
**Network Analysis**: Monitor how effects spread through relationship networks
**Timeline Tracking**: Record when different consequence levels manifest
**Mitigation Options**: Identify intervention points where consequences can be modified
**Amplification Factors**: Recognize conditions that might intensify effects

    "prompt": "# TTRPG Asset Generation Prompt\n\n## Core Structure\n[Asset Type: map]\n[Game System: D&D 5e]\n[Intended Use: VTT and Print reference]\n\n## Detailed Description\nSubject: Golden Trade Route Toll\nEnvironment: encounter space with clear tactical layout\nStyle: heroic tabletop fantasy (D&D 5e adjacent), unified painterly collection style, grounded medieval-fantasy materials, culturally coherent gear, no modern tech or signage, hand-painted top-down with clear grid, aquatic fantasy realism, subsurface caustics, bioluminescent accents, pressure-dome materials\nTechnical Requirements: grid 30x30 squares at 140 DPI (70 px per 5 ft minimum, 140 px preferred), aspect 1:1, resolution 1024x1024\nPalette: teals, deep blues, sea-greens, pearl highlights\n\n## Functional Elements (for maps)\n- Tactical Features: multiple routes and flanking options, ramps, stairs, ledges, or contour lines, collapses, rips, currents; marked clearly, cover options\n- Scale: 30x30 squares, each square = 5 feet\n- Clarity: bold lines for walls/obstacles; fine lines for textures; consistent terrain patterns\n\n## Visual Specifications\n- Lighting: studio\n- Detail Level: high detail for zoom, simplified for overview\n- Composition: rule of thirds with clear focal points and visual flow\n\n## Practical Considerations\n- Must be readable at intended viewing size\n- No embedded text labels; use icons and clear linework only. Reserve clean margins and text-safe areas for VTT overlays. Render grid and numeric ticks crisply; avoid stylized fonts entirely. Zero rasterized words.\n- Avoid embedded text unless specified; prefer iconography and numbered pins\n\n## Negatives\n- nonsense text, watermarks, captions, signatures, artist names; modern signage, photoreal CGI, anime style, bloom glare; overly sexualized or glamorized portrayal\n\nThink deeply about creating an asset that enhances gameplay immersion while maintaining practical usability for TTRPG sessions.",
