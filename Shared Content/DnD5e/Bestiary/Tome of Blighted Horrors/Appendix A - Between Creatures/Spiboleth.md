**Senses**: Tremorsense 60 ft.

**Languages**: Common, Deep Speech

**Size**: Large

**Type**: Aberration

## Special Traits
**All-Around Vision:** A spiboleth’s multiple eyes allow it to scan quickly in all directions. Attackers never gain tactical advantage or bonus damage against it from the presence of nearby allies.

**Paralytic Poison:** The spiboleth’s mucus contains a paralytic poison. A creature that comes into contact with the mucus must make a DC 14 Con saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature is poisoned until the end of its next turn; if it fails, the creature is paralyzed for as long as it remains in contact with spiboleth webbing, or for 1 minute. A paralyzed creature that’s not in contact with webbing repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on a success.

**Spell-like Abilities:** The spiboleth can use the following spell-like abilities, using Intelligence as its casting ability (DC 14, attack +6). The spiboleth doesn’t need material components to use these abilities. At will: color spray, dancing lights, minor illusion, silent image 3/day: charm person, hypnotic pattern, phantasmal force 1/day: dominate monster

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The spiboleth attacks twice with its claws and once with its tail.

**Melee Attack—Claw:** +7 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d10 + 4` piercing damage, and the creature is exposed to the spiboleth’s paralytic poison (see below).

**Melee Attack—Tail Slap:** +7 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 4d8 + 4` bludgeoning damage, and the target is knocked prone.

**Ranged Attack—Mucus Web (recharge 4-6):** The spiboleth launches globs of mucus at a target within 50 feet. The target must make a successful DC 14 Dex saving throw or be restrained and be exposed to the spiboleth’s paralytic poison (see below). A restrained creature can break free by using an action to make a successful DC 13 Str or Dex check. This attack is equally effective above or under water.

## Description
**Environment**: Coast, sea (Between)

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, or colony (3–8)

It’s unknown whether the physicians stole their ideas from the aboleths of the Unsea or the aboleths of the Unsea stole their concept from the physicians of Castorhage. What is known is that the spiboleths are essentially a golem-stitched mixture of aboleth and giant spider and that the physicians didn’t create them. The spiboleths dwell primarily in the shallows of the Unsea where they work with the vile aboleths of that realm as almost-equal partners. They possess the same intellect and massive egos as the aboleths, but are slightly inferior in magical aptitude and physical prowess, a fact not lost on the aboleths who claim to be their original creators. The aboleths do not outright enslave the spiboleths, however, because the spiboleths are still relatively powerful and far too egotistical to accept such an arrangement without an outright rebellion. The spiboleths are much too useful to the aboleths as spies and agents to be sent to the mundane world. In the eyes of the aboleths, the spiboleths have value and they, therefore, bite back their prejudice and paternalism toward them, limiting it to occasional small hints of superiority and a secret knowledge among their own as to the truth of the matter. The spiboleths are well aware of the aboleths’ thoughts on the matter, but they have not yet bred in numbers sufficient to overthrow the more-powerful aboleths. For now, it behooves both sides to cooperate and at least appear gracious toward one another even if always looking for some sign of weakness to exploit. This constant tension between aboleth and spiboleth is perhaps the greatest asset that the peoples of the mundane world have against their machinations.

Spiboleths superficially resemble a smaller version of the aboleths, but with chitin-covered, spiderlike legs instead of tentacles. In addition, though they have the same vertical arrangement of eyes, those of the spiboleth are actually multifaceted and provide the spiboleth with a greater field of vision. Though powerful in their own right, the spiboleths are still less powerful than their aboleth cousins, and they do not possess the same form-altering slime and mucus cloud as the aboleths. Instead, the spiboleths have the ability to live indefinitely out of the water, though they are more comfortable in damp places where they can keep their bodies moist, and they possess the ability to secrete a thick mucus from which they can construct great webs made from thick strands of the nearly translucent substance. The webs are somewhat sticky, but the mucus also has a paralytic poison that makes them much more dangerous. Though spiboleths hail from Between, many of them find their way into the mundane world and set up hidden lairs in the waters and along the coasts. There is no telling how many of the great docks or blind riverside alleys that seem empty at a glance actually hold the web-strung lairs of these spiderlike aberrations hidden behind the camouflage of mirage arcana or illusory walls as they watch their oblivious prey wandering by mere yards away and contemplate their murky thoughts of conquest.

As befits their arachnid heredity, spiboleths have glands beneath their heads that secrete a thick mucus. The spiboleth forms this mucus into tough but flexible strands that it weaves into a web. This web can extend both above and below water, and with multiple spiboleths contributing to the construction, these webs can be made immense. Large air bubbles can be attached to the web below water, allowing air-breathing creatures to survive for up to 2 hours while caught in the web. Spiboleths can also create sheets of mucus webbing up to three times their own size. They usually position these to snare unwary creatures. Normally, approaching creatures could see one of these webs easily, but spiboleths usually camouflage them with illusions, hoping victims stumble into them and are quickly paralyzed. Each 5-foot section of mucus web has AC 8, 15 hit points, immunity to necrotic, poison, psychic, and radiant damage, and resistance to all other damage types except slashing.

A spiboleth moves across mucus webbing without hindrance, and its tremorsense allows it to pinpoint the location of any creature touching the web.
