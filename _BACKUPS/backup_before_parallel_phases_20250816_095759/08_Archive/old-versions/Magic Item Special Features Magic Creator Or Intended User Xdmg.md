| 9 | Elemental Fire. This item is warm to the touch, and any metal parts are crafted from black iron. Flame imagery covers its surface. |

| 16 | Gnome. The item is crafted to appear ordinary and well used. It could also incorporate gears and mechanical components, even if these aren't essential to its function. |
| 17â€“19 | Human. The item was created during the heyday of a fallen human kingdom, or it is tied to a human of legend. It might hold writing in a forgotten language or symbols whose significance is lost to the ages. |
| 20 | Undead. The item incorporates symbols of death, such as bones and skulls, and it might be crafted from parts of corpses. It feels cold to the touch. |
