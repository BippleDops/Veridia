    "description": "Umbra Mirrorbane exists as living proof that identity itself can be stolen, copied, and perverted. He is not born but rather manifested from the collective fears of those who doubt themselves, created when shadows gain enough sentience to resent their original casters.\n\nIn his natural form, Umbra appears as a constantly shifting humanoid silhouette, darker than the deepest ocean trench. His \"face\" is a void that seems to absorb light, with only two points of silver light marking where eyes might be. When impersonating others, he achieves perfect physical mimicry, but observant individuals might notice that his shadow moves independently or that mirrors reflect something subtly wrong.\n\nUmbra feeds on identity and self-doubt, growing stronger each time he successfully impersonates someone and causes them to question their own sense of self. His ultimate goal is not merely survival, but the complete erasure of individual identity in favor of a world where everyone is interchangeable.\n\nHe operates from the Reflection District, a maze-like area where mirrors line every surface and reality becomes questionable. Here, visitors often lose track of which reflection is real and which belongs to Umbra's machinations.",
