## Description
This [[Staff|staff]] can be wielded as a magic [[Quarterstaff|quarterstaff]] that grants a +3 bonus to [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] and damage rolls made with it.

The [[Staff|staff]] has 10 charges. When you hit with a melee [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] using it, you can expend up to 3 of its charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra `dice: 1d6` (1d6) [[17 - Damage and Healing|force]] damage. The staff regains `dice: 1d6+4` (1d6+4) expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical [[Quarterstaff|quarterstaff]].
