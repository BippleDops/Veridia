# Inn and Tavern
## Overview
I am convinced that far more important business takes place every day in the inns and taverns of Faerun than in the castles and keeps. Here is where desperate folk on desperate quests cross paths and exchange at least glances, and more often gold and stories. Perhaps even more than (and my ecclesiastical friends must forgive me) temples, taverns and inns provide the gathering point for the folk of Toril, for to temples we come in unusual adoration or penitence, but in the tavern we come as ourselves. How many deals struck over a frothy tankard have spelled salvation (or doom) for our troubled land? How many great warriors (or warlords) learned their trade in barroom brawls? With roof and fire to turn the wintry blasts and ale and tales to warm the wintry heart, taverns and inns draw us all. So saying, I salute the proprietors of these salvific institutions, and offer them Faerunâ€™s finest assortment of wares for their business. All are made of the finest materials by the best artisans that Toril has to offer.
