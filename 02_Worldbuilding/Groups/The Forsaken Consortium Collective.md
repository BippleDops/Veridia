## Overview

The Forsaken Consortium Collective has transformed the abandoned industrial zones of [[Aethermoor]] into a thriving alternative economy based on salvage, reclamation, and adaptive reuse. What began as desperate scavenging in the ruins of failed commercial enterprises has evolved into a sophisticated organization that controls the kingdom's abandoned infrastructure and forgotten industrial sites.

Born from the economic collapse that followed [[The Shattering]], the Collective emerged when thousands of workers were left unemployed as major trading companies and manufacturing guilds fled or failed. Rather than seek new employment elsewhere, these displaced workers banded together to claim, repair, and repurpose the facilities their former employers abandoned.

The Collective operates under the principle of "Abandoned Rights"â€”that any facility or resource left unused for more than one year becomes available for community reclamation. They've created a parallel economy that thrives in the spaces between official commerce, turning industrial graveyards into productive communities.

### The Great Abandonment (Post-Shattering Era)
Following [[The Shattering]], major commercial entities fled [[Aethermoor]], leaving behind:
- 47 major manufacturing facilities
- 23 warehouse and distribution complexes  
- 15 mining operations and processing plants
- 8 major port and shipping facilities
- Thousands of smaller workshops and commercial buildings

### The Worker's Uprising
Displaced employees, led by former industrial foremen, organized to:
- Prevent total economic collapse in affected areas
- Maintain their communities and families
- Preserve industrial knowledge and skills
- Create alternative economic opportunities

### The Collective Charter

- Democratic goverce structure

- Defense against external exploitation
- Integration with legitimate businesses willing to work cooperatively
