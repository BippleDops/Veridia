# Ring of Spell Turning
*Ring, legendary (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/ring-of-spell-turning.webp#right)


While wearing this ring, you have [[advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on saving throws against spells. If you succeed on the save for a spell of level 7 or lower, the spell has no effect on you. If that spell targeted only you and didn't create an area of effect, you can take a [[reaction-xphb|Reaction]] to deflect the spell back at the spell's caster; the caster must make a saving throw against the spell using their own spell save DC.
