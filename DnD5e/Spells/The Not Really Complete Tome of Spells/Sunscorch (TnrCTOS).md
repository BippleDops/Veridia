# Sunscorch (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
An intense blast of heat and light emanates from your hand, forming a narrow beam that curves around obstacles and moves to follow its target, which it strikes unerringly.

The blast deals 2d10 fire damage and 2d10 radiant damage. If the creature is wearing metal armor or a shield, or holding any metal item that is larger than Small, then it takes an additional 1d10 fire damage as the sun heats the metal up to unbearable tem-peratures.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a 4th-level or higher spell slot, it does an additional 1d10 fire *or* radiant dam-age per slot level above 3rd.
