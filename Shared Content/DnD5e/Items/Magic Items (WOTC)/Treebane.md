# Treebane

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Battleaxe, Melee Weapon, Martial Weapon

**Rarity:** unknown (magic)

**Weight**: 2 lbs.

**Damage:** 1d8 slashing versatile (1d10)

## Description

The axe's handle is carved with leaves and vines, and it weighs half as much as a normal battleaxe. When the axe hits a plant, whether an ordinary plant or a plant creature, the target takes an extra `dice: 1d8` slashing damage. When a creature of non-good alignment wields the axe, it sprouts thorns whenever its wielder makes an attack with it. These thorns prick the wielder for 1 piercing damage after the attack is made, and this damage is considered magical.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
