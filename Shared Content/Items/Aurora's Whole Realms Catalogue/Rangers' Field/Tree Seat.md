## Description
Those unfamiliar with the ways of the wilderness commonly do not realize that a fortress lies in every tree. Our tree seat provides rangers a high and inconspicuous vantage for guarding in forested areas. Modeled after the crowâ€™s nests aboard ships, the tree seat is the watchtower of the wood. A ranger in a tree seat almost invariably gets off the first shot or sends out the first warning call, and such folk are never garrotted. Assembled and mounted in minutes, the tree seat is constructed of sturdy duskwood and its steel claws will not slip. Not to be used on treants. (15 gp)

## Additional Details
requires Dex check to assemble correctly; provides watcher +3 to surprise roll and ground creatures a -3 to surprise roll; doubles range of vision
