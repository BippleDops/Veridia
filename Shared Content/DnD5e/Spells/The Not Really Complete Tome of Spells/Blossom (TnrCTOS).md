# Blossom (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 3 hours

**Range**: self (300-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (an ear of grain and a gallon of water)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You spend three hours meditating and the area around you becomes much more verdant and fertile than it was before. If the land was dry, it becomes moist. If the land was waterlogged and swampy, the water drains away to reveal fresh loam.

This spell cannot, in and of itself, over-come truly bad conditions such as that caused by a long and terrible drought, but it can help to improve conditions somewhat.

A particular plot of land can only be affected by this spell once per season, and the effects last until the end of the current growing season.
