## Description
In my many travels, I met more than a few wizards who had lost a finger to acids or knives in their labs. Contact poisons provide another reason to wear good gloves. Our [[Clay|clay]]-steeped canvas gloves (2 gp) guard against most substances. Our steel-reinforced leather gloves (5 gp) provide as much protection as a gauntlet, without the accompanying weight.

## Additional Details
2 pairs of each type are needed for a complete laboratory
