  "revised_prompt": "Paint an image that calls to mind a heroic tabletop fantasy, taking inspiration from 5e tabletop games, but in a painterly collection style. The main artifact is the Devastation Orb of Water - a complex object made from materials such as pearl, coral, cloud-crystal, and pressure-forged metals adorned with abstract, non-alphabetical sigils that emit a gentle glow. Showcase it in a rendered scene that suggests aquatic fantasy realism, complete with subsurface caustics and bioluminescent accents, reflecting the aesthetics of a submerged realm. The size scale is indicated by either an anonymous hand or a ruler. As for the color palette, lean into teals, deep blues, sea-greens with pearl highlights. Steer clear of modern tech, firearms, readable words on items, anime style, sci-fi UIs, modern signage, photoreal CGI, and bloom glare. Material visually should appear to sustain high pressure, like materials used to build underwater domes.",
