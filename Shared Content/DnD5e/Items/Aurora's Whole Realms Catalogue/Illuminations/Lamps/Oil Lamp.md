### Oil Lamp (Pic)

## Description
Oil [[Lamps|lamps]] are a staple form of illumination, but are more suited to indoor use as they are difficult to carry and prone to go out in breezes. Oil [[Lamps|lamps]] can be formed of many materials, and I offer exquisite versions in several mediums (all hold one pint of oil and a wick in their bowls): Carved onyx (other semiprecious stones available by special order), 9 sp; worked brass, 5 sp; and [[Oven|kiln]]-glazed pottery, 1 sp.

## Additional Details
Lights a 360-degree area out to 15 feet. Burns 12 hours per pint of oil. Holds a pint.
