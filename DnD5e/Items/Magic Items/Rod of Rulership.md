## Description
You can use an action to present the [[Rod|rod]] and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15 [[Wisdom|Wisdom]] saving throw or be [[Charmed|charmed]] by you for 8 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do something contrary to its [[Intelligence|nature]], a target ceases to be charmed in this way. The rod canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.
