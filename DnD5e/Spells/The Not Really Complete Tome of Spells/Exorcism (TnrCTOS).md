# Exorcism (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 hour

**Range**: 10 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a silver bell, a book of prayers, and a blessed candle that must re-main lit throughout the ritual)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You attempt to get rid of an evil spirit, fiend, ghost, or other such creature that is possessing a living creature.

At the spellâ€™s completion, the spirit must make a saving throw using the higher of its Constitution, Wisdom, or Charisma.

On a success, nothing happens and the exorcism fails. On a failure, the creature takes 2d6 psychic damage and must make a second saving throw. If that throw succeeds, its hit point total is reduced by 2d6 and the attribute it used to make the saving throw is reduced by 1d4-1, and it cannot regain those hit points or attribute points for 1 week, but it remains within the body. You cannot attempt to exorcise it again until you have tak-en a short or long rest. On a failure, the spirit is exorcised.

Regardless of the outcome, you take 1d4 levels of exhaustion and 2d6 psychic dam-age.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell with a 5th-level or higher spell slot, the spirit rolls all saving throws at disadvantage.
