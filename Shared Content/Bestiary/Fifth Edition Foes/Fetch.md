## Description
A murdered person who is buried in frozen ground sometimes returns from the grave as a fetch, an evil undead monster with a hatred for fire and life. Fetches seek out living creatures that wander too close to their grave, kill them, and bury them in the hope that the victim will also rise as a fetch. Not all foes are buried, however; some are dragged to the fetch’s lair and devoured. Fetches savor the flesh of humanoids and monstrous humanoids—in particular humans, elves, and centaurs.

A fetch stands from 5 to 7 feet tall and weighs between 100 and 250 pounds. Its clothes are tattered and worn with age and exposure. Its rotting flesh is drawn tight around its bones and flushed grayish-white. Its hair is scraggly and frozen, and ice crystals cover its skin; the ice frozen onto and into its flesh gives it a small bit of armor protection. A fetch’s eyes are stark blue.

A fetch is a ruthless opponent. They always fight to the death, unless they are threatened with fire. If they can’t quickly defeat someone who attacks them with fire, they flee. Afterward, the fetch trails the hated foe (relatively easy across snow), waiting for a chance to take it by surprise and destroy the source of heat.
