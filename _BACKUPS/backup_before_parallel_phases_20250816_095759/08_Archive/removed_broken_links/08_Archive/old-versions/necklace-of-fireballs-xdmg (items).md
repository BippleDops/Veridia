--- # Necklace of Fireballs

*Wondrous item, rare* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/necklace-of-fireballs.webp#right) - **Weight**: 1.0 lbs. This necklace has``dice: 1d6` + 3`beads hanging from it. You can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a level 3 [fireball-xphb (spells)]] (save **DC 15**). You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, at one time. When you do so, increase the damage of the Fireball by`d6`for each bead after the first (maximum``dice: 12d6``). *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 280.
