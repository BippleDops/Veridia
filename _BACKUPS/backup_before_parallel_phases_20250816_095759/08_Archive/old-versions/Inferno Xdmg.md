--- # Inferno

*Generic Hazard* Whenever an uncontrolled fire spreads, it can create an inferno that quickly engulfs creatures, objects, and vegetation. An inferno consists of at least four contiguous 10-foot [[Cube Area of Effect Xphb]] of fire. Each of the inferno's 10-foot Cubes can be doused with 10 gallons of water. Exposure to a strong wind for 1 minute causes the inferno to grow, adding`d4`new 10-foot Cubes to its volume. An inferno deprived of fuel burns itself out after`d10`minutes. An inferno damages any vegetation or object that isn't being worn or carried that it touches, dealing 22 (``dice: 4d10``) Fire damage immediately and again at the end of each minute. Any creature that enters the inferno for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 22 (``dice: 4d10``) Fire damage and is burning. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 76* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Inferno xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
