## Description
This is an indispensable aid to the learned mapper, whose collection has grown unwieldy. Constructed of sturdy maple and trimmed in brass, this hinged case folds open to lay flat, providing two main compartments for flat and folded maps, as well as a series of tubes for those brittle, rolled-up maps that just wouldn’t survive otherwise. When the case is closed, there is a convenient handle for carrying, yet it’s small enough to go into a backpack. The case sells for 15 gp, or, for you moneyconscious souls, an oak version sells for 4 gp. Both cases have been sealed against the elements.
