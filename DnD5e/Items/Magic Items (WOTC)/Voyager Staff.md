# Voyager Staff

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Staff

**Rarity:** very rare

**Attunement**: *requires attunement* by a spellcaster

**Weight**: 4 lbs.

**Damage:** 1d6 bludgeoning versatile (1d8)

## Description

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic quarterstaff. While you hold it, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls.

This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff's charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [[banishment]]  (4 charges), [[blink]]  (3 charges), [[misty step]]  (2 charges), [[passwall]]  (5 charges), or [[teleport]]  (7 charges).

The staff regains `dice: 1d6 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice: d20`. On a 1, the staff vanishes forever.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
