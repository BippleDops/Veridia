# Heart of Stone (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *8th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 day

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a heart carved out of a precious stone worth at least 5,000 gp)

**Duration**: One year


## Effects
You replace your own heart with one made out of stone. Your heart continues to beat outside of your body and does not require any special care or treatment.

While this spell is in effect, you have re-sistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, resistance to paralysis and petrifaction, and are immune to exhaustion. Furthermore, you donâ€™t bleed and you age half as quickly as normal. However, you also lose the ability to heal naturally; you can only heal through magical means.

When this spell ends, either after a year or through other means, it instantly replaces the stone heart in your chest. If at any time your real heart is destroyed, you die instantly. Because of this, it is wise to place your heart somewhere very safe. The stone heart may be reused for this spell.
