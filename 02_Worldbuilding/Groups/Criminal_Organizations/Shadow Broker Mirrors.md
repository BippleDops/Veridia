## Overview
The Shadow Broker Mirrors is a specialized information syndicate that uses enchanted mirrors and reflection magic to gather, trade, and manipulate information throughout [[Aquabyssos]]. Operating from [[The Reflection Chamber]]â€”a hidden facility lined with thousands of scrying mirrorsâ€”they have built the most comprehensive intelligence network in the realm by exploiting the fact that every reflection can become a window into secrets.
