**Multiattack:** A shipbreaker can bite once, attack with its tail, and ram a ship (if its ram attack is available).

**Bite: Melee Attack:** +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 21 (`dice: 2d12+8`) piercing damage plus 11 (`dice: 2d10`) poison damage, and the target must make a successful DC 22 Strength saving throw or be grappled and restrained. A ship breakercan have up to two creatures grappled at a time. This attack scores a critical hit if the attack roll is a natural 19 or 20.

**Tail Slap: Melee Attack:** +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 19 (`dice: 2d10+8`) bludgeoning damage and the target is pushed 20 feet away from the sea serpent.

**Ram (Recharge 6):** Melee Attack: automatic hit, one ship. Hit: the vessel makes a Hull saving throw, using the most appropriate DC from the table below, based on the ships type. The vessel sinks when it has failed the listed number of saving throws. The proficiency bonus of the ships captain can be added to the saving throw.


| **Ship Type** | **Hull DC** | **Sinks After** |
|---|---|---|
| Rowboat | 20 | 1 failed save |

## Description
The sea serpents, great snakelike creatures that have roamed the oceans for ages, are nearly as old as the dragons that roam the sky. Unlike dragons, these great, scaly, serpentine beasts are products of natural evolution, though many scholars suspect magical influence, either deliberate or natural, somewhere in their evolution.

Sea serpents display great variation in size, color, intellect, and temperament. All of them, however, bear certain similarities. They are long, serpentine, warmblooded creatures that resemble snakes in appearance, though they also have two sets of flippers. On some sea serpents, these flippers are large and powerful, while on others they are so small and atrophied as to be almost unnoticeable. All sea serpents are aquatic, as their name implies, but they can survive for extended times out of water and some can even make their way about on land. Furthermore, all sea serpents are sentient, with intellects ranging from that of a smart dolphin to levels rivaling the smartest humans.

One trait that sea serpents share with dragons is a sense of innate superiority, a feeling that they are unequalled, unchallenged masters of the sea.

Unlike dragons, sea serpents are not distinguished by color or age. A few species are as acquisitive as dragons, but most have no interest in hoarding wealth or surrounding themselves with worshipful, lesser creatures. All sea serpents can speak and understand Aquatic, and many know Draconic as well. The more intelligent among them often learn the languages of nearby marine civilizations or the languages of seagoing surface dwellers.

In combat, most sea serpents use similar tactics. All have venomous bites, and all have the ability to trap prey in their coils and crush the life out of them the way a giant constrictor snake does. The largest sea serpents can even crush ships this way; mariners in their smoky dens delight in recounting tales of horror about great serpents that splintered mighty hulls and then gulped down the helpless sailors as they splashed in the water or sank into the brine.

Because they are intelligent, sea serpents can often be reasoned with or bargained with, if the bargainer has something the sea serpent wants and approaches as a supplicant, not an equal. They are adaptable to circumstances and never throw themselves into battle rashly.

The legendary shipbreaker is believed (and hoped!) to be the largest of the sea serpents, a true behemoth that rules the seas. It is a fearless hunter that enjoys attacking seagoing vessels and tearing out their hulls or capsizing them by ramming. It is believed by many sailors and seafarers that only one of these mighty beasts exists. Thankfully, it seems to spend most of its time hibernating.

A shipbreaker attacks ships and huge-sized creatures as its primary prey. It ignores smaller creatures except as snacks, or if directly threatened by one. Its favorite tactic is to either smash a ship’s hull with the shipbreaker’s massive snout or armored spine, or to crush the vessel by coiling the shipbreaker’s massive body around it, or to swamp it with a might slap of the creature’s tail. Once the vessel is destroyed and sinking, the shipbreaker feasts on the drowning sailors in the water.

The shipbreaker is most often sighted well out of sight from land. It has been known to shadow a ship for hours or days, letting its mere presence instill terror in the crew, as they know there’s no escape from the coming calamity.

It is unknown what language the shipbreaker speaks or understands, if any, because no one has ever reported hearing anything but terrifying bellows from it. In fact, the creature understands and can speak both Aquan and Common, but it almost never does. What could a mortal possibly say that would merit a response from the shipbreaker?

A shipbreaker can drag itself across reefs and even onto dry land with its broad, flat flippers, but it seldom has any reason to. If the shipbreaker is bent on destroying a ship and its crew, even taking shelter in a shallow lagoon or abandoning the ship entirely to seek safety on an island won’t stave off the shipbreaker’s fury.
