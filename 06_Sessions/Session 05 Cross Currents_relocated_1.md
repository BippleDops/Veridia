- -- # Session 5: [[Cross Currents * Level 5-6 Characters | 4-5 Hours | Exploration/Diplomacy/Mystery* ## 🔧 [Deep Evaluation]] Improvements * 20 targeted improvements identified* ### [[Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### [Enhancement Improvements]] - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## [[Session Overview The party's actions regarding the [Fourth Shard]] have sent ripples across both realms. Now they must navigate the treacherous waters between [[Aquabyssos|Aquabyssos and [Aethermoor|Aethermoor]] as both worlds react to the shifting balance of power. They'll encounter their first Aethermoor NPCs, discover that someone else seeks the [[Seven Shards for different purposes, and face the reality that their quest has implications far beyond what they initially understood. ## Opening: [The Tidal]] [[Embassy The session begins in the newly established **Cross-[Realm Embassy]]**, a marvel of magical engineering that exists simultaneously in both realms through ancient portal magic. Additionally, ### [[Read Aloud * The embassy is a wonder to behold - coral structures that somehow support crystalline spires, with currents of both water and air flowing through the same spaces without mixing. Aquabyssos citizens swim alongside Aethermoor wind-riders in an uneasy but functional coexistence.* * [[[Ambassador Elena]] Diplomatic|[[Ambassador Elena Diplomatic]], a stern woman whose robes seem to shift between flowing like water and billowing like wind, approaches your group with evident urgency.* ### [[Opening Information **[Ambassador Elena]]** delivers critical news:
- "Your actions at the [[Leviathan Graveyard have been... Noticed. By both realms."
- "Aethermoor's [Crystal Queen]] has sent envoys to discuss the 'mutual threat' your shard-seeking represents."
- "There are others seeking the [[Seven Shards - with very different intentions than yours."
- "We've arranged a meeting with Aethermoor representatives, but you should know: they believe you're working for [[[The Deep]] Mother|[[The Deep Mother]]." ### [[The Diplomatic [Challenge The]] party must convince the Aethermoor delegation that they're not agents of cosmic evil, while also learning what Aethermoor knows about the [[Seven Shards. ### [The Aethermoor]] Delegation **[[[[Captain Azure Windcaller|[Captain Azure]] Windcaller]]** - [[Lead Aethermoor diplomat, a wind-rider with crystal-enhanced armor and deep suspicions about Aquabyssos. **[[[Artificer Prism]] Lightweaver|[[Artificer Prism Lightweaver]]** - Crystal technician who has been monitoring dimensional disturbances caused by shard activations. **[[[[Storm Warden [Gale Farwatch]]|[[Storm Warden [Gale Farwatch]]]]** - Military advisor convinced that Aquabyssos is preparing for war. ### [[The Negotiation Scene **[Skill Challenge]]**: [[Diplomatic Relations (6 successes before 3 failures) - **Persuasion **DC 15****: Appeal to shared interests
- **Insight **DC 12****: Read the delegation's true concerns
- **History **DC 18****: Reference ancient cooperation between realms
- **[Arcana|Arcana]] **DC 16****: Demonstrate understanding of the magical threats
- **Intimidation **DC 20****: Show strength without being threatening (disadvantage due to context) ## Act 2: [[The Cross-[Realm Investigation]] Based on the diplomatic outcome, the party gains access to investigate the cross-realm mysteries. ### Option A: [[Aethermoor Alliance ([Successful Diplomacy]]) If the party succeeds in diplomacy, they gain:
- **[[Joint Investigation Team**: Aethermoor NPCs join as temporary allies
- **Cross-[Realm Travel]] Permits**: Ability to visit both realms freely
- **[[Shared Intelligence**: [Maps|Maps]] showing suspected shard locations in both realms
- **Warning about the [[Shadow Merchants**: Leads to investigate the criminal connection ### Option B: [Grudging Cooperation]] ([[Partial Success) If the party partially succeeds:
- **[Limited Access]]**: Can visit Aethermoor but with escorts
- **[[Conditional Information**: Gets some intelligence in exchange for favors
- **Surveillance**: Aethermoor agents will be watching the party
- **[Individual Contacts]]**: Some delegation members privately offer help ### Option C: [[Failed Negotiations ([Diplomatic Failure]]) If diplomacy fails:
- **[[Restricted Movement**: Cannot freely travel to Aethermoor
- **[Information Blackout]]**: Must find alternative sources
- **[[Increased Suspicion**: Both realms' authorities become wary
- **[Underground Routes]]**: Must work with smugglers and criminals ## [[Investigation Phase: [The Shadow]] [[Merchants Regardless of diplomatic outcome, the party learns about mysterious merchants who have been secretly facilitating the search for shards. ### Clue 1: [The Twilight]] Market **[[location|Location**: [[[Border Nexus]] [[Trading Post|[Border Nexus]] [[Trading Post]] A hidden market that exists in the spaces between realms, accessible only during certain tidal and wind conditions. **Key NPCs**:
- **[[[[Merchant Shade Voidbargain|[Merchant Shade]] Voidbargain]]**: A mysterious figure whose face is never clearly visible, deals in "impossible things"
- **[[[[Information Broker [Whisper Goldtongue]]|[[Information Broker [Whisper Goldtongue]]]]**: Traffics in secrets between the realms
- **[[[[Smuggler Captain [Marina Darkwater]]|[[Smuggler Captain [Marina Darkwater]]]]**: Runs goods and people across realm boundaries ### Encounter: [[Market Infiltration The party must infiltrate the [Twilight Market]] to learn about the [[Shadow Merchants' activities. **[Skill Challenge]]**: [[Market Infiltration (4 successes before 2 failures) - **Stealth **DC 14****: Move through market unnoticed
- **Deception **DC 16****: Pose as interested buyers
- **Investigation **DC 15****: Gather information from vendors
- **Sleight of Hand **DC 18****: [plant|Plant]] surveillance devices
- **Insight **DC 13****: Identify which merchants are working together ### Clue 2: [[The Corrupted [Courier The]] party encounters **[[[[Courier Swift Current|[Courier Swift]] Current]]**, an Aquabyssos messenger who was corrupted while carrying messages between [[The Collector's agents. **Encounter**: - **[Swift Current]]** (use Scout stats, but with psychic corruption abilities) - 2 **[[Shadow Touched** (use Shadow stats, but they're trying to help Swift by feeding on her corruption)
- Environmental hazard: The corruption creates unstable reality patches ### Intelligence from [Swift Current]] If saved/helped:
- **[[The Collector's Identity**: A high-ranking noble from Aethermoor named [[[Lord Aurelius]] Voidcrown|[[Lord Aurelius Voidcrown]]
- **[[The Plan**: [The Collector]] wants to use the [[Seven Shards to merge the realms permanently
- **[The Deadline]]**: Must be completed before the "[[Stellar Convergence" in three months
- **[The Fifth]] Shard**: Located in the floating city of [[[[Nimbus Sanctum|[Nimbus Sanctum]]]], heavily guarded ### [[The Stellar [Convergence Discovery]] Through investigation, the party learns about an astronomical event that occurs once every thousand years, when the cosmic forces that separate the realms are at their weakest. **[[[[Oracle Temporal Wisdom|[Oracle Temporal]] Wisdom]]** at the **Cross-[[Realm Observatory** explains: - [The Seven]] Shards aren't just powerful artifacts - they're keys to fundamental forces
- During the [[Stellar Convergence, the shards can be used to permanently alter reality
- [The Deep]] Mother's awakening and the Collector's plan are racing toward the same deadline
- The party is caught between two cosmic-level threats ### [[Read Aloud * [The Oracle]]'s eyes reflect not just starlight, but the patterns of possibility itself. When she speaks, her words seem to echo from multiple timelines.* * "Child, you stand at the confluence of three currents. [[The Deep Mother stirs to reclaim what was hers. [The Collector]] seeks to reshape reality in his image. And the [[Stellar Convergence approaches, when all barriers become permeable. Your choices in the coming days will determine whether the realms survive as separate worlds, merge into something new, or fall into eternal shadow."* ## [Major Decision]]: [[The Alliance [Question The]] party must choose their approach to these revelations: ## [[Climactic Encounter: [The Nexus]] [[Guardian As the party prepares to leave the [Border Nexus]], they're confronted by **[[[[The Convergence Guardian|[The Convergence]] Guardian]]**, an ancient entity that has been monitoring the shard activities. ### [[The Guardian's Challenge **Stats**: [Use Ancient]] [[Metallic Dragon template with these modifications: - **Type**: [construct|Construct]]/[[celestial|Celestial
- **HP**: 250
- **AC**: 20 ([Natural Armor]])
- **Speed**: 40 ft., fly 80 ft.
- **[[Damage Immunities**: Force, Radiant
- **[Condition Immunities]]**: Charmed, [[Exhaustion|Exhaustion, Frightened
- **Challenge**: 12 (8,400 XP) **[Special Abilities]]**:
- **[[Reality Anchor**: Can cast *dispel magic* at will as a 9th-level spell
- **[Temporal Sight]]**: Cannot be surprised, always acts first in initiative
- **[[Shard Resoce**: Deals extra `dice: 2d8` force damage to anyone carrying a shard
- **[Phase Shift]]**: Can become incorporeal for one round (recharge 5-6) ### [[The Guardian's [Test Rather]] than a fight to the death, this is a test of the party's worthiness and understanding: 1. **Round 1-3**: [[The Guardian attacks but pulls its punches, testing combat capability 2. **Round 4-6**: [The Guardian]] presents moral dilemmas as illusions while fighting
3. **Round 7+**: If the party shows wisdom and restraint, the Guardian offers knowledge instead of continued combat ### [[Resolution Options **[Combat Victory]]**: Party proves their strength but learns limited information **[[Diplomacy Success**: Party demonstrates wisdom and gains valuable intelligence: - The location of the [Sixth Shard]]
- Warnings about [[The Collector's true nature
- A protective charm against realm-crossing side effects
- An ally who will provide warnings about cosmic threats **[Moral Failure]]**: Party shows they're not ready for the responsibility, loses access to certain information and opportunities ### [[Future Session Setup - The party should end this session with clear short-term goals
- Multiple plot threads should be active but manageable
- Set up the shift from investigation to more active opposition - -- * "When currents cross, wise swimmers accomplish not fight the flow - they use the confluence to reach deeper waters than either current alone could provide."* - [Ambassador Elena]] Diplomatic ## Related * Links to related content will be added here.* ## [[Prophecy Connection Mentioned in [The Second]] Prophecy of Winds ## [[Pronunciation Guide]] - **Both**: [BOTH]
