# Climbing
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 363. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

While you're climbing, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in [difficult terrain](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md)). You ignore this extra cost if you have a [Climb Speed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/climb-speed-xphb.md) and use it to climb. At the DM's option, climbing a slippery surface or one with few handholds might require a successful DC 15 Strength ([Athletics](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Athletics)) check.

## Adventure Hooks
