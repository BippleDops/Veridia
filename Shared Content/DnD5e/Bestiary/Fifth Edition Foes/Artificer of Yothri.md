# Artificer of Yothri
## Overview
### Artificer of Yothri

![[nxzgwh4i.ux5.png|Artificer of Yothri|300]]
[[nxzgwh4i.ux5.png|open outside]]

*The artificers of Yothri are tall and skeletal, a construction of dark-hued metalloid bones acting as the framework for artificial tubes and organs. They wear hoods and long, black robes— perhaps a necessity on the dead world they inhabit in a distant and eroding reality.*

**Alignment**: Chaotic Evil

**Armor Class**: 16 (natural armor)

**Hit Points**: 66 (`dice: 12d8+12`)

**Speed**: 20 ft.

**Challenge**: CR 5

**Experience**: 1,800 XP

## Other Details

**Skills**: Intimidation +5, Stealth +5

**Senses**: blindsight 60 ft.

**Languages**: Any

**Size**: Medium

## Actions

**Multiattack:** An artificer of Yothri attacks twice with claws.

**Melee Attack—Claw:** +5 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d12 + 2` slashing damage.

## Special Traits

**Spellcasting:** The artificers of Yothri replicate the effects of magic with their alien science (that only they are capable of understanding). They have the spellcasting capability of 9thlevel wizards, but their spellcasting requires no components. They use Intelligence as their casting ability (DC 16, attack +8). Typical spells are listed below, but individual artificers can know different spells.

- Cantrips (at will): *[[mage hand]], [[shocking grasp]]*

- 1st Level (x4): *[[charm person]], [[mage armor]], [[ray of sickness]], [[sleep]]*

- 2nd Level (x3): *[[mirror image]], [[see invisibility]]*

- 3rd Level (x3): *[[counterspell]], [[protection from energy]]*

- 4th Level (x3): *[[dimension door]], [[wall of fire]]*

- 5th Level (x1): *[[telekinesis]]*

## Ecology

**Environment**: Any

**Organization**: Solitary or expedition (1 artificer plus a work gang of amphorons)

## Description

The artificers originate on Yothri, a distant world—perhaps an alien dimension—where reality itself is crumbling. They live in baroque palaces of green glass and alien metal, twisted into unnatural shapes, domes, and bubbles. The artificers are mutually hostile, each coveting the others’ resources and knowledge. It is remotely possible that player characters might be kidnapped to serve an artificer by attacking the citadel of a rival artificer in the barren, suppurating wastelands of Yothri.

Artificers employ the Science of Yothri, which is a mix of psychic power, alien magic, and unfathomable technology impossible to achieve outside the decaying physical reality of Yothri itself.

An artificer might be encountered alone if he or she hopes to avoid attracting attention, but more often, they travel with a work gang of amphorons for protection and to handle all physical labor. They can maintain a mental connection with a controller amphoron anywhere in the universe, including on other planes of existence. (See the entry “Amphorons of Yothri” for more information on such connections.)
