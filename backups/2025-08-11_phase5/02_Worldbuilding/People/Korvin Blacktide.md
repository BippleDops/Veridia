## Overview
Ambassador Korvin Blacktide embodies the intersection of military prowess and diplomatic finesse that defines Aquabyssos's approach to international relations. A decorated war veteran turned skilled negotiator, Korvin represents his empire's interests with the strategic mind of a general and the silver tongue of a career diplomat. His imposing triton physique and commanding presence make him equally at home on the battlefield and in the negotiation chamber.

## Physical Description & Background
Standing 6'3" with the powerful build of a career soldier, Korvin cuts an impressive figure in both military uniform and diplomatic regalia. His deep blue-green skin bears ceremonial scarring from his military service, and his silver-streaked hair is kept in the traditional triton warrior's knot. His most distinctive features are his piercing golden eyes and the ceremonial trident he carries as both weapon and symbol of office.

Born into a military family, Korvin distinguished himself in the Depth Wars before transitioning to diplomatic service. His unique combination of combat experience and political acumen made him invaluable in negotiations with hostile powers. He has spent the last decade representing Aquabyssos in increasingly delicate diplomatic situations.

## Special Abilities

**Diplomatic Immunity.** Korvin has advantage on saves against charm and fear effects from creatures of lower political rank. Hostile actions against him risk triggering diplomatic incidents.

**Battle Master Tactics.** Can use Combat Superiority dice (5d10) for various maneuvers including Commanding Presence (allies gain bonus to attacks), Tactical Assessment (learn enemy weaknesses), and Intimidating Strike.

**Triton Heritage.** Can breathe air and water, has resistance to cold damage, and can cast *fog cloud* once per day.

**Spellcasting (Paladin-like).** Can cast: *command*, *zone of truth*, *detect lies*, *suggestion* (3 uses each per long rest).

## Actions

**Multiattack.** Makes three attacks with Diplomatic Trident or two attacks and casts a spell.

**Diplomatic Trident.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 11 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) additional damage based on situation (radiant vs evil creatures, psychic vs lying creatures).

**Commanding Presence (3/Day).** All allies within 30 feet gain advantage on their next attack and add +5 damage.

**Diplomatic Ultimatum (1/Day).** Forces one creature to make DC 17 Wisdom save or be compelled to negotiate in good faith for 1 hour.

## Current Activities

- Managing the delicate relationship with [[Envoy Blackwater Jr.]] and other diplomatic rivals
- Investigating reports of shadow corruption in diplomatic channels
- Building military alliances to counter growing threats from both realms

## Relationships
- **[[Senator Cordelia Deepcurrent]]** - Political ally and occasional romantic interest
- **[[Admiral Thorne Blackwater]]** - Former military colleague, now concerned about Blackwater family corruption
- **[[Emperor Thalassius the Wise]]** - Serves loyally despite disagreeing with some policies
- **Surface World Diplomats** - Maintains professional relationships across multiple nations

## Services & Resources
- **Military Intelligence** - Access to Aquabyssos defense information
- **Diplomatic Channels** - Can arrange meetings between hostile parties
- **Trade Negotiations** - Expertise in complex economic agreements
- **Cultural Translation** - Understanding of customs across multiple realms and nations

## Adventure Hooks
1. **The Diplomatic Crisis** - Korvin needs discrete agents to investigate sabotage of peace negotiations
2. **The Military Conspiracy** - Evidence suggests a coup plot within Aquabyssos's military leadership
3. **The Shadow Infiltration** - Diplomatic staff are being corrupted by shadow entities
4. **The Trade War** - Economic warfare threatens to escalate into actual military conflict
5. **The Missing Envoy** - A diplomatic mission has vanished, threatening international relations

## Secrets & Motivations
- Secretly believes Aquabyssos is becoming too aggressive and wants to moderate imperial policy
- Has developed feelings for [[Senator Cordelia Deepcurrent]] despite political complications
- Maintains private correspondence with surface world leaders about potential peaceful solutions
- Fears the growing influence of shadow-touched individuals in government
- Plans to retire from diplomacy to return to military service if war becomes inevitable

## Roleplaying Notes
**Voice**: Deep, commanding, with perfect diction. Speaks slowly when making important points.
**Mannerisms**: Touches his ceremonial trident when thinking, stands with military bearing, uses nautical metaphors.
**Speaking Patterns**: "In the interest of both our peoples...", "My military experience suggests...", "We must navigate these troubled waters carefully..."

Korvin represents honor and duty in a world of increasing moral complexity, serving as both a potential ally and obstacle depending on the party's goals and methods.
