--- > [!figure] View # Thornwhisper Manor - The Unfrozen Estate *A pocket of preserved time in the depths of corruption* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview Thornwhisper Manor stands as a haunting monument to desperate love and temporal magic gone wrong. Once the grand estate of [[Lady Vivienne Thornwhisper]], this magnificent underwater mansion exists in a state of temporal suspension, caught between moments when the lady attempted to save her family from the encroaching corruption. Now known as "The Unfrozen Estate," it serves as both a treasure trove of pre-corruption artifacts and a deadly maze of temporal anomalies. ## Physical Description The manor is a sprawling complex of interconnected coral towers and kelp gardens, all suspended in shimmering bubbles of frozen time. The architecture represents the height of pre-corruption [[Aquabyssos]] nobility: ### [[Lady Vivienne Thornwhisper]] - "The Unfrozen"

The entire estate exists within overlapping temporal effects:
- **Time Dilation**: Some rooms experience time slower or faster than normal

- **Chronological Instability**: Past, present, and future blend together
- **Memory Stones**: Crystals that record and replay past events ### Temporal Anomalies

[[Lady Vivienne Thornwhisper]] believes she can reverse the corruption using temporal magic, but needs the party to retrieve the [[Heart of Chronos]] from the [[Time Gardens of Aethermoor]]. She offers temporal magic knowledge in exchange.
**Reward**: Unique temporal spells + Temporal Anchor staff ### The Family's Release

The lady's family begs for freedom from their temporal prison, but releasing them might allow corruption to finish claiming them. The party must find a way to break the time lock safely while preserving their lives.
**Reward**: 1,500 gp + grateful noble family's influence ### The Corruption's Origin

Documents in the manor suggest the corruption began with a specific ritual performed by [[The Corrupted Admiralty]]. Lady Vivienne needs the party to investigate and potentially travel back in time to prevent it.
**Reward**: 2,000 gp + ability to alter one past event ### The Temporal Artifact

A powerful artifact called the [[Crown of Endless Moments]] is hidden somewhere in the manor's temporal maze. Multiple factions seek it for different purposes. The party must navigate the hazards and compete with other treasure hunters.
**Reward**: Major magical artifact + elimination of rival faction ### The Memory Thief

Someone is stealing specific memories from the manor's temporal echoes, weakening the time barriers and allowing corruption to seep in. The party must identify and stop the thief before the manor's protection fails completely.
**Reward**: 800 gp + preserved memories containing vital intelligence ## Player-Facing Summary Lady Vivienne the Unfrozen is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Lady Vivienne the Unfrozen as a nexus where past and present converge.

Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
