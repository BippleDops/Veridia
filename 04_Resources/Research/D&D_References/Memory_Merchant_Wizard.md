The Memory Merchant represents a unique magical tradition that treats memories as valuable commodities to be bought, sold, traded, and refined. These wizards have mastered the complex magic of consciousness, memory, and identity, operating in the gray areas between legitimate magical services and dangerous mental manipulation. They serve as information brokers, trauma healers, and occasionally as agents of more sinister memory-related conspiracies. ## Core Concept

Memory Merchants are wizards who specialize in enchantment and divination magic related to consciousness and memory. They can extract painful memories to ease trauma, implant knowledge and skills, create perfect memory storage devices, and even trade memories between willing participants. Many operate legitimate businesses helping people recover from trauma or acquire new abilities, while others work in shadowy networks dealing in stolen memories and forbidden knowledge. ### Arcane Tradition: School of Memory Commerce

At 2nd level, Memory Merchant Wizards join the School of Memory Commerce: ### Feature: Memory Network

You have contacts throughout the memory trade industry, including legitimate therapists, gray market operators, and black market dealers. You can find buyers for unusual memories, locate specific types of memories for purchase, and access information about memory-related crimes and investigations. ### Wizard/Enchantment Bard

Enhanced social manipulation and memory-related performance abilities. ### Wizard/Great Old One Warlock

Eldritch patron provides access to alien memories and consciousness techniques. Meanwhile, ### Wizard/Knowledge Cleric

Divine magic enhances memory preservation and consciousness protection abilities. ### Wizard/Aberrant Mind Sorcerer

Natural psychic abilities complement learned memory manipulation techniques. ## Ethical Complexity

Memory Merchants operate in morally complex territory, balancing legitimate healing services with potentially exploitative commercial activities. Players should work with DMs to explore themes of identity, consciousness, and the commodification of experience while maintaining appropriate campaign tone. This build offers rich roleplay opportunities around memory, identity, and the ethics of consciousness manipulation. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*
