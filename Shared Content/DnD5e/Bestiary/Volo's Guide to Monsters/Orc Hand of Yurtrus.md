## Description
Yurtrus is the ore god of death and disease. He is a horrifying abomination covered in rot and infection, except for his perfect, smooth white hands.

Ore priests that oversee the line between life and death are known by the others in the tribe as hands of Yurtrus. They dwell on the fringes of an ore lair, usually communing with other ores through the auspices of those who follow Luthic. The hands of Yurtrus wear pale gloves made of the bleached skin of other humanoids (preferably elves), symbolizing their connection with Yurtrus, and are sometimes called "white hands" as a result.

Every ore knows that the hands ofYurtrus are the tribe's gateway to the ancestors. Ores who die having served the tribe well go on to rituals meant to send them to Gruumsh's realm.

As befits followers of a god who doesn't speak, hands of Yurtrus remove their tongues to emulate their deity, for a reason similar to why an eye of Gruumsh puts out one of its eyes.
