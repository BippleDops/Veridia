--- # Cone [Area of Effect]

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 364. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* A Cone is an area of effect that extends in straight lines from a point of origin in a direction its creator chooses. A Cone's width at any point along its length is equal to that point's distance from the point of origin. For example, a Cone is 15 feet wide at a point along its length that is 15 feet from the point of origin. The effect that creates a Cone specifies its maximum length. A Cone's point of origin isn't included in the area of effect unless its creator decides otherwise. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Cone area of effect xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
