--- # Quaal's Feather Token, Whip

*Wondrous item, rare* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/quaals-feather-token-whip.webp#right) This object looks like a feather. You can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then take a [Action Xphb]] to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes``dice: 1d6` + 5`Force damage. As a [[Action Xphb, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you take a [actions#Magic|Magic]] action to dismiss it, or when you die or have the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated condition. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 290.
