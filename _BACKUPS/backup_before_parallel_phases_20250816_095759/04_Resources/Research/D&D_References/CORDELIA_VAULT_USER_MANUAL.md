- **Active Voice**: Character actions drive descriptions
- **Sensory Integration**: Include sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste when relevant
- **Cultural Authenticity**: Maintain realm-specific language patterns and values **Example - Poor**:

> Captain Smith was a naval officer. He commanded ships. He was important. **Example - Good**:

> Captain Marina Tidecaller commands the *Deep Current*, her weathered hands still steady on the wheel despite thirty years battling the crushing depths. Her crew follows her not from duty alone, but because she has never lost a sailor to the abyss—and in Aquabyssos, that reputation means everything. #### Metadata Standards **Required Frontmatter**:```yaml

---

type: [NPC|Location|Faction|Quest|Item|Lore|Session]
world: [Aquabyssos|Aethermoor|Both]
status: [complete|draft|stub|needs-review]
tags: [relevant, descriptive, tags]
created: 2025-08-13
updated: 2025-08-13

--- **Optional Enriching Metadata**:

---

# Relationship tracking

relationships: - [[Character Name: ally - [Organization]]: member # Timeline integration

timeline_period: "Contemporary Era"
campaign_relevance: "main-plot" # Mechanical information

challenge_rating: 12
encounter_type: "social"
environment: "underwater" # Cross-references

related_quests: ["[[Quest Name]]"]
affects_factions: ["[[Faction Name]]"]

--- #### Link Strategy **Effective Linking Principles**:

1. **Link Sparingly but Meaningfully**: Every link should add value
2. **First Mention Rule**: Link the first mention of an entity in each document
3. **Contextual Relevance**: Only link when the relationship matters
4. **Avoid Over-linking**: Too many links reduce readability and impact
5. **Use Aliases Appropriately**:`[[Full Official Name|Short Reference]]`**Link Categories**:

- **Essential Links**: Core relationships that define the entity
- **Reference Links**: Background information that enriches understanding
- **Plot Links**: Connections that advance storylines or create opportunities - **Cross-Realm Links**: Connections between Aquabyssos and Aethermoor content #### Session Preparation Efficiency **Pre-Session Template Workflow** (20 minutes maximum):

1. **Quick Timeline Check** (3 minutes): What's happening in the world?
2. **NPC Status Update** (5 minutes): Where are key characters and what do they want?
3. **Plot Thread Review** (5 minutes): What storylines are active?
4. **Resource Preparation** (7 minutes): What materials might you need? **During-Session Efficiency**:

- **Use Automation Tools**: Generate content on-demand rather than over-preparing
- **Focus on Reactions**: Prepare NPC motivations, not specific scenes
- **Embrace Improvisation**: Use the vault as inspiration, not a script
- **Document Key Decisions**: Note important choices and consequences for later processing #### Information Management **Player Information Flow**:

- **Common Knowledge**: What any character would reasonably know
- **Professional Knowledge**: Information relevant to character backgrounds
- **Discovery Knowledge**: Secrets revealed through investigation and roleplay
- **Restricted Knowledge**: Information requiring specific access or relationships **NPC Information Consistency**:
- **What They Know**: Information available to the NPC based on position and relationships
- **What They Share**: Information they're willing or likely to reveal
- **What They Hide**: Secrets they actively conceal and reasons why
- **What They Misunderstand**: Incomplete or incorrect information they believe #### Consequence Management **Immediate Consequences** (This Session):

- Environmental and social reactions to character actions
- NPC attitude and relationship changes
- Information availability adjustments
- Resource gains or losses **Session-to-Session Consequences** (1-3 sessions):
- NPC goal adjustments based on character interference
- Faction relationship shifts and political developments - World event triggers from accumulated character actions
- New opportunities and complications arising from character choices **Long-term Consequences** (Campaign arcs):
- Major world state changes from sustained character influence
- Faction power balance shifts and political realignments
- Historical event creation through character legacy
- Realm-wide cultural or technological changes #### Vault Organization **File Naming Conventions**:

- **Consistent Capitalization**: "Admiral Marina Stormcrest" not "admiral marina stormcrest"
- **Descriptive Names**: Include key identifiers ("Crystal Palace Throne Room")
- **No Special Characters**: Use spaces and letters only, avoid symbols
- **Logical Sorting**: Names that sort sensibly alphabetically **Directory Usage**:
- **People**: Individual characters (NPCs, rulers, important figures)
- **Places**: Geographic locations (cities, buildings, regions, realms)
- **Groups**: Organizations (factions, guilds, governments, cults) - **Items**: Physical objects (artifacts, equipment, documents, treasures)
- **Lore**: Concepts and knowledge (history, culture, magic, technology) #### Automation Best Practices **Backup Strategy**:

- **Full Backup**: Weekly comprehensive vault snapshots
- **Incremental Backup**: Daily changed-file backups
- **Session Backup**: Before and after each game session
- **Major Change Backup**: Before running significant automation or making bulk edits **System Monitoring**:
- **Regular Health Checks**: Weekly vault validation reports
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monthly system performance assessments
- **Error Log Review**: Weekly automation error analysis
- **Update Management**: Monthly system and configuration updates #### Quality Assurance **Content Validation Schedule**:

- **Pre-Session**: Quick validation of materials you'll use
- **Post-Session**: Validation of new content created during session
- **Weekly**: Comprehensive vault-wide validation report
- **Monthly**: Deep quality assessment with manual review **Consistency Maintece**:
- **Cross-Reference Checking**: Ensure character details match across files
- **Timeline Accuracy**: Verify chronological consistency in events and relationships
- **Cultural Authenticity**: Maintain realm-specific details and social norms
- **Mechanical Accuracy**: Keep game statistics and rules consistent --- ### Getting Help **First Steps for Issues**:
