# Unite the Emperor
*Lord Commander Octavius Thalassion VII, The Scattered Crown, The Last Emperor's Voice*

## Overview
Lord Commander Octavius Thalassion VII represents the most legitimate claim to reuniting the fractured imperial throne of Aquabyssos. As the great-nephew of [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Emperor Thalassius the Wise]], he carries both the bloodline and the burden of imperial restoration. Unlike pretenders seeking personal power, Octavius genuinely believes in reuniting the scattered fragments of the empire not for conquest, but to restore the golden age of prosperity and stability that existed before [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Drowning]].

Operating from the deep political currents of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Abyssos Prime]], he leads a sophisticated campaign to gather the Seven Scattered Crowns - fragments of the original [[02_Worldbuilding/Items/Crown of Tidal Sovereignty]] that were broken and distributed to prevent any single ruler from wielding absolute power again. His approach combines political maneuvering, diplomatic alliances, and when necessary, strategic force to convince the current fragment holders that unity serves everyone's interests.

## Secrets
> [!warning] DM Only
> - His crown fragment is slowly merging with his consciousness, making him more imperial and less human
> - One of the Crown Fragment holders (Queen Nerida) is secretly his half-sister
> - He's discovered that reunifying the crown will require a willing sacrifice from each holder
> - The original breaking of the crown was done to prevent an ancient prophecy - reunification might trigger it
> - He's been having dreams/visions from the original Emperor Thalassius, possibly beyond death
> - The Tide Guard includes several members who are planning to assassinate fragment holders if diplomacy fails

## Current Activities
- Orchestrating the **Great Reconciliation Conference** to gather all fragment holders
- Negotiating trade agreements that demonstrate the benefits of imperial unity
- Researching ancient precedents for voluntary reunification
- Building popular support through public works and economic improvement
- Secretly investigating the original reasons for the crown's breaking

## Motivations
1. **Primary**: Restore imperial unity to create peace and prosperity for all depth-dwellers
2. **Secondary**: Honor his bloodline and the memory of Emperor Thalassius the Wise
3. **Hidden**: Prevent the growing threats (surface invasion, deep corruption, resource wars) that only unity can address
4. **Personal**: Prove that imperial blood means service to the people, not tyranny over them

## The Seven Crown Fragments Campaign
Octavius's master plan involves seven parallel diplomatic/political campaigns:

5. **Religious Harmony**: Working with various faiths to support reunification
6. **Gradual Integration**: Starting with loose confederation, moving toward full unity
7. **Voluntary Succession**: Each holder must willingly surrender their fragment

### Negotiation Approaches
