--- # Downtime Activity: Building a Stronghold

*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 128* A character can spend time between adventures building a stronghold. Before work can begin, the character must acquire a plot of land. If the estate lies within a kingdom or similar domain, the character will need a royal charter (a legal document granting permission to oversee the estate in the name of the crown), a land grant (a legal document bequeathing custody of the land to the character for as long as he or she remains loyal to the crown), or a deed (a legal document that serves as proof of ownership). Land can also be acquired by inheritance or other means. Royal charters and land grants are usually given by the crown as a reward for faithful service, although they can also be bought. Deeds can be bought or inherited. A small estate might sell for as little as 100 gp or as much as 1,000 gp. A large estate might cost 5,000 gp or more, if it can be bought at all. Once the estate is secured, a character needs access to building materials and laborers. The Building a Stronghold table shows the cost of building the stronghold (including materials and labor) and the amount of time it takes, provided that the character is using downtime to oversee construction. Work can continue while the character is away, but each day the character is away adds 3 days to the construction time. **Building a Stronghold** | Stronghold | Construction Cost | Construction Time |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Abbey | 50,000 gp | 400 days |
| Guildhall, town or city | 5,000 gp | 60 days |
| Keep or small castle | 50,000 gp | 400 days |
| Noble estate with manor | 25,000 gp | 150 days |
| Outpost or fort | 15,000 gp | 100 days |
| Palace or large castle | 500,000 gp | 1,200 days |
| Temple | 50,000 gp | 400 days |
| Tower, fortified | 15,000 gp | 100 days |
| Trading post | 5,000 gp | 60 days |
