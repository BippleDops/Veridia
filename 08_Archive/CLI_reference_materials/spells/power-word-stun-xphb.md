# Power Word Stun
*8th-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You overwhelm the mind of one creature you can see within range. If the target has 150 [Hit Points](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or fewer, it has the [Stunned](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Stunned) condition. Otherwise, its [Speed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) is 0 until the start of your next turn.

The [Stunned](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Stunned) target makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the condition on itself on a success.

**Classes**: [Warlock](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Sorcerer](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Wizard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
