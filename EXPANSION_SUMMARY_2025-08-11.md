## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- Building on existing infrastructure rather than recreating
- Deep, interconnected systems over surface-level coverage
- Maintaining compatibility with existing tools
- Creating both player and GM facing content
- Providing multiple complexity levels

### Areas for Improvement
- Visual assets remain largely absent
- Some systems may be too complex for casual use
- Documentation could benefit from video tutorials
- Need better quick-reference materials
- Some edge cases not fully addressed

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Use
1. Review new systems with players
2. Integrate gradually (don't use everything at once)
3. Start with Memory Trading as easy entry point
4. Use Reality Merger for dramatic moments
5. Let Faction Warfare run in background

### For Continued Development
1. Prioritize visual assets for main NPCs
2. Create simplified reference sheets
3. Develop example scenarios
4. Build pre-generated content
5. Establish regular update schedule

## Conclusion

This expansion transforms the vault from a collection of notes into a comprehensive campaign system. The new mechanics reinforce the unique aspects of the Aquabyssos & Aethermoor setting while providing practical tools for gameplay. The depth-focused approach ensures that each system can support extensive gameplay while maintaining internal consistency.

The vault now contains:
- Complete mechanical frameworks for all major campaign elements
- Integrated tracking and management tools
- Comprehensive player and GM resources
- Clear navigation and organization
- Scalable complexity for different play styles

This positions the campaign for successful long-term play with rich, mechanically-supported storytelling.
