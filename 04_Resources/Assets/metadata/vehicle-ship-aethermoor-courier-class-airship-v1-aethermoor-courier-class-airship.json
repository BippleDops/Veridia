  "revised_prompt": "Imagine a painting that portrays an Aethermoor Courier-Class Airship from a beloved fantasy tabletop role-playing game, akin to Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition. Be sure to draw upon a grounded, medieval-fantasy aesthetic and avoid any hints of modern technology. Render the airship in a consistent, illustrative, traditional paintbrush style with a focus on cultural coherence and craftmanship. Sketch a detailed top, side, and cross-section view of the airship, showing off the design of the ballast, pressure hulls, and engines, as well as spaces for the crew. Capture the essence of the ship's classic fantasy nautical and aeronautical design, emphasizing materials common in this realm, such as cloudstone and polished brass, shaped by the winds into smooth, flowing forms. Despite the realism, infuse the scene with a touch of romanticism that evokes the awe and drama of skyward adventure. The color palette should lean on navy, gold, and cloud-white and be highlighted with warm hues suggesting sunlight. Remember to make the blueprint crisp and legible, using numbered callout pins (01, 02, 03...) in place of lengthy text labels, and include a comprehensible legend area without complex paragraphs. All symbols should be meaningful, and there should be no nonsensical letter combinations, scientific user interfaces, signs from the modern era, hyper-real CGI, or anime influence. The image should not contain bloom glare or any artifacts as well.",
