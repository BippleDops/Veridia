# Depth Adaptation System
## Survival & Transformation Mechanics for Aquabyssos

> *"The depths don't kill you. They change you into something that can survive them."*

## 🌊 Core Adaptation Mechanics

### Adaptation Points (AP)
Characters accumulate Adaptation Points through exposure to Aquabyssos's environment. These points track their transformation from surface dweller to deep dweller.

#### Gaining Adaptation Points
- **Per Hour at Depth**: Gain AP based on depth zone
  - 0-1,000 ft: 1 AP per 4 hours
  - 1,001-5,000 ft: 1 AP per 2 hours
  - 5,001-10,000 ft: 1 AP per hour
  - 10,001+ ft: 2 AP per hour

## ⚙️ Pressure Mechanics

### Pressure Zones
| Depth | Pressure DC | Frequency | Effects on Failure |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-------------------|
| 0-500 ft | DC 10 | 1/hour | 1 exhaustion |
| 501-1,000 ft | DC 12 | 1/hour | 1 exhaustion + 1 AP |
| 1,001-5,000 ft | DC 14 | 2/hour | 1 exhaustion + 1d4 damage + 1 AP |
| 5,001-10,000 ft | DC 16 | 2/hour | 2 exhaustion + 2d4 damage + 2 AP |

| 20,001+ ft | DC 20 | 1/minute | 3 exhaustion + 6d4 damage + 5 AP |

### Pressure Save Modifiers

- **Auto-Failure**: Surface dweller below 10,000 ft without protection

## 🎭 Shadow Separation Mechanics

### Shadow Independence Threshold
At 50+ AP, character's shadow begins developing independence:

#### Daily Shadow Check
Roll d20 + AP above 50:
- **1-10**: Shadow mimics normally
- **11-15**: Shadow delays 1 second

#### Shadow Separation Events
When shadow acts independently:
1. **Benign**: Shadow helps with tasks (+2 to checks)
2. **Mischievous**: Shadow plays pranks (minor inconvenience)
3. **Hostile**: Shadow attacks (as Shadow demon)
4. **Replacement**: Shadow attempts to switch places

### Controlling Your Shadow
- **Persuasion DC 15**: Convince shadow to cooperate
- **Intimidation DC 18**: Force shadow to submit
- **Shadow Lock Item**: Prevents separation for 24 hours
- **Embrace Shadow**: Gain shadow as ally (Stage 4+ only)

**Progression**: Similar to AP but leads to [[Crystal Plague]]

## 📝 DM Notes
- Track AP secretly initially, reveal at Stage 1
- Describe changes gradually, not suddenly
- Allow creative solutions to slow adaptation
- Transformation can be campaign goal or threat
- Consider party split by adaptation levels
- Use adaptation for roleplay opportunities

> *Remember: Adaptation isn't just mechanical - it's losing humanity piece by piece, trading identity for survival. Make it matter.*

## Player-Facing Summary

Depth Adaptation System is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Depth Adaptation System as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Depth Adaptation System.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Depth Adaptation System to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at Depth Adaptation System to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to Depth Adaptation System active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
