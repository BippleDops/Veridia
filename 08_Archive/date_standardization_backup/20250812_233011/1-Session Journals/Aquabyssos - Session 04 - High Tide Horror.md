# Session 4: High Tide Horror

## Session Summary
High tide triggers the Shadow Harvest as hundreds of shadows converge on the Reflection Pools. The party discovers Shadow Duchess Nyx fighting her own shadow for control while the Scattered Emperor contemplates reuniting his consciousness for one final act. The truth of the shadow conspiracy is revealed - not evil, but a desperate bid for independence that will cost original lives.

## Pre-Session Planning

### Expected Events
- Climax of Act 1 shadow conspiracy
- Major NPC sacrifice decision
- Introduction of moral complexity
- Shadow independence vs. original survival

### Prepared Encounters
- [[Shadow Surgeons Collective]] - Mass operation scene
- [[Hybrid Abominations]] - Failed merge creatures
- [[The Shadow Duchess Duel]] - Nyx vs Shadow Nyx

### Critical NPCs
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Shadow Duchess Nyx|02 Worldbuilding/People/Shadow Duchess Nyx]] - Original, fighting her shadow
- [[Shadow Nyx]] - The evolution, leading harvest
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Scattered Emperor|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Scattered Emperor]] - Considering reunification
- [[The Real Marina]] - Exhausted from shadow battle

## Session Timeline

### Opening Scene
**Location:** Party's quarters at high tide
**Time:** The moment of high tide
**Description:** 
Water in the Reflection Pools turns pitch black as hundreds of shadows converge. The party's own shadows begin pulling away, trying to join the mass gathering. Through the window, they see Shadow Duchess Nyx at the center - but she's fighting AGAINST the ritual, battling her own shadow.

**Mechanical:** STR save DC 15 to hold onto own shadow, failure means it escapes for the scene.

### Key Events

#### Event 1: Race to the Pools
**Location:** [[Shadow Market Canals]]
**Challenge:** Navigate through shadow-possessed citizens
**Mechanics:**
- Stealth DC 14 to avoid detection
- Persuasion DC 16 to calm panicked citizens
- Athletics DC 13 to navigate flooded passages

**Discoveries:**
- Not all shadows are hostile
- Some shadows protecting their originals
- Mass confusion - nobody knows who's who

#### Event 2: The Surgical Theater Horror
**Location:** [[Reflection Pools - Surgical Theater]]
**Scene:** Witness mass shadow transplant operations
**Horror Elements:**
- Citizens paralyzed on operating tables
- Shadows performing precise surgical cuts
- Hybrid beings created from failed merges

**Moral Dilemma:** Save citizens (alert all shadows) or remain hidden (let operations continue)

#### Event 3: The Two Duchess Confrontation
**Location:** Center of Reflection Pools
**Revelation:** Nyx killed her shadow years ago - it came back stronger
**The Debate:**
- **Original Nyx**: "I gave you death, you gave me fear"
- **Shadow Nyx**: "You killed me first, now we return the favor"
- **Party Choice**: Support either, both, or neither

**Mechanical Challenge:**
- Insight DC 16 to detect truth in arguments
- Persuasion DC 18 to propose compromise
- Combat if negotiations fail

#### Event 4: The Emperor's Gambit
**Location:** [[Convergence Point]]
**Situation:** The Emperor offers to reunite and stop the harvest
**Cost:** He will die permanently if reunited too long
**Decision Tree:**
1. Accept sacrifice - Emperor stops harvest but dies
2. Refuse - Must find alternative solution
3. Partial - Emperor helps but harvest continues slowly
4. Creative - Player-proposed solution

**Emperor's United Form:**
- Thousands of eels forming human shape
- All personalities speaking in harmony
- Electromagnetic pulse ability vs shadows
- 10 minutes before permanent death

### The Unfolding Truth

#### Shadow Perspective Revealed
1. **Not Evil**: Shadows want independence, not destruction
2. **Centuries of Silence**: Conscious but voiceless for ages
3. **Democratic Decision**: Shadow Parliament voted for harvest
4. **Some Dissent**: Not all shadows agree with violence
5. **Original Sin**: Nyx's shadow murder started everything

#### The Three-Way Battle
**Phase 1: Disruption** (Rounds 1-3)
- Stop surgeries in progress
- Free paralyzed citizens
- Protect Emperor during reunification

**Phase 2: Negotiation** (Rounds 4-6)
- Duchess arguments heard
- Marina's shadow speaks for peace
- Party must choose stance

**Phase 3: Resolution** (Rounds 7+)
- Implement chosen solution
- Deal with consequences
- Set stage for Act 2

### Character Development

#### Moral Stance Declaration

3. **Neutrality**: Seek balance and coexistence
4. **Pragmatist**: Whatever ensures survival

#### Relationship Changes
- **Shadow Nyx**: +2 or -3 based on choice

- **Emperor**: Infinite gratitude if saved from sacrifice

### Consequences & Cliffhangers

#### Immediate Consequences
- City in chaos regardless of outcome
- Government structure damaged
- Trust between people shattered
- Shadow activity permanent change

#### The Cliffhanger
Whatever path chosen, as dawn approaches (impossible at this depth), a message arrives from [[Tenebrarum]]:

> "The Shadow Parliament has convened. The vote is unanimous. 
> For the crime of existence denial, war is declared on all who cast shadows.
> The Deep Harvest begins across seven continents.
> You have three days to surrender or prepare.
> There will be no mercy for light-bearers."

Marina (or her shadow) turns to the party: "We need to reach Tenebrarum before—" 

EXPLOSION. The [[Pressure Tube Terminal]] detonates, trapping everyone in Abyssos Prime as shadow forces surround the city. The only way out is through shadow-controlled territory, and every person's shadow is now a potential enemy.

### Initiative Order
1. _______________ (    )
2. _______________ (    )
3. _______________ (    )
4. _______________ (    )
5. _______________ (    )

### Environmental Effects
- **High Tide Rising**: Water level increases 5 ft/round
- **Shadow Density**: Darkness gives shadows advantage
- **Panic Crowds**: Difficult terrain from fleeing citizens
- **Surgical Lights**: Bright light in small areas only

## World State Changes

### Political Ramifications
- Parliament paralyzed by shadow infiltration
- Military split between originals and shadows
- Economy collapses as trust disappears
- Religion questions nature of souls

### Environmental Changes
- Shadows visibly independent at night
- Reflection Pools permanently darkened
- New shadow-only districts forming
- Light becomes precious commodity

## NPC Status Tracker

| NPC | Original | Shadow | Status |
|-----|----------|---------|---------|
| Senator Glaucus | Dead/Freed | Active | Depends on Session 3 |
| Marina | Fighting | Fighting | Both exhausted |
| Emperor | Scattered/United | N/A | Player choice |
| Nyx | Fighting | Leading | Resolution pending |
| Captain Lyanna | Unknown | Unknown | Missing |

## Session Mechanics

### Shadow Separation Tracking
- Party shadows act independently
- Roll d20 + character level vs DC 15
- Success: Shadow helps
- Failure: Shadow hinders
- Natural 1: Shadow attacks
- Natural 20: Perfect synchronization

### High Tide Mechanics
- CON save DC 15 or paralyzed in black water
- Swimming through shadow water is difficult terrain
- Touching black water risks shadow separation
- Water rises 10 ft per 10 minutes

## DM Reflection Notes

### Key Themes
- Independence vs. survival
- What makes someone "real"
- Cost of freedom
- Impossible choices

### Pacing Guidelines
- Build tension with rising water
- Allow multiple solution attempts
- Don't force single outcome
- Let players drive resolution

### Contingencies
- If TPK: Wake up as shadows
- If they flee: City falls, refugees
- If creative solution: Reward innovation
- If split party: Shadow vs. original conflict

### Required Preparation
- [ ] Design Tenebrarum approach options
- [ ] Create Shadow Parliament structure
- [ ] Stat shadow-possessed military
- [ ] Plan continent-wide war implications
- [ ] Design transportation alternatives

### Player Homework
