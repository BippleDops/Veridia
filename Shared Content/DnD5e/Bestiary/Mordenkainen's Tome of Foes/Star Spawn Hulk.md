## Special Traits
***Psychic Mirror.*** If the hulk takes psychic damage, each creature within 10 feet of the hulk takes that damage instead; the hulk takes none of the damage. In addition, the hulk's thoughts and location can't be discerned by magic.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The hulk makes two slam attacks. If both attacks hit the same target, the target also takes 9 ( `dice: 2d8`) psychic damage and must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of the target's next turn.

***Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 ( `dice: 2d8+5`) bludgeoning damage.

***Reaping Arms (Recharge 5-6).*** The hulk makes a separate slam attack against each creature within 10 feet of it. Each creature that is hit must also succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

## Description
The hulk is the largest of the known star spawn. Though ogre-like in stature, the hulk's glistening translucent skin reveals a muscled form devoid of an ogre's fat. Pale and seemingly lidless eyes glare balefully from a face distorted by too many teeth and too little nose.

Hulks are seldom encountered without a commanding seer nearby. A hulk appears to have little will of its own, other than to protect its master.
