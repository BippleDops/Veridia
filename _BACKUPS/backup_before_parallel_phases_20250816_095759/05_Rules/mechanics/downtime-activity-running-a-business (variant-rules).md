--- # Downtime Activity: Running a Business

*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 129* Adventurers can end up owning businesses that have nothing to do with delving into dungeons or saving the world. A character might inherit a smithy, or the party might be given a parcel of farmland or a tavern as a reward. If they hold on to the business, they might feel obliged to spend time between adventures maintaining the venture and making sure it runs smoothly. A character rolls percentile dice and adds the number of days spent on this downtime activity (maximum 30), then compares the total to the Running a Business table to determine what happens. If the character is required to pay a cost as a result of rolling on this table but fails to do so, the business begins to fail. For each unpaid debt incurred in this manner, the character takes a -10 penalty to subsequent rolls made on this table. **Running a Business** | d100 + Days | Result |
|-------------|--------|
| 01-20 | You must pay one and a half times the business's maintece cost for each of the days. |
| 21-30 | You must pay the business's full maintece cost for each of the days. |
| 31-40 | You must pay half the business's maintece cost for each of the days. Profits cover the other half. |
| 41-60 | The business covers its own maintece cost for each of the days. |
| 61-80 | The business covers its own maintece cost for each of the days. It earns a profit of``dice: 1d6` Ã— 5`gp. |
| 81-90 | The business covers its own maintece cost for each of the days. It earns a profit of``dice: 2d8` Ã— 5`gp. |
| 91-100 | The business covers its own maintece cost for each of the days. It earns a profit of``dice: 3d10` Ã— 5`gp. |

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of downtime activity running a business as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around downtime activity running a business. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
