## Roc

*Avian of Unbelievable Size*

- **Habitat.** Arctic, Coastal, Desert, Hill, Mountain  
- **Treasure.** Any  

Birds of prey of fantastic scale, rocs hunt over vast territories and can snatch whole elephants, whales, or wagons in their talons. They then carry their prey back to their remote nests, journeys that can take days and cover hundreds of miles.

Rocs nest amid remote heights. Their nests are typically littered with treasure and uneaten prey. Roll on or choose an option from the Roc Nest Remts table to inspire what's in a roc's nest.

arctic, coastal, desert, hill, mountain

## Player-Facing Summary

## Lore Details

Legends speak of roc xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around roc xmm.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
