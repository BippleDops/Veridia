Suspended in the open water at 2,800 feet depth, the Bathyal Palace is a massive structure of crystallized water and compressed pearl that serves as the neutral meeting ground for all major factions of [[Aquabyssos World Overview|Aquabyssos]]. Built on the site where the last surface kingdoms signed their final treaty before [[The Great Drowning]], it remains magically neutral territory where violence is supposedly impossible. ### The Neutral Hall

A vast central chamber where faction representatives meet. The [[Bathyal Succession]] council convenes here, with each faction holding an equal voice. [[Mediator Serenity Stillwater]] facilitates negotiations with supernatural patience. ### The Embassy Ring

Circular arrangement of embassy suites, each maintained by different factions:
- [[Tethyan Hegemony]] suite (East)
- [[Coral Courts]] chambers (South)
- [[Depth Wardens]] quarters (North)
- [[Church of the Tidal Throne]] sanctuary (West)
- [[Free Current]] hidden rooms (location varies) ### The Archive of Accords

Library containing every treaty, agreement, and contract signed in the palace. Additionally, [[Keeper of Contracts Minerva Bindingword]] ensures all agreements are magically enforced. ### The Depth Gardens

Floating gardens of cultivated kelp and coral where private negotiations occur. [[Garden Keeper Zen Currentdancer]] maintains the delicate ecosystem and "accidentally" overhears many secrets. ### The Observation Sphere

Transparent sphere at the palace's peak offering 360-degree views. Used for divination and watching for approaching threats or visitors. ### The Peace Field

Magical barrier preventing all violence within the palace. Weapons become ethereal, and hostile magic simply fails. [[Enchanter Valdris Peacewarden]] maintains this ancient magic. ### The Speaking Pool

Scrying pool allowing communication with any location in Aquabyssos. Heavily monitored and restricted to official use. ### The Neutral Vault

Repository of disputed items held until ownership is resolved. Currently contains several artifacts including pieces of [[The Pressure Crown]]. ### The Treaty Stone

Original stone where the pre-drowning treaty was signed. Touching it while lying causes immediate expulsion from the palace. ### Ongoing Schemes

1. The succession crisis - who will lead when [[Mediator Stillwater]] retires
2. Secret alliance negotiations between unlikely factions
3. Assassination attempts disguised as accidents
4. Theft of treaty documents to void agreements
5. Infiltration by [[Deepmind Conspiracy]] agents ### The Diplomatic Suite


Luxury accommodations for visiting dignitaries. [[Concierge Phillip Gracewater]] attends to guests while gathering intelligence. ### The Neutral Table

Restaurant serving cuisine from all regions. [[Chef Amara Tastecurrent]] creates dishes that remind diners of the surface world. ### The Bathyal Bank

Ficial institution managing inter-faction trade. [[Banker Cornelius Goldflow]] knows everyone's debts and assets. ### The Message Service

Secure courier service between factions. [[Courier Chief Swift Currentrider]] guarantees delivery and discretion. ## Current Events

1. Emergency session called regarding [[The Deep Uprising]]
2. Duke Reefheart accused of biological warfare
3. Missing diplomat from [[New Tethys|02 Worldbuilding/Places/New Tethys]]
4. Proposal to admit [[The Trencher Folk]] as a faction
5. Peace Field flickering in certain areas ## Secrets



> [!warning] DM Only
> - The Peace Field is powered by a trapped angel of peace
> - Mediator Stillwater is immortal, cursed to maintain neutrality forever
> - The Treaty Stone contains the true cause of the Great Drowning
> - Several ambassadors are already controlled by the Deepmind
> - The palace itself is slowly sinking toward the Hadal Depths ## Random Encounters (d10)

1. Heated diplomatic argument testing Peace Field limits
2. Courier with urgent sealed message
3. Spy attempting to access restricted areas
4. Ambassador offering alliance to party
5. Servant "accidentally" dropping important documents
6. Emergency council session being called
7. Faction representatives in secret meeting
8. Assassination attempt failing due to Peace Field
9. Rare surface delicacy being served
10. Peace Field temporarily failing in small area ## Player-Facing Summary The Bathyal Palace is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Bathyal Palace as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around The Bathyal Palace. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is searching for a artifact for money
