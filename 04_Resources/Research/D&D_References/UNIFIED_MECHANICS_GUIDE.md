- Old **DC 10**-12 = New **DC 10** (Easy)
- Old **DC 13**-15 = New **DC 13** (Moderate) - Old **DC 16**-18 = New **DC 16** (Hard)
- Old **DC 19**-21 = New **DC 20** (Very Hard)
- Old **DC 22**+ = New **DC 25** (Legendary) ## Integration Guidelines 1. **Always use this guide first** for any mechanical question

2. Refer to specific system files only for detailed procedures
3. Apply environmental modifiers consistently
4. Scale challenges to character level and adaptation
5. Remember that progression is about choice, not just power --- *This unified system ensures consistent, balanced gameplay while preserving the unique horror and wonder of both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. When in doubt, favor player agency and narrative consistency over mechanical complexity.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*

- Can be adapted to fit current story needs
- Scalable threat/reward based on party level
- Multiple entry points for different play styles
- Connections to overarching campaign themes ## Plot Hooks - Someone is hunting a witness for money
