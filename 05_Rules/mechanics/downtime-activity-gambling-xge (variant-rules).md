--- # Downtime Activity: Gambling

*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 130* Games of chance are a way to make a fortuneâ€”and perhaps a better way to lose one. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Resources This activity requires one workweek of effort plus a stake of at least 10 gp, to a maximum of 1,000 gp or more, as you see fit. ## Resolution The character must make a series of checks, with a DC determined at random based on the quality of the competition that the character runs into. Part of the risk of gambling is that one never knows who might end up sitting across the table. The character makes three checks: Wisdom ([[skills#Insight|Insight]]), Charisma ([[skills#Deception|Deception]]), and Charisma ([[skills#Intimidation|Intimidation]]). If the character has proficiency with an appropriate [[gaming-set-xphb (items)]], that tool proficiency can replace the relevant skill in any of the checks. The DC for each of the checks is`5 + 2d10`; generate a separate DC for each one. Consult the Gambling Results table to see how the character did. ## Complications Gambling tends to attract unsavory individuals. The potential complications involved come from run-ins with the law and associations with various criminals tied to the activity. Every workweek spent gambling brings a 10 percent chance of a complication, examples of which are on the Gambling Complications table. ## Player-Facing Summary Downtime activity gambling xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
