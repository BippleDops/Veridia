## Overview
Willowbark has been the guardian of the Heart Tree in [[The Verdant Reach for over three centuries, though few realize the tree itself contains the [The Seven Shards]]. Born from the union of a human druid and a dryad, she has slowly merged with both the tree and the Shard over the centuries, becoming something between mortal, nature spirit, and divine artifact. She speaks for the natural world and maintains the delicate balance that keeps the Emerald Shard from overwhelming the region with unchecked growth.

## Adventure Hooks

2. **The Sacred Grove**: Protect ancient tree from developers or cultists
3. **The Nature's Plea**: Speak for forest in negotiations with expanding city
4. **The Shard's Whisper**: Seek her knowledge about other Shard locations

### Special Abilities

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Willowbark fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Emerald Shard Fusion.** Willowbark has been bonded with the [The Seven Shards]] for three centuries. The Shard is embedded in the Heart Tree's core and channels its power through her. She cannot be separated from the tree without destroying both.

**Heart Tree Network.** Willowbark's consciousness extends through the entire root network of [[The Verdant Reach. She can manifest at any point within this network and knows everything that occurs within it.

**Living Forest.** The forest itself serves as Willowbark's extended body. All plants within 10 miles are under her control, and she can see through the senses of any creature living within [The Verdant Reach]].

**Shard Resoce.** Willowbark can sense the location and emotional state of other Shard bearers across any distance. She feels their pain, joy, and internal conflicts.

**Nature's Avatar.** Willowbark regenerates 20 hit points at the start of her turn while in natural surroundings. This regeneration is suppressed if she takes fire damage.

**Immortal Guardian.** Willowbark cannot die of old age and has lived for 347 years. If reduced to 0 hit points, she begins to reform in the Heart Tree after 24 hours unless the tree is destroyed.

**Spellcasting.** Willowbark is a 20th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save **DC 22**, +14 to hit with spell attacks). She knows the following spells:

- **Cantrips (at will):** druidcraft, guidance, mending, thorn whip, poison spray, shape water
- **1st level (4 slots):** cure wounds, detect magic, entangle, faerie fire, goodberry, speak with animals
- **2nd level (3 slots):** animal messenger, barkskin, heat metal, lesser restoration, moonbeam
- **3rd level (3 slots):** call lightning, conjure animals, plant growth, speak with plants, wind wall
- **4th level (3 slots):** confusion, conjure woodland beings, giant insect, ice storm, wall of fire
- **5th level (3 slots):** awaken, commune with nature, insect plague, scrying, tree stride
- **6th level (1 slot):** heal, move earth, sunbeam, transport via plants, wall of thorns
- **7th level (1 slot):** plane shift, regenerate, reverse gravity
- **8th level (1 slot):** animal shapes, earthquake, feeblemind
- **9th level (1 slot):** foresight, shapechange, storm of vengeance

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Willowbark makes three attacks: two with Heartwood Staff and one Forest's Wrath, or casts a spell and makes two attacks.

**Heartwood Staff (+3 Quarterstaff).** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (`dice: `dice: 1d6`` + 7) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (`dice: `dice: 2d8``) force damage. The staff can extend up to 30 feet as a bonus action and functions as an immovable rod when planted.

**Forest's Wrath.** Willowbark commands plants within 120 feet to attack. Up to 6 creatures must make a **DC 22** Dexterity saving throw as roots, vines, and branches strike them. On a failure, they take 18 (`dice: `dice: 4d8``) piercing damage and are restrained until the end of their next turn.

**Emerald Burst (3/Day).** The Shard's power erupts in a 60-foot radius. All creatures in the area must make a **DC 22** Constitution saving throw. Enemies take 36 (`dice: `dice: 8d8``) radiant damage on a failure (half on success) and have their speed reduced by half for 1 minute. Allies regain 36 hit points and gain advantage on their next ability check or saving throw.

**Nature's Rebuke (1/Day).** Willowbark calls upon the collective anger of the natural world. All creatures within 300 feet that have harmed nature in the past year must make a **DC 22** Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they take 54 (`dice: `dice: 12d8``) psychic damage and are frightened for 1 minute. On a success, they take half damage and are not frightened.

**Heart Tree's Blessing (1/Day).** Willowbark channels the Emerald Shard through the Heart Tree. Choose one effect:
- **Mass Regeneration**: All allies within 1 mile regain all hit points and are cured of all conditions
- **Forest Awakening**: All plants within 5 miles become sentient allies for 24 hours
- **Natural Sanctuary**: [[The Verdant Reach becomes impassable to enemies for 1 week
- **Shard Communication**: Contact any other Shard bearer regardless of distance or plane

**Lifesteal Vines (Recharge 5-6).** Willowbark summons 12 magical vines in a 60-foot radius. Each vine attacks the nearest enemy (+12 to hit, 12 piercing damage). When a vine hits, Willowbark regains 12 hit points. Vines last for 3 rounds.

### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)
Willowbark can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.

**Move.** Willowbark moves up to her speed or teleports to any point within [The Verdant Reach]].

**Forest Command.** Willowbark uses Forest's Wrath or commands plants to create difficult terrain in a 30-foot radius.

**Nature's Touch.** Willowbark touches a creature within 5 feet. Allies regain 15 hit points, enemies must make a **DC 22** Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute.

**Emerald Sight (Costs 2 Actions).** Willowbark scrys on any location within 100 miles through plant life, or casts a spell of 5th level or lower.

**Avatar Manifestation (Costs 3 Actions).** Willowbark creates a duplicate of herself at any point within [[The Verdant Reach. The duplicate has half her hit points and can act independently.

### Lair Actions
When encountered within [The Verdant Reach]], Willowbark can take lair actions on initiative count 20:

**Living Forest.** All plant life within 1 mile attacks enemies. Each hostile creature must succeed on a **DC 20** Dexterity saving throw or take 18 (`dice: `dice: 4d8``) piercing damage and be restrained.

**Heart Tree Pulse.** The Emerald Shard sends a wave of life energy through the forest. All allies within 5 miles regain 20 hit points, while enemies must succeed on a **DC 20** Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 round.

**Nature's Maze.** The forest rearranges itself. Willowbark can move any number of trees, rocks, or other natural features to create walls, difficult terrain, or clear passages.

**Elemental Guardians.** Willowbark summons `dice: `dice: 1d4`` treants or `dice: `dice: 2d4`` dryads to fight alongside her. They disappear after 1 hour or when the combat ends.

### Three Centuries of Fusion
Willowbark's extended bond with the [[The Seven Shards has created unique abilities:

### The Heart Tree - Living Shard Vessel
The ancient oak containing the Emerald Shard has itself become semi-sentient:
- **Trunk Diameter**: 50 feet, with the Shard visible as a green glow in the heartwood
- **Root Network**: Extends throughout [The Verdant Reach]], covering 10,000 square miles
- **Height**: 400 feet tall, with branches that can reach across vast distances
- **Consciousness**: Developing its own personality separate from Willowbark
- **Defense Systems**: Can animate its roots and branches as weapons when threatened

---

#### The Growth Paradox
*"What grows without limit becomes a cancer. What refuses to grow becomes stone. The wise gardener knows when to prune, when to nurture, and when to let the old growth die so new life can flourish. So too with power - even divine power."*

#### The Shard Symphony
*"Seven voices sang the world into being, and seven voices shall sing its ending or renewal. The Song of Growth cannot be sung alone - it needs the harmony of Shadow's rest, Crystal's structure, Gold's purity, Amber's endurance, Azure's flow, and Crimson's passion. Discord brings destruction; harmony brings transformation."*

#### The Root Revelation
*"Beneath all kingdoms, all conflicts, all grand designs, the roots spread in darkness, connecting every growing thing. Kings may rule the surface, but life itself flows through channels they cannot see. The child of gold understands this - power shared is power multiplied."*

#### The Convergence Garden
*"When the seven lights converge, reality itself becomes a garden that can be planted with any seed. Beware - for a garden of nightmares grows as readily as a garden of dreams. The gardener's heart determines what blooms."*

### Current Visions & Insights
Her centuries of experience and Shard connection grant profound insights:

### Prices in Service
Willowbark often requests service rather than gold:
- Plant rare seeds from distant lands in her forest
- Protect endangered species for specified periods
- Stop industrial operations threatening natural areas
- Bring news of environmental threats or natural wonders
- Spend time learning from nature rather than exploiting it

---

### The Growing Power Dilemma
As the Convergence approaches, the Emerald Shard grows stronger:
- **Uncontrolled Growth**: Risk of [[The Verdant Reach expanding to cover the continent
- **Loss of Humanity**: Centuries of tree-bonding make her less able to understand mortal concerns
- **Forced Evolution**: All life in her domain may be "improved" whether it wants to be or not
- **The Tree's Voice**: The Heart Tree developing independent will that may conflict with hers

#### The Sacrifice Path
Willowbark realizes the Emerald Shard must be contained and chooses to:
- Merge completely with the Heart Tree, becoming immobile but preventing overgrowth
- Transfer her consciousness to [Archdruid Thornweaver]] and let her body become part of the forest
- Use her life force to create a permanent barrier around the Shard
- Split her soul among all living things in [[The Verdant Reach, achieving true immortality through dispersal

#### The Evolution Path
Willowbark embraces the Shard's growing power and becomes:
- Avatar of natural divinity, transforming [Aethermoor]] into a living ecosystem
- Guardian-goddess of a new age where nature and civilization achieve perfect balance
- The heart of a continental consciousness that thinks in geological time
- Bridge between mortal and divine perspectives on environmental stewardship

#### The Teaching Path
Willowbark focuses on preparing others and chooses to:
- Train multiple successors so her knowledge isn't lost when she ascends or dies
- Create a living library where future generations can access her memories
- Establish protocols for managing Shard power that don't require personal sacrifice
- Develop sustainable ways to channel divine power through natural systems
