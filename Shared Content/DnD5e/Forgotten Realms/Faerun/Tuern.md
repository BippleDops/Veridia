# Tuern
## Overview
The merciless Northfolk ofTuern (see map 3.13) pay tribute to three adult red dragons that live inside and beneath the island's active volcanoes-a chain of black, grumbling, lava-filled cauldrons that belch smoke and ash into the sky. Five Northfolk tribes live on the island, each with its own settlement, king, and fleet of dragon-headed longships. Four of the kings recognize the fifth, High King Ossul Haarn of [[Uttersea]] (CE male Illuskan human gladiator with 90 hit points and a ring of fire resistance), as their liege. [[Uttersea]] is the largest [[G6 - Town|town]] on the island and has a port for the High King's armada of longships. The island is also home to small families of fire giants who strive to unseat the island's draconic overlords and enslave the Northfolk.
