# Familiars
*Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 213* 

Any spellcaster that can cast the [[find-familiar-xphb|find familiar]] spell (such as an apprentice, warlock, or wizard) is likely to have a familiar. The familiar can be one of the creatures described in the spell (see the "Player's Handbook") or some other Tiny monster, such as a [[cranium-rat-mpmm|cranium rat]], a [[crawling-claw-xmm|crawling claw]], a [[gazer-mpmm|gazer]], an [[imp-xmm|imp]], a [[pseudodragon-xmm|pseudodragon]], or a [[quasit-xmm|quasit]].
