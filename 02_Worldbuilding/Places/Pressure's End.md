## Overview

Carved into a massive underwater cliff face at 3,500 feet depth, Pressure's End is the military heart of [[Aquabyssos World Overview]]. This fortress-city serves as headquarters for the [[Depth Wardens]] and stands as the last major defense against the horrors rising from [[The Hadal Depths]]. Built from reinforced stone and pearlsteel, it's the only city that has never fallen to deep-sea invasion.

### The Garrison Deeps

Military quarter housing the [[Depth Wardens]]' barracks, training grounds, and armories. [[12_Research/D&D_Statblocks/Admiral Thorne Blackwater]] commands from the Strategic Depth Chamber, a room where pressure can be adjusted to simulate any depth.

### The Forge Trenches

Industrial district where [[12_Research/D&D_Statblocks/Master Smith Vulcan Deepforge]] oversees the creation of pressure-resistant weapons and armor. The forges burn with eternal flame preserved from before [[12_Research/D&D_Statblocks/The Great Drowning]].

### Civilian Shelf

Terraced residential area for non-military citizens. [[Quartermaster Judith Steadfast]] manages supplies and ensures military families are provided for.

### The Lock

High-security prison carved deeper into the cliff, where dangerous criminals and deep-creatures are held. [[Warden Marcus Stonehand]] maintains order through brutal efficiency.

### The Watchtower Depths

Observation posts extending into the darkness below, staffed by scouts and diviners watching for threats from the deep.

### The War College

Training academy for elite Depth Wardens. [[Commander Drake Pressureborn]] instructs in deep combat techniques and psychological resistance to [[12_Research/D&D_Statblocks/The Deepmind]].

### The Depth Chapel

Fortified temple where [[Battle Priest Cassius Depthshield]] blesses weapons and soldiers before deep patrols. Dedicated to gods of war and protection.

### The Pressure Chamber

Medical and experimental facility where [[Doctor Helena Voidwalker]] studies the effects of extreme depth on body and mind. Also used for interrogation.

### The Strategic Archive

Military intelligence center containing maps of the deep trenches and records of every deep incursion. [[Spymaster Crow]] coordinates intelligence operations from here.

### The Titan Dock

Massive bay housing the city's war-leviathans, giant creatures trained for deep combat. [[Beast Master Krell Chainbreaker]] maintains these living weapons.

### The Drowned Soldier Tavern

Veterans' gathering place run by [[Retired Captain Bron Saltbeard]]. Information about deep threats traded freely here.

### Irondeep Supplies

[[12_Research/D&D_Statblocks/Merchant Viktor Geargrind]] sells military-grade equipment to authorized buyers. Secretly supplies resistance groups opposing military rule.

### The Pressure Seal

Inn catering to deep scouts and travelers, run by [[Innkeeper Mara Ironlung]]. Each room can be pressurized to match any depth.

### Deepguard Provisions

[[Supplier Erikson Tidecaller]] provides specialized equipment for deep expeditions, including pressure suits and emergency ascent magic.
