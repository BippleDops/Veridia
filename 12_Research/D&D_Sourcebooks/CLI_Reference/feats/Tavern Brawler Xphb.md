--- # Tavern Brawler

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 202* You gain the following benefits. **Enhanced Unarmed Strike.** When you hit with your Unarmed Strike and deal damage, you can deal Bludgeoning damage equal to`d4`plus your Strength modifier instead of the normal damage of an Unarmed Strike. **Damage Rerolls.** Whenever you roll a damage die for your Unarmed Strike, you can reroll the die if it rolls a 1, and you must use the new roll. **Improvised Weaponry.** You have proficiency with improvised weapons. **Push.** When you hit a creature with an Unarmed Strike as part of the [[actions#Attack|Attack]] action on your turn, you can deal damage to the target and also push it 5 feet away from you. You can use this benefit only once per turn. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Tavern brawler xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
