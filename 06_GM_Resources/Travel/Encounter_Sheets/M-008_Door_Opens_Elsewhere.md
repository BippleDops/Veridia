# M-008 Door Opens Elsewhere

## Read-Aloud
> The maintenance door sighs open—not into the crawlspace, but onto a wind-stung cliff under twin moons.

## Setup
- Type: Anchored • Category: Navigation/Exploration

## Mechanics
- Anchorite DC 15 to close; Sanity DC 14; optional exploration skill checks

## Outcomes
- Success: Close safely; small treasure 50–150 gp
- Partial: Creature incursion (appropriate to destination)
- Fail: Door sticks open; encounter escalates

## Integrations
- Cross-world; anchors; sanity

## Quick-Run
- Decide explore vs. close; call DCs; run incursion on failure
