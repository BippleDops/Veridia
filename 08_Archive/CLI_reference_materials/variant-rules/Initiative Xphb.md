# Initiative
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 369. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. The combat rules in "chapter 1" explain how to roll Initiative.

Sometimes a DM might have combatants use their Initiative scores instead of rolling Initiative. Your Initiative score equals 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If you have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on Initiative rolls, increase your Initiative score by 5. If you have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on those rolls, decrease that score by 5.

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
