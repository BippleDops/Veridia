- **Components:** V, S

For the duration, your eyes become an inky void. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects of your choice for the duration.

On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to target another creature but can't target a creature again if it has succeeded on a save against this casting of the spell.
