# Scribes' Desk
## Overview
Everyone wants to make history, but few are willing to write it. Aurora’s Catalogue therefore hails the downtrodden and ill-used class of scribes, and provides them the equipment they need to set history to paper. We use only the finest quality paper from timber felled in the High Forest, and all of our books are bound in Waterdeep under the strict supervision of the Scriveners, Scribes, and Clerk’s Guild. Our products receive no greater recommendation than our yearly mass order from a representative of the Candlekeep sages.
