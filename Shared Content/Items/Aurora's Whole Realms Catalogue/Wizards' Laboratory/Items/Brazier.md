## Description
Though not as controllable as ovens, braziers supply quick or long-term heat to [[Beakers|vials]] and [[Beakers|beakers]] without removing them from sight. Our small bronze brazier (5 gp) holds enough coals to heat a large beaker, whereas our large brazier can heat an entire laboratory. Our burners (5 sp) are circular slabs of hard wax in which linen rags are coiled to act as wicks. These slabs fit easily into our small braziers and provide constant, low-level heat.

## Additional Details
3 small braziers and 9 burners are requisite for a complete laboratory
