```encounter
name: Encounter
creatures:
 - 1: Gnarlwood
```



*This creature resembles a treant, but instead of the kindly, gentle face of the tree-folk, its face is twisted into a grim scowl. Its deep-set eyes and jagged mouth give it an almost skull-like grimace, and its four twisted arms are tipped with sharp, woody claws. Its leaves are deep green, almost black, and have ghostly white markings on them. Behind it, the skeletal remains of its unfortunate victims shamble through the undergrowth.*

## Special Traits
**Protected from Good:** Good-aligned creatures have tactical disadvantage when attacking a gnarlwood, and it can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by a good-aligned creature.

**Rend:** If a single target is hit by two of the gnarlwood's clawed branch attacks in a single turn, that target automatically takes an additional 15 (`dice: 2d8+6`) slashing damage and is grappled.

**Spell-like Abilities:** The gnarlwood can use the following spell-like abilities, using Wisdom as its casting ability (DC 12, attack +4). The gnarlwood doesn’t need material components to use these abilities.

- At Will: *ray of sickness*

- 3/day: *animate dead, blight, inflict wounds*

- 1/day: *circle of power, dispel evil and good 1/week: circle of death*

**Unhallowed Aura:** When an undead creature within 30 feet of a gnarlwood attacks or makes a saving throw, it can roll `dice: 1d4` along with its `dice: d20` and add the results together.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A gnarlwood attacks four times with clawed branches, or it uses a spell-like ability.

**Clawed Branch:** *Melee Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (`dice: 2d8+6`) slashing damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate forests

**Organization**: Solitary or band (2–4 plus `dice: 1d6` skeletons or zombies per gnarlwood)

## Description
Gnarlwoods grow from the seeds of treants that had the misfortune of sprouting in cursed ground. The good nature of the treant is subverted by the evil nourishment it gains from the earth, and the evil suffuses into its every fiber.

Most gnarlwoods die before they are much larger than twiggy saplings, since few creatures of nature can survive on a diet of pure evil. Those that do survive grow into menacing, twisted mockeries of treants, with four knobby arms that end in cruel barbed claws. Gnarlwoods are spiteful, hateful beings that seek to destroy everything they see. Bereft of any compassion, they tear through forests accompanied by the shambling corpses of their victims, rending and clawing whatever they meet.

Some evil druidic temples secluded deep in ancient forests are protected by entire groves of gnarlwoods. Unfortunately for the worshippers, eventually not even they are spared the psychotic wrath of the gnarlwood. A gnarlwood usually begins combat by sending its undead minions into battle ahead of itself, to distract or soften up its foes. It uses its spell-like abilities against targets it deems most hateful—clerics and paladins are high priority, followed by other spellcasters. During battle, it tries to keep its undead minions within range of its undead blessing aura.

A gnarlwood constantly howls and wails in its uncanny, hollow voice during battle, and always fights to the death.
