## Description
An adult rhinoceros beetle is about 10 feet long. These creatures are found in the warm jungles and forests of the world, where they spend their days searching for plants, fruits, berries, and other creatures—some of which are ferocious predators themselves—on which to sustain themselves. They also scavenge the carcasses of dead animals, wading into the carrion as they shred the remains with their mandibles. In the process, the beetle inevitably becomes smeared with blood and gets chunks of carrion caught in its carapace. Consequently, giant rhinoceros beetles are accompanied everywhere by clouds of flies, gnats, and other tiny, buzzing, stinging vermin that make them very unpleasant to stand near.

A giant rhinoceros beetle charges heedlessly into melee, slashing with its horn whenever it can charge up to an opponent and biting with its razor sharp mandibles if it has a target already adjacent.
