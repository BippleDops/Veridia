# Cap of Water Breathing
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  



While wearing this cap underwater, you can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action to create a bubble of air around your head. This bubble allows you to breathe normally underwater. This bubble stays with you until the cap is removed or you are no longer underwater.
