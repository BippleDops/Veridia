## Description
I was in a castle where orcs jumped up on the casements and raged at us. I thought how to stop orcs from climbing the casements. I made this machine to sweep the casements with steel blades. They climb atop the casement and lose their legs and fall back on the others. I can build one for you. 300 gp.
