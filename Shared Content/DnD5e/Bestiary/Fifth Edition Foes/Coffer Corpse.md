## Special Traits
**Death Grip:** A creature that is grappled by a coffer corpse can't speak or cast spells that have verbal components.

**Deceiving Death:** The first time a coffer corpse's hit points are reduced below 20, the creature collapses to the ground as if slain. A grappled creature is released. To all inspection, the coffer corpse appears destroyed. At the start of its next turn, the coffer corpse regains `dice: 3d6` hit points and rises again as if reanimated. Every creature that sees the coffer corpse rise must make a successful DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for `dice: 2d4` rounds or until they see the coffer corpse destroyed.

**Magic Weapon:** A coffer corpse's claws are treated as an attack from a magic weapon.

## Actions
**Claws:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d8+3`) magic, slashing damage and the target is grappled.

**Stragulation:** *Melee Attack:* automatic hit, one creature already grappled by the coffer corpse at the start of the coffer corpse's turn. Hit: the target must make a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw or it runs out of breath and begins suffocating. If the strangled creature escapes from the coffer corpse's grapple, suffocation ends immediately but the creature is incapacitated until the end of its next turn.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any land, subterranean

**Organization**: Solitary or crypt (2–12)

## Description
The coffer corpse is an undead creature formed as the result of an incomplete death ritual. It is often found haunting stranded funeral barges or in situations where a corpse has not been delivered to its final resting place. Because of the manner of their creation, most coffer corpses are sealed inside coffins or sarcophagi until they are released by unwitting tomb robbers. Coffer corpses hate life and attack most living creatures on sight.

At a distance, a coffer corpse is often mistaken for a zombie. They are quicker, however, and display a level of anger and hatred that indicate they are more than mindless automatons.

In combat, a coffer corpse attacks with its filthy, ragged fingernails. They always try to grab a victim by the throat and strangle it to death. Once a coffer corpse gets its hands around a victim’s throat, it doesn’t let go until the victim is dead, or the coffer corpse is either destroyed, or damaged enough to trigger its deceiving death.
