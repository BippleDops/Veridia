## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing a lich's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **All-Seeing.** While in its lair, the lich can cast [[clairvoyance xphb|Clairvoyance]], requiring no spell components and using the same spellcasting ability as its Spellcasting action.  
- **Inevitable Siphon.** Whenever a Humanoid dies within 1 mile of the lair, its soul is immediately consumed by the lich. A Humanoid whose soul is consumed in this way can be brought back to life only by a True Resurrection or [[wish xphb|Wish]] spell.  

If the lich is destroyed or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. These effects resume if the lich gains a new body (see its Spirit Jar trait).

## Player-Facing Summary

Lich xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of lich xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around lich xmm.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
