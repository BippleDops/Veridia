--- # Slow

*3rd-level, Transmutation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of molasses)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot [[Cube Area of Effect Xphb within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration. An affected target's [Fly Speed Xphb]] is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't take Reactions. On its turns, it can take either an action or a [[Action Xphb, not both, and it can make only one attack if it takes the [actions#Attack|Attack]] action. If it casts a spell with a Somatic component, there is a chance the spell fails as a result of the target making the spell's gestures too slowly. An affected target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on itself on a success. **Classes**: [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 318. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Slow xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of slow xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around slow xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Strange sightings suggest a portal
