## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting.*** The mezzoloth's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 11). The mezzoloth can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
2/day each: *darkness, dispel magic*
1/day: *cloudkill*

***Magic Resistance.*** The mezzoloth has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The mezzoloth's weapon attacks are magical.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The mezzoloth makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its trident.

***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (`dice: 2d4+4`) slashing damage.

***Trident.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d6+4`) piercing damage, or 8 (`dice: 1d8+4`) piercing damage when held with two claws and used to make a melee attack.

***Teleport.*** The mezzoloth magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

***Variant: Summon Yugoloth (1/Day).*** The yugoloth attempts a magical summoning.

A summoned yugoloth appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, does as it pleases, and can't summon other yugoloths. The summoned yugoloth remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner takes a bonus action to dismiss it.

## Description
The bulk of the yugoloth population is made up of mezzoloths, which are human-sized insect creatures covered in dense chitinous plates. Mezzoloths serve as foot soldiers in yugoloth armies, their wide-set eyes glowing red as the mezzoloths bear down on their foes.

Violence and reward are the fundamental drives of a mezzoloth, and powerful beings that promise one or the other can easily attract them into service. Although it has lethal claws on its four arms, a mezzoloth typically wields a trident in two of them. If surrounded by enemies, a mezzoloth exhales toxic fumes that can choke and kill whole groups of creatures.
