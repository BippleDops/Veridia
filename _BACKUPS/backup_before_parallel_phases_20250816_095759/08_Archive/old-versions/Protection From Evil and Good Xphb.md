--- # Protection from Evil and Good

*1st-level, Abjuration* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a flask of Holy Water worth 25+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against creatures that are Aberrations, Celestials, Elementals, Fey, Fiends, or Undead. The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have [[Advantage Xphb on attack rolls against the target. The target also can't be possessed by or gain the [conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] or [[conditions#frightened|Frightened conditions from them. If the target is already possessed, [conditions#Charmed|Charmed]], or [[conditions#frightened|Frightened by such a creature, the target has [Advantage Xphb]] on any new saving throw against the relevant effect. **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 309.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of protection from evil and good xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around protection from evil and good xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Related Notes - [Similar Topic 1]]
