# Incendiary Cloud
*8th-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A swirling cloud of embers and smoke fills a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on a point within range. The cloud's area is [Heavily Obscured](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/heavily-obscured-xphb.md). It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (like that created by [Gust of Wind](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/gust-of-wind-xphb.md)) disperses it.

When the cloud appears, each creature in it makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `10d8` Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this save when the [Sphere](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) moves into its space and when it enters the [Sphere](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

The cloud moves 10 feet away from you in a direction you choose at the start of each of your turns.

**Classes**: [Druid](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Sorcerer](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Wizard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
