  "revised_prompt": "Generate a collection of painterly styled images that are evocative of high fantasy and medieval times. The focus should be on a detailed artifact, specifically armor-of-poison-resistance. The material choices should veer towards pressure-forged metals, pearl, coral, and cloud-crystal, with abstract sigils that emit a gentle glow instead of recognizable letters. Add a human hand or a ruler for scale. The armor should radiate an aquatic fantasy realism, with signs of subsurface caustics and bioluminescent accents. The color palette leans towards hues of deep teals, blues, sea-greens, with tasteful pearl highlights. Ensure that while detail is paramount, the image avoids the pitfalls of sci-fi UIs, modern signage, photorealism, anime styles, and bloom glare.",
