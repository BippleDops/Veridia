The Shadow Surgeon represents the most dangerous and morally complex character option in the [[Shadow Conspiracy. These rogues have mastered the art of consciousness manipulation, identity theft, and surgical precision in both healing and harm. They operate in the shadows of [Aquabyssos]] society, capable of becoming anyone while serving mysterious masters who seek to control the realm through infiltration and psychological warfare. ## Core Concept

Shadow Surgeons are specialized rogues who combine traditional stealth and infiltration skills with terrifying abilities to alter memories, steal identities, and perform surgical procedures that blur the line between healing and harm. They represent the medical wing of the [[Shadow Conspiracy, using their knowledge of anatomy and consciousness to serve their hidden agenda. ### Rogue Archetype: Shadow Surgery

At 3rd level, Shadow Surgeon Rogues gain access to the Shadow Surgery archetype: ### Feature: Shadow Network

You have contacts throughout the Shadow Conspiracy who can provide information, safe houses, and specialized equipment. However, using these contacts may draw unwanted attention from conspiracy enemies or require performing tasks for the organization. ### Moral Complexity

Shadow Surgeons present unique ethical dilemmas:
- Can good ends justify consciousness manipulation?
- Is identity theft murder if the original personality is preserved?
- How much of yourself remains after extensive surgical modification?
- What happens when shadow surgery is used for genuinely beneficial purposes? ### Campaign Warnings

This character build involves themes of:
- Identity theft and consciousness manipulation
- Medical procedures used for harm
- Psychological horror and loss of self
- Infiltration and betrayal of trust DMs should discuss these themes with players before allowing Shadow Surgeon characters. ### Rogue/Warlock (Great Old One)

Gain telepathic abilities and mind manipulation powers from eldritch patrons. Nevertheless, ### Rogue/Wizard (Enchantment)

Enhance memory and consciousness manipulation with arcane theory. ### Rogue/Bard (Whispers)

Perfect infiltration through performance and social manipulation. ### Rogue/Cleric (Trickery)

Divine magic enhances deception and provides moral complexity. ## Ethical Considerations

The Shadow Surgeon represents one of the most morally ambiguous character options in the setting. Players should work with their DM to explore themes of identity, consciousness, and the ethics of mental manipulation while maintaining party cohesion and campaign tone. This build is designed for mature players interested in exploring complex moral questions within a fantasy framework. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*
