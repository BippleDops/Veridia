# Layers of Pandemonium
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 206* 

**Layers of Pandemonium**

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Pandesmos | Howling winds, dark streams bound for the River Styx, and blowing snow pour through vast, desolate caverns. |
| Cocytus | Winds blowing through narrower tunnels create a stronger force and louder wails, making this the so-called "Layer of Lamentation." |
| Phlegethon | Tunnel walls absorb light while water creates intricate rock formations. |
| Agathion | Sealed-off tunnels are largely inaccessible from elsewhere, making them ideal as vaults for ancient secrets. |
