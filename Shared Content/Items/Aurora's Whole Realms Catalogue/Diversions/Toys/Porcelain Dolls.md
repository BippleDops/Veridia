## Description
Made in Tilverton and Urmlaspyr, these baby dolls are made of fine china and decked out in rich swaddling clothes. While not suitable for life on the trail, they are perfect for the children of retired adventurers who have a long winter’s rest ahead of them. Due to complaints on quality, Aurora’s no longer carries Westgate porcelain or dolls. Only human dolls available, at 2 gp each.
