## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting.*** The eladrin's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At Will: *charm person, Tasha's hideous laughter*
3/day each: *confusion, enthrall, suggestion*
1/day each: *hallucinatory terrain, Otto's irresistible dance*

***Fey Step (Recharge 4-6).*** As a bonus action, the eladrin can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

***Joyful Presence.*** Any non-eladrin creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the eladrin must make a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is charmed for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature becomes immune to any eladrin's Joyful Presence for 24 hours.
Whenever the eladrin deals damage to the charmed creature, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Magic Resistance.*** The eladrin has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The eladrin makes two weapon attacks. The eladrin can cast one spell in place of one of these attacks.

***Longsword.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ( `dice: 1d8+2`) slashing damage plus 4 ( `dice: 1d8`) psychic damage, or 7 ( `dice: 1d10+2`) slashing damage plus 4 ( `dice: 1d8`) psychic damage if used with two hands.

***Longbow.** Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ( `dice: 1d8+3`) piercing damage plus 4 ( `dice: 1d8`) psychic damage.

## Description
Their hearts filled with joy, spring eladrin cavort through their sylvan realms, their songs and laughter filling the air. These playful eladrin beguile other creatures to fill them with the joy of spring. Their antics can lead other creatures into danger and make mischief for them.
