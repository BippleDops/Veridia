## Description
Souls of evil creatures that descend to the Lower Planes are transformed into manes-the lowest form of demonkind. These wretched fiends attack any non-demon they see, and they are called to the Material Plane by those seeking to sow death and chaos.

Orcus, the Prince of Undeath, has the power to transform manes into undead monsters, most often [[Ghoul|ghouls]] and [[Shadow|shadows]]. Other demon lords feed on manes, destroying them utterly. Otherwise, killing a manes causes it to dissipate into a cloud of reeking vapor that reforms into another manes after one day.
