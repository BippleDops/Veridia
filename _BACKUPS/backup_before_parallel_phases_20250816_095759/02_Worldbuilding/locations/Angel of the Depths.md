## Overview

The Angel of the Depths is a colossal stone statue that rises from the abyssal plains of Aquabyssos, far from any major settlement. Standing nearly 200 feet tall, this ancient monument depicts a winged figure with arms outstretched, once meant to represent divine protection over the depths. However, centuries of shadow corruption have transformed it into something far more sinister.

## Atmospheric Description

The statue emerges from the absolute darkness of the ocean floor like a nightmare given form. Bioluminescent algae clings to its surface, creating an eerie, pulsating glow that shifts between deep blues and sickly greens. The angel's stone face, once serene, now bears an expression of eternal anguish, with dark fissures running like tears from its hollow eyes.

The water around the statue feels heavier, more oppressive. Currents seem to move in unnatural patterns, creating a perpetual whirlpool around the monument's base. The silence here is profound—even the constant background hum of the deep ocean seems muted in the angel's presence.

Strange coral formations have grown up the statue's legs and torso, resembling reaching hands or grasping tendrils. These formations pulse with an internal light that mirrors the statue's own corruption, creating a hypnotic pattern that can draw unwary travelers closer.

### The Corruption
Shadow corruption has seeped deep into the statue's stone, creating:
- **Weeping Shadows**: Dark ichor that constantly seeps from the statue's eyes and wounds
- **Twisted Prayers**: The carved inscriptions at the base have been warped into blasphemous text
- **Living Stone**: Sections of the statue occasionally shift and move as if the angel is slowly awakening
- **Void Resoce**: The statue hums with an otherworldly frequency that can be felt in one's bones

### The Weeping Chamber
Within the statue's chest cavity lies a hidden chamber accessible through a crack that appears only during certain tidal conditions. The chamber contains:
- Ancient religious texts, their pages somehow preserved
- A corrupted altar still radiating faint divine energy
- Pools of shadow-tainted holy water
- The remains of the last priest who tended the shrine

### The Whispering Wings
The statue's wings generate constant, barely audible whispers in ancient languages. Those who understand the words report hearing:
- Warnings about the rise of shadow corruption
- Prophecies about the Seven Shards
- Pleas for salvation and purification
- Accusations against those who failed to protect the depths

### The Beacon Light
Despite its corruption, the statue still emits a beacon of light from its crown during the darkest hours. This light:
- Can be seen from up to 10 miles away
- Attracts both pilgrims seeking redemption and monsters drawn to power
- Pulses in a rhythm that matches no known tidal pattern
- Grows brighter in the presence of divine magic

### Ancient Origins
The Angel of the Depths was constructed over 1,000 years ago during the Golden Age of Aquabyssos, when the relationship between the surface and depths was more harmonious. Built by a coalition of surface priests and deep-dwelling faithful, it served as:
- A waypoint for pilgrims traveling to sacred sites
- A lighthouse guiding vessels through treacherous waters
- A focal point for religious ceremonies
- A symbol of divine protection over all who dwelt beneath the waves

### The Great Corruption
Approximately 300 years ago, when shadow corruption first began spreading through Aquabyssos, the Angel of the Depths was among the first major monuments to be affected. The corruption didn't destroy the statue but transformed it into something that reflected the growing darkness in the world.

Pilgrims who still venture here report that the statue seems to be fighting an internal battle between its original blessed nature and the shadow corruption that now infuses it.

### Recent Events
In the past decade, activity around the statue has increased dramatically:
- Strange lights have been seen emanating from the Weeping Chamber
- Expeditions from both Aquabyssos and surface nations have investigated the site
- Several powerful clerics have attempted purification rituals, all ending in failure or worse
- The statue's whispers have grown more urgent and coherent

### Brother Matthias the Penitent
*Corrupted Human Cleric, Chaotic Good*

The last official caretaker of the Angel of the Depths, Brother Matthias refused to abandon his post when the corruption began. Now, he exists in a state between life and death, his body sustained by the same shadow energy that corrupts the statue.

**Appearance**: Gaunt and pale, with eyes that glow with the same bioluminescent light as the statue. His priest's robes have fused with his flesh in places.

**Personality**: Desperate to fulfill his sacred duty despite his corruption. He believes that if he can perform the proper rituals, he can cleanse both himself and the statue.

**Role**: Provides warnings about the statue's dangers, offers quests to gather purification materials, serves as a tragic example of corruption's effects.

### The Depth Wraiths
*Undead Sea Spirits*

The tortured souls of pilgrims who died near the statue, now bound to its corrupted presence. They appear as translucent figures wreathed in bioluminescent mist.

**Behavior**: Initially hostile but can be reasoned with by those showing proper respect for their sacred mission.

**Abilities**: Phase through solid matter, drain life energy, generate terrifying wails that can shatter glass and deafen travelers.

### The Guardian Leviathan
*Ancient Corrupted Sea Beast*

A massive sea creature that has appointed itself the statue's protector. Once blessed by the original priests, it now struggles with its own corruption while trying to prevent further desecration of the site.

**Description**: 80-foot-long serpentine creature with crystalline scales that reflect the statue's light patterns.

**Motivation**: Protects the statue from those it deems unworthy while allowing genuine pilgrims to approach.

### The Purification Quest
**Level**: 8-12
Brother Matthias believes he has discovered a way to cleanse the statue using artifacts from the Seven Shards. The party must gather these items while avoiding the political implications of their actions.

### The Whispered Prophecy
**Level**: 5-8
The statue's whispers have revealed the location of a lost temple that may hold the key to stopping shadow corruption's spread. The party must decipher the prophecy while dealing with other factions who also seek this knowledge.

### The Midnight Pilgrimage
**Level**: 3-6
A group of surface dwellers seeks to make a pilgrimage to the statue during a rare astronomical alignment. The party must escort them safely through dangerous waters while protecting them from both monsters and their own religious fervor.

### The Corruption's Source
**Level**: 10-15
Investigation reveals that the statue's corruption didn't occur naturally—it was deliberately caused by agents of the shadow. The party must uncover this conspiracy while preventing the statue from becoming a weapon against both Aquabyssos and the surface world.

### The True Angel
The statue is not merely a monument but a prison. Sealed within its stone form is an actual celestial being that was captured during the early days of the corruption. Freeing this angel could provide a powerful ally against the shadow, but might also release something that has been driven mad by centuries of imprisonment.

### The Shard Connection
One of the Seven Shards lies hidden within the statue's base, its power both sustaining the angel's divine nature and feeding the corruption that torments it. Removing the shard could either cleanse or completely destroy the monument.

### The Deep Covet
The statue stands at the center of an ancient magical pact between the surface and the depths. As long as it stands—corrupted or not—this covet prevents an all-out war between the two realms. Its destruction would have catastrophic political consequences.

### Environmental Effects
**Shadow Corruption Aura** (500-foot radius)
- Living creatures must make a **DC 15** Wisdom saving throw every hour or gain one level of corruption

**Divine Resoce** (100-foot radius)
- Divine magic is enhanced, allowing spells to be cast at +1 level without using higher spell slots
- Turn Undead attempts gain advantage
- Corrupted creatures take `dice: 1d4` radiant damage each round

### Hazards
**Whispering Madness**
- **DC 16** Wisdom saving throw when first approaching the statue
- Failure results in being charmed for 1 hour, compelled to approach the statue
- Critical failure causes temporary madness (`dice: 1d4` hours)

**Statue's Gaze**
- When the statue's eyes begin to glow, all creatures within 120 feet must make **DC 18** Constitution saves
- Failure causes paralysis for 1 minute as the target experiences visions of their deepest fears
- Success grants resistance to necrotic damage for 24 hours

### Treasure
**Hidden within the Weeping Chamber:**
- *Angel's Tear* (Rare): A crystal that can cast *Greater Restoration* once per day
- *Corrupted Prayer Book* (Very Rare): Allows the casting of both divine and shadow spells
- *Depth Guardian's Scale* (Legendary): Armor component that provides immunity to pressure effects
