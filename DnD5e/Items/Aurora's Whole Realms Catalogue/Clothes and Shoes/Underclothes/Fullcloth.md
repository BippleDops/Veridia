## Description
For those who plan a visit to the Great Glacier and for those who simply must have the warmest clothing money can buy, we offer our fullcloth. Far larger than a mere loincloth, a fullcloth warms a person from shoulders to ankles. Sewn from two layers of thick-woven linen between which lies a layer of wool culled from Moonshae sheep, our durable body cloths let you survive the coldest blasts of air.

## Additional Details
Gnome: 1 gp; halfling: 3 gp; elf: 5 gp; human: 8 gp. Available only in gray or beige.
