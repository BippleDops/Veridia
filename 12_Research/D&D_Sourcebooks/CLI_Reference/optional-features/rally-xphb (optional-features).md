# Rally
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 95*  

As a [[Action Xphb]], you can expend one Superiority Die to bolster the resolve of a companion. Choose an ally of yours within 30 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains [[temporary-hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] equal to the Superiority Die roll plus half your Fighter level (round down).
