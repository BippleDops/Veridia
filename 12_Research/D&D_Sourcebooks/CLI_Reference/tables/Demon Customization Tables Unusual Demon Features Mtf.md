| 3 | Ever-Open Extra Eye. The demon gains advantage on Perception checks related to sight. |
| 4 | Bleeds Wasps. The first time in each combat the demon is reduced to half its hit points or less, a [[swarm-of-insects-xmm (beast)]] forms around it. The swarm considers creatures other than the demon to be enemies. |

| 14 | Worm Tongue. The demon can't speak any language. |

| 17 | Immaterial. The demon has resistance to all damage except psychic damage, and all damage it deals is halved. |
| 18 | Long Arms. The demon's reach is 5 feet longer than normal. |
