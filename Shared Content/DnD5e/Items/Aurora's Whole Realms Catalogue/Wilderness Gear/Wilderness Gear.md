# Wilderness Gear
## Overview
For every bejeweled city of Toril, there are a thousand square miles of wilderness. Those bent on adventure will find themselves more often than not among the trees and grasses instead of the streets and buildings. Our compact wilderness gear can provide adventurers a home in most any environment without encumbrances that stop adventurers in their tracks. 

What could be more comforting to the wayfarer than a sturdy tent to turn the chill [[Winds|winds]] of Icewind Dale or the insects of Chult? Many times on my adventures I longed for such helps.
