## Description
A fool is known by his clothing, if by nothing else. Our jester clothing is one-size fits all: small jesters swim comically in the clothes, while massive fellows strain the seams—jester clothes are better when they don’t fit! This outfit comes with a floppy three-cornered hat with bells on each tip (3 gp), a star-shaped collar also with bells (1 gp), a poufy shirt of satin (10 gp), white [[Gloves|gloves]] (7 sp), bunchy pantaloons (8 gp), bright [[Stockings|stockings]] (8 sp), and buffoonish shoes (12 gp). Each piece comes in red, yellow, green, blue, black, or white. Best used with [[Makeup|makeup]]. Set: 25 gp
