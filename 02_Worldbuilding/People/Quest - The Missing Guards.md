# Quest - The Missing Guards

![[04_Resources/Assets/Art/NPCs/Quest_-_The_Missing_Guards.png|Quest - The Missing Guards Portrait]]

## Role and Motive
Quest - The Missing Guards moves information and influence like currency. Publicly pragmatic, privately driven by a personal stake in the Convergence’s shape.

- Ideal: Stability through controlled risk.
- Bond: A family archive tied to [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Lighthouse of Storms.md|The Lighthouse of Storms]].
- Flaw: Overconfidence in leverage; underestimates zealots and true believers.

## Tactics and Traits
- Conversational Disarm: First parley each day imposes disadvantage on Insight checks to read their tells.
- Ledger of Debts: Knows a favor owed by agents linked to [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Elena Starweaver.md|Elena Starweaver]].
- Contingency: Keeps a sealed route toward [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/The Whispering Expanse.md|The Whispering Expanse]] if negotiations sour.

## For the Table (Use Now)
- Opening Line: “Prices rise with fear; calm your breath and we can afford the truth.”
- Quick Offers: passage papers, rumor bundles, bonded cargo, introductions to a discreet artificer.
- Failure Still Progresses: Even when rebuffed, Quest - The Missing Guards sends a warning of a raid that creates a time-sensitive window.

## Relationships (score -3..+3)
- Pearl Guard customs captain: 0 (mutual irritation)
- Coral Throne Syndicate quartermaster: +2 (profitable ties)
- Verdant Accord observer: -1 (ideological friction)

## Hooks to the Main Campaign
- Offers a map shard pointing toward [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Lighthouse of Storms.md|The Lighthouse of Storms]].
- Brokers a ceasefire to enable [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/The Whispering Expanse.md|The Whispering Expanse]].
- Sells a rumor naming [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Elena Starweaver.md|Elena Starweaver]] as the true buyer behind a recent theft.
