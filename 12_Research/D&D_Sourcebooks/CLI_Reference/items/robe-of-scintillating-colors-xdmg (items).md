*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)* This robe has 3 charges, and it regains`d3`expended charges daily at dawn. While you wear it, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action and expend 1 charge to cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until the end of your next turn. During this time, the robe sheds [[Light Xphb]] in a 30-foot radius and [[Light Xphb]] for an additional 30 feet, and creatures that can see you have [[Advantage Xphb]] on attack rolls against you. Any creature in the [[Light Xphb]] that can see you when the robe's power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[conditions#Stunned|Stunned]] condition until the effect ends. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 297.
