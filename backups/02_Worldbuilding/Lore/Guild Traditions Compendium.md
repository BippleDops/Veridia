## Player-Facing Summary

The Guild Traditions Compendium provides comprehensive information about the professional organizations that shape economic and social life across both realms. Understanding these traditions enables characters to join professional guilds, advance in their chosen careers, and navigate the complex relationships between different professional groups.

## Lore Details

Guild traditions represent some of the most stable and enduring aspects of both realm cultures, having evolved over centuries to preserve essential knowledge while adapting to changing circumstances. These traditions serve multiple functions: they ensure professional quality, create social bonds among practitioners, preserve technical knowledge, and provide frameworks for professional advancement and community contribution.

The development of cross-realm professional organizations represents one of the most successful examples of cultural integration, demonstrating how shared professional values can bridge even significant cultural differences. Many guild traditions have evolved to accommodate practitioners from both realms while maintaining their essential character and effectiveness.

## Adventure Hooks

- A mysterious plague is affecting guild masters across multiple professions, threatening to destroy centuries of accumulated professional knowledge
