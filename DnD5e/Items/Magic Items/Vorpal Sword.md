## Description
You gain a +3 bonus to [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] and damage rolls made with this [[Magic Weapon|magic weapon]]. In addition, the weapon ignores [[17 - Damage and Healing|resistance]] to [[17 - Damage and Healing|slashing]] damage.

When you [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature’s heads. The creature dies if it can’t survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to [[17 - Damage and Healing|slashing]] damage, doesn’t have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra `dice: 6d8` (6d8) [[17 - Damage and Healing|slashing]] damage from the hit.
