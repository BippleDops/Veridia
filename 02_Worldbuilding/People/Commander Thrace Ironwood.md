*The Steel Fist of Purity, Former Crystal Warden Turned Crusader*

## Overview
Commander Thrace Ironwood leads the military wing of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Purist Coalition]], bringing tactical expertise and bitter personal experience to their war against crystal corruption. A former Crystal Warden who witnessed his entire unit corrupted during a routine patrol, he represents the Coalition's more militant approach while struggling with the trauma that drove him to extremism. His strategic brilliance and uncompromising dedication make him both the Coalition's greatest asset and their most dangerous liability.
