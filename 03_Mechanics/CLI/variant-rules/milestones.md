# Milestones
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 261* 

You can also award XP when characters complete significant milestones. When preparing your adventure, designate certain events or challenges as milestones, as with the following examples:

- Accomplishing one in a series of goals necessary to complete the adventure.  
- Discovering a hidden location or piece of information relevant to the adventure.  
- Reaching an important destination.  

When awarding XP, treat a major milestone as a hard encounter and a minor milestone as an easy encounter. If you want to reward your players for their progress through an adventure with something more than XP and treasure, give them additional small rewards at milestone points. Here are some examples:

- The adventurers gain the benefit of a short rest.  
- Characters can recover a Hit Die or a low-level spell slot.  
- Characters can regain the use of magic items that have had their limited uses expended.

## Player-Facing Summary

Milestones is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of milestones as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around milestones.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties milestones to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at milestones to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to milestones active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
