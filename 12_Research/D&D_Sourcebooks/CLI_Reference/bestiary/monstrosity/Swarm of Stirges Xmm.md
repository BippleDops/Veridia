# [[swarm-of-stirges-xmm|Swarm of Stirges]]
*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 299*  

Swarms of stirges sometimes form in swamps and Underdark caverns, draining livestock and any other creatures that can't escape them.

## Stirges

*Notorious, Clinging Bloodsuckers*

- **Habitat.** Desert, Forest, Grassland, Hill, Mountain, Swamp, Underdark, Urban  
- **Treasure.** None  

Stirges are bat-size vermin with dagger-length proboscises that attach to other creatures and drain life from them. Stirges are most active at night and hide in shadowy places during the day. If disturbed, they take flight and defend themselves. Roll on or choose a result from the Stirge Roosts table to inspire where stirges might lurk.
