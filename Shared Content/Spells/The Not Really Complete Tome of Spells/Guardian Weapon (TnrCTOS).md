# Guardian Weapon (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a drop of your sweat or spittle and a pebble)

**Duration**: Until triggered


## Effects
You create an invisible field of force shaped like a weapon of your choice; you use this force to guard a doorway or other area and assign it a password.

If that area is disturbed by someone who does not first speak the password, the weapon strikes. It only attacks once but it automatically hits and does 4d12 damage appropriate to its type and the target is stunned for 1 minute. The target must also make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
