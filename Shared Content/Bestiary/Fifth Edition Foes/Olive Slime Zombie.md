## Special Traits
**Death Throes:** When a slime zombie is reduced to 0 hit points, it collapses into a full-strength puddle of [[Slime, Olive|olive slime]].

**Telepathic Bond:** A slime zombie is linked telepathically with the patch of [[Slime, Olive|olive slime]] that created it and with all other slime zombies linked to that patch of olive slime. This link has a maximum range of 20 miles. The slime zombie and olive slime must be on the same plane of existence.

**[[Slime, Olive|Olive Slime]] Infestation:** Any amount of olive slime that remains in contact with a potential victim for more than two minutes charms the victim and alters his or her thinking patterns so that the host's main concern becomes feeding and protecting the olive slime"including keeping the slime hidden from companions. If anyone tries to remove the olive slime from the host, the host does whatever is required to protect the slime, whether it's running away or fighting back. As long as the host is alive and conscious, it will do everything in its power to protect the slime, including knocking out or even killing its friends. An infested creature suffers the following effects.

## Actions
**Fist:*** Melee Attack*: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d8+1`) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to notice the [[Slime, Olive|olive slime]] smeared on it. If the olive slime is noticed and removed immediately, it has no effect. If the olive slime is not noticed and removed within two minutes, the creature loses 1 point of Constitution and is infested with olive slime; see above.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Underground

**Organization**: Mob (1–20)

## Description
[[Slime, Olive|Olive slime]] zombies (or slime creatures) are created when a living creature dies from olive slime infestation. The slime zombie’s sole purpose in existence is to capture or kill new prey for its master (i.e., the olive slime that created it).

A slime zombie resembles a humanoid blob, olive drab in color. The creature has no distinguishing marks or facial features; its face has the rough shape of a humanoid face, but it is lumpy and gelatinous. The same applies to its entire body; the skin is translucent, revealing outlines of interior shapes that resemble the creature’s original bones and organs, but it is olive slime throughout.

An olive slime zombie can communicate telepathically with the olive slime that controls it and with others of its kind, but it never speaks or makes any other sound.
