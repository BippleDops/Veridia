## Description
The censer is a portable [[Incense|incense]] [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Priests' Alcove/Brazier|burner]] common to priests of both temple and trail. Our censers come in gold (5 gp), silver (3 gp), and brass (1 gp), all of which are ornamentally inlaid and can burn up to 6 ounces of [[Incense|incense]] at a time. While the portable [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Priests' Alcove/Brazier|brazier]] provides the adventuring priest with a stable base for [[Incense|incense]] burning, the censer allows that base to move.

## Additional Details
+10 yards (if applicable) to range of any [[Incense|incense]]-using spell; when carried burning, gives party -3 penalty to surprise and negates NPC/monster surprise
