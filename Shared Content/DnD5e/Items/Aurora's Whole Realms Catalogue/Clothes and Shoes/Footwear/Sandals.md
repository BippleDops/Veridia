## Description
We are proud to once again be the only merchant house outside of Calimshan to offer [[Calishite]] sandals. Ours are made of fine grain leather, with full brass buckles, and sell for only 2 gp a pair. They shield the feet from hot sand while allowing breezes to cool them. Available to you in brown, black and white.
