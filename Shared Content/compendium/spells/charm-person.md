You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting it.

The [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed) creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows it was [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed) by you.
