In their pride, they were tricked into invading the Feywild to claim its magic for their own. When the archfey rulers of that realm united, the fomorians were turned back and cursed with supernatural strangeness to make their bodies match their vile souls. Ever since, fomorians have dwelled in the Underdark amid the ruins of their magical cities. The archfey's curse afflicts them still, tormenting them with wandering cankers, lurching organs, and stranger discomforts. Rather than atoning for their offenses, fomorians harness the magic of their curse and turn it against others. Roll on or choose a result from the Fomorian Warping table to inspire the cosmetic effects a creature undergoes while they're affected by a fomorian's Warping Hex. **Fomorian Warping**`dice: [](fomorian-xmm.md#^fomorian-warping)`| dice: 1d4 | The Fomorian's Hex Causes... |

| 1 | Colorful, wandering pustules. |
| 2 | Excessive sweating of rainbow-hued fluids. |
| 3 | Patches of wriggling hair. |
| 4 | Veins that bulge and lurch under the skin. |

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of fomorian xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around fomorian xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[fomorian-xmm (giant)]]
