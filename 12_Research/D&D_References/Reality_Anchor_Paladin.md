# Reality Anchor Paladin - Character Build

## Overview
The Reality Anchor Paladin represents a sacred order dedicated to maintaining stability between [[Aquabyssos]] and [[Aethermoor]], preventing reality breaches, and protecting both worlds from dimensional threats. These paladins have sworn divine oaths to preserve the integrity of existence itself, serving as living anchors that stabilize reality through divine will and unwavering determination.

## Core Concept
Reality Anchors are paladins who have devoted themselves to the cosmic duty of maintaining dimensional stability. They can sense reality distortions, seal dimensional breaches, and resist corruption from entities that exist outside normal space and time. Many serve in specialized military units, work with reality research institutions, or operate as independent agents protecting communities from dimensional threats.
