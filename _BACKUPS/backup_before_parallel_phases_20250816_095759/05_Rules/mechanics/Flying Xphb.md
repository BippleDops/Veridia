--- # Flying

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 367. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* A variety of effects allow a creature to fly. While flying, you fall if you have the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated or [conditions#prone|Prone]] condition or your [[Fly Speed Xphb is reduced to 0. You can stay aloft in those circumstances if you can hover. [Dn D5e-Side Screen-2024]] ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Flying xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of flying xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around flying xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The First Prophecy of Winds ## Plot Hooks - Strange sightings suggest a conspiracy
