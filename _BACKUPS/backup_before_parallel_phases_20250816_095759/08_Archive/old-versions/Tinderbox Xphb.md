*Adventuring gear* - **Cost**: 5 sp
- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs. A Tinderbox is a small container holding flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a [[Candle Xphb, [lamp-xphb (items)]], [[Hooded Lantern Xphb, or [Torch Xphb]]â€”or anything else with exposed fuelâ€”takes a [[Action Xphb. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute. *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 229.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of tinderbox xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around tinderbox xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
