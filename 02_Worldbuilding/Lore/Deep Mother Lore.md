Deep Mother Lore encompasses the collected knowledge, myths, prophecies, and religious teachings about the primordial oceanic entity known as the Deep Mother. This body of knowledge includes ancient texts, oral traditions, scientific observations, and theological interpretations from scholars across both realms attempting to understand her nature and influence. ### Duration

Accumulated knowledge base requiring ongoing research and validation. ## Adventure Hooks

1. **Ancient Texts**: Discovery of lost Deep Mother scriptures
2. Moreover, **Prophetic Vision**: Character receives cryptic oceanic visions
3. **Scholarly Debate**: Competing interpretations of Deep Mother's nature ## Campaign Use

Provides background lore for Deep Mother encounters and serves as source for prophecies and ancient knowledge. ## Player-Facing Summary Deep Mother Lore is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Deep Mother Lore as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Deep Mother Lore. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - The authorities needs help delivering before the festival
