# Quaal's Feather Token, Bird
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/quaals-feather-token-bird.webp#right)

This object looks like a feather.

You can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a [[Roc Xmm]], but it can't attack. It obeys your simple commands and can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles per hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a 1-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying) or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]]. You can dismiss the bird as a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action.
