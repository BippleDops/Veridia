--- # Passive Perception

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 372. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* Passive Perception is a score that reflects a creature's general awareness of its surroundings. The DM uses this score when determining whether a creature notices something without consciously making a Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception) check. A creature's Passive Perception equals 10 plus the creature's Wisdom ([skills#Perception|Perception]]) check bonus. If the creature has [[Advantage Xphb on such checks, increase the score by 5. If the creature has [Advantage Xphb]] on them, decrease the score by 5. For example, a level 1 character with a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception has a Passive Perception of 14 (`10 + 2 + 2`). If that character has [[Advantage Xphb on Wisdom ([skills#Perception|Perception]]) checks, the score becomes 19 (`10 + 2 + 2 + 5`). ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Passive perception xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
