*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 282* - **Ability Scores**: str +1 dex +2
- **Size**: Small
- **Speed**: 20 ft.
- **Spellcasting**: Intelligence ### Innate Spellcasting You have an innate ability to cast the following spells, requiring no material components: - **At will.** [[nondetection-xphb (spells)]] (self only) - **1/day each.** [[blindness-deafness-xphb (spells)]], [[blur-xphb (spells)]], [[disguise-self-xphb (spells)]] Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells. ### Stone Camouflage You have advantage on Dexterity ([[skills#Stealth|Stealth]]) checks to hide in rocky terrain. ### Gnome Cunning You have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic. ### Superior Darkvision Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. ### Languages You can speak, read, and write Gnomish, Terran, and Undercommon. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Gnome deep dmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of gnome deep dmg as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around gnome deep dmg. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A prisoner has gone missing and war looms
