# The Tenebrarum Ambassadors
*Voices from the Shadow Realm, Diplomats of the Dark Current*

## Overview
The Tenebrarum Ambassadors represent a mysterious shadow realm that exists parallel to both Aquabyssos and the surface world. These diplomatic figures serve as intermediaries between their shadowy domain and the underwater kingdom, negotiating treaties, trade agreements, and mutual defense pacts. Their embassy, located in the darkest districts of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Abyssos Prime]], operates under ancient diplomatic immunities while pursuing their realm's complex political agenda.

The Tenebrarum realm itself is described as a place where shadows have substance and light creates darkness, where the normal rules of reality bend to accommodate beings of living shadow. The Ambassadors claim their realm has existed alongside the material world since ancient times, but only recently began formal diplomatic contact with Aquabyssos following the Great Drowning.
