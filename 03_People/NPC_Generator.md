- -- ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements * 20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary NPC Generator is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. Subsequently, ## Lore Details Legends speak of NPC Generator as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around NPC Generator. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Plot Hooks - A journal reveals a betrayal about the government - A document has gone missing and chaos spreads ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## Stats```statblock creature: Custom NPC```### Quick Stats - **AC**: *[Armor Class]*
