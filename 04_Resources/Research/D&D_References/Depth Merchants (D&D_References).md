*Where the Deep Ocean Yields Its Treasures* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview The Depth Merchants district represents [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos's most ambitious commercial endeavor - a thriving trading hub built in the crushing depths of the deep ocean, where few dare to venture and fewer still can survive. Located at depths ranging from 3,000 to 5,000 feet below the surface, this merchant quarter specializes in the extraction, processing, and trade of resources that can only be found in the deepest reaches of the ocean. More than just a market, the Depth Merchants district is a testament to aquatic ingenuity and adaptation. The entire community has evolved to thrive under extreme pressure conditions that would instantly kill surface dwellers and crush most inhabitants of the shallower regions of [Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]. The merchants here deal in goods and services that exist nowhere else in the known world - from pressure-forged metals that are stronger than any surface alloy, to bioluminescent organisms that create light without heat, to the mysterious memory crystals that form only in the crushing darkness of the deep trenches. The district serves as both the primary supplier of deep-ocean resources to the rest of [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos and as a crucial waystation for explorers, researchers, and traders seeking to venture into the deepest and most dangerous parts of the underwater realm. Its merchants have developed a reputation for being able to acquire virtually anything from the depths - for the right price and with enough advance notice. ### Extreme Pressure Environment
