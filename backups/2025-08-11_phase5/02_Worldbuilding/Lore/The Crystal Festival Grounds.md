# The Crystal Festival Grounds

*"Where surface and sea unite in crystalline celebration."*

## Overview
The Crystal Festival Grounds is a specially prepared area on the surface that serves as the primary venue for the annual Crystal Festival, a major inter-realm celebration. The grounds feature terraced amphitheaters, crystal display pavilions, magical water features that allow underwater visitors to participate, and temporary portal stations for easy travel between realms.

## Historical Background
Established to provide a neutral meeting place where citizens of both realms could safely celebrate together, the grounds were designed by collaborative teams of surface and underwater architects.

## Current State
The grounds remain active year-round with smaller events and cultural exchanges, though the main Crystal Festival represents the peak of activity and attendance.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
- Extensive preparation for festival events
- Security coordination between both realms
- Magical infrastructure for underwater visitor accommodation
- Cultural sensitivity training for mixed-realm interactions

### Effects

- **Economic Boost**: Major trade and tourism activity
- **Diplomatic Opportunity**: Facilitates inter-realm negotiations

### Duration

2. **Cultural Incident**: Prevent diplomatic crisis during festival
3. **Underground Threat**: Investigate sabotage attempts at festival
