# Trap #8 - "Going Down?"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> This area is just a little length of corridor, a kind of small room with a door at the far end. The "room" is 20 feet long by 10 feet wide, by 10 feet high. The door at the far end has no visible locking , or opening mechanism, it is a blank stone panel, beside which hangs a gold chain with a leather wrapped grip on the end.
> 
> The party will try everything to open the door except pulling the chain. Eventually they will have managed to pull, bash or dig away the stone door, to reveal a metal plate beyond, and a runic inscription in an ancient version of the common tongue which reads, "Pulle Thye Chain!"
> 
> If the party decides to do so the floor of the room begins to descend; slowly at first but accelerating. If you lower it at just the right speed the party will stay with it for a fairly long time. At 15 feet down the the floor will trip a release that drops the steel plate door into a slot in the ground and [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] to the next room will be open. However the floor will keep going down and accelerating, like the out of control elevator that it is. ( Although Evinrood has chosen to let the victims of this trap drop what seems like forever, you can keep this up for hundreds of feet waiting until one of the party members says something really dim like, "Gee, when are we going to reach the bottom?" and then have the the floor crash to the "bottom" with results appropriate to a fall of the corresponding duration.)
> 
> A wise party will leave most of it's members on the stair, and possibly tie a rope to the hapless boob picked to pull the chain. In any event the door to the next room is opened by the action, as the floor will drop even if the delvers don't. Rescue from the falling floor is al wayspossible with increasing degrees of difficulty, if the entire party doesn't go down with the floor. Evinrood had this shaft made virtually "bottomless". Nothing ties up a group of goody-goody delvers like a forlorn voice echoing up from this shaft begging for rescue, as the possibilities become more and more unlikely, and difficult!)
> 
> This trap has a variable rating depending on just how foolish the,party allows itself to be. Two or three skulls. Incidentally the gold chain is worth about 1,500 g.p. if the party has not forgotten about it entirely by now.
> 
> In any event once all the nattering and fooling around is over the party will in all likelihood press on to the next room and ...
