--- # Summon Undead

*3rd-level, Necromancy* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/summon-undead.webp#right) - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gilded skull worth 300+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour You call forth an Undead spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the [[undead-spirit-xphb (undead)]] stat block. When you cast the spell, choose the creature's form: Ghostly, Putrid, or Skeletal. The spirit resembles an Undead creature with the chosen form, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] or when the spell ends. The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your [[Initiative Xphb]] count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [[actions#Dodge|Dodge]] action and uses its movement to avoid danger. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block. **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 328* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Summon undead xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of summon undead xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around summon undead xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
