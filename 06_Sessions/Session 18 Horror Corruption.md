### Horror Overview
**Tone:** Psychological horror with body horror elements  
**Location:** Shadowhaven District, Lower Depths  
**Threat:** Crystal Plague outbreak + Deep Mother influence  
**Duration:** 3.5 hours of mounting dread  

### The Setup

The party arrived in Shadowhaven to investigate reports of an entire district going silent. No communications, no trade, no life signs - just an eerie quiet in what was once the busiest criminal district in Aquabyssos.

#### Stage 1: Unnatural Silence (30 minutes)
**Atmosphere:** Empty streets, abandoned buildings, no sea life
**Clues:** 
- Still-warm meals left on tables
- Doors left open mid-conversation
- Currency and valuables ignored
- Time seemed to move strangely

**Character Reactions:**
- Marcus's ranger senses detected wrongness in ecosystem
- Kestra's music echoed unnaturally in the silence
- Thane felt reality anchoring strain against unknown force
- Lyralei couldn't sense any natural life patterns
- Serafina recognized signs of mass surgical intervention

#### Stage 2: The Changed Ones (45 minutes)
**Discovery:** Inhabitants still present but... altered
**Manifestations:**
- Citizens with glowing crystal growths replacing eyes
- People moving in perfect synchronization
- Individuals speaking in unison across distances
- Bodies showing surgical modifications

**Horror Moments:**
- Child asking for help with adult voice
- Shopkeeper continuing sales pitch with empty eye sockets
- Crowd moving as single organism
- Familiar NPCs not recognizing the party

#### Stage 3: The Surgical Gardens (60 minutes)
**Location:** Former marketplace converted to operation theater
**Scene:** Mass surgery in progress, victims conscious but compliant
**Key Horror:** People volunteering for transformation

**Disturbing Elements:**
- Patients arranging themselves on tables
- Surgery performed by other patients
- No screaming despite absence of anesthesia
- Crystal growths pulsing in rhythm

**Player Agency:** Party had to decide whether to intervene, knowing they might become targets

#### Stage 4: The Source (90 minutes)
**Discovery:** Deep Mother avatar using Shadow Surgeon techniques
**Revelation:** Corruption isn't random - it's coordinated transformation
**Climax:** Choice between stopping transformation or saving specific individuals

### Character Horror Moments

**Kestra:** Found her music being used to coordinate transformations
**Marcus:** Watched ecosystem being deliberately corrupted
**Thane:** Reality anchoring caused physical pain in transformed areas
**Lyralei:** Storm magic attracted unwanted attention from changed ones
**Serafina:** Recognized her own surgical techniques being used

### Player Safety & Comfort

**Safety Tools Used:**
- X-Card available but not needed
- Regular check-ins on comfort level
- Clear description boundaries established
- Focus on psychological over graphic horror

**Player Feedback:**
- Tension level appropriate for group
- Horror enhanced rather than overshadowed story
- Character agency maintained throughout
- Effective use of atmosphere and pacing
