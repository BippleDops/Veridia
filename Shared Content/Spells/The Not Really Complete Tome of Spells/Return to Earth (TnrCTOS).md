# Return to Earth (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (30-foot radius)

**Components**: V, M (a pinch of dust)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
All corporeal undead within 30 feet of you that have fewer than 50 hit points must make a Constitution saving throw. An undead takes 5d10 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one. If an undead is reduced to 0 hit points, it crumbles into dust.
