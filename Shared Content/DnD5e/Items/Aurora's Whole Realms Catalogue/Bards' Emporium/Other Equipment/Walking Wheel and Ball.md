## Description
A common sight in the magnificent marketplaces of Calimshan, the walking wheel and walking ball have only recently entered the streets of the Heartlands. The wheel (4 gp) is simply a broad steel hoop with countless uses: it can be held up and jumped through, rolled along the ground with a stick, stood atop and turned slowly beneath the feet, crawled inside to roll head-over-heels down a hill, and so forth. The walking ball (7 gp) is a 15-pound sphere of granite atop which bards can learn to [[Balance|balance]], walk, and even run.
