## Overview

The Silverscale Emergency Bunker is a heavily fortified underground facility designed to protect key personnel and resources during catastrophic events affecting Aethermoor. Built by the Silverscale [[Organization using both surface and underwater engineering techniques, it represents one of the most secure locations in the surface realm. The bunker features advanced life support systems, magical [Shield]]ing, and secure [[Communication Networks [Link]]ing it to both realms.

## Historical Background

Constructed during a period of increasing inter-realm tensions, the bunker was designed to serve as a command center and refuge for Silverscale leadership during crises. Its creation required unprecedented cooperation between surface architects and underwater pressure-engineering specialists.

## Current State

The bunker remains on standby alert, fully stocked and ready for immediate occupation. Recent [[Dimensional Instabilities have triggered several false alarms, leading to reviews of activation protocols.

### Duration

Designed for sustained operation up to one year without external support.
