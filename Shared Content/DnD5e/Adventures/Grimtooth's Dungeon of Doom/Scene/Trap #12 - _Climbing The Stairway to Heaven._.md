# Trap #12 - "Climbing The Stairway to Heaven."
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> Opening the door to the left has a profound effect. Once the party has operated the three finger mechanism the door will swing out, dumping a billow of fog into the room. The fog seems harmless, and after the initial surge it becomes a steady ankle high flow. What the tomb robbers will see is what looks like a water fall of fog billowing from the top of what seems to be stairs. At the top is a white light of unusual brightness. The light is of coarse magic in nature, and seems to be set above a door at the top of the stairs. The only way the party can tell there are stairs is because of the peculiar rippling effect the fog takes as it nears the bottom.
> 
> The stairs are 40 feet long and 10 feet wide, with a 15 foot high ceiling. Once the party overcomes it's initial fear of the fog, they will head up the stairs. (Cries of, "Run it's a corrosive acid!", or "Yieee ! Poison gas!" are enough to make me wish it really was, but enough of that wishful thinking.) Keep in mind there is a blinding light all around them from the ceiling above the door. When they come within 10 feet of the door at the top, then the fun will begin.
> 
> The fog is being generated in a deep steel-lined pit. (30 feet deep and 10 feet in width and breadth.) At the bottom of the pit, gratings permit a warm, slow inflow of water from the subterranian river. The sides are cooled so that a fog is sure to boil up out of the pit almost at all times. Oh my! Did I forget to mention the spikes. How inhospitable of me.
> 
> There is nothing but the use of their native intelligence that can save the lead members of the party from falling into the pit. (I'd be suspicious, but then I know Evinrood's rep.) Unless the victim(s) is equipped with inpenetrable armor there is little hope for survival.
> 
> The hi-jinks supplied by the party as it tries to rescue the fallen member and the tribulations of the delvers as they attempt to open the door at the top will provide additional amusement.
> 
> This is a three skull trap, good but don't be surprised if a particularly canny delver anticipates it.
> 
> The door at the top is the usual three finger hole type, but it will provide some problems. You see, it opens outward. (Now me, I'd provide it with a spring, but then I'm not a nice fellow!)
