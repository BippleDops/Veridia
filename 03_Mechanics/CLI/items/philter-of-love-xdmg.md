# Philter of Love
*Potion, uncommon*  


- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you are [charmed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed) by that creature and have the [Charmed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed) condition for 1 hour.

This rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.
