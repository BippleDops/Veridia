# Spike Growth
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (seven thorns)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

The ground in a 20-foot-radius [[sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]] centered on a point within range sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes [[difficult-terrain-xphb|Difficult Terrain]] for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes `2d4` Piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area when the spell is cast must take a [[actions#Search|Search]] action and succeed on a Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]] or [[skills#Survival|Survival]]) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.
