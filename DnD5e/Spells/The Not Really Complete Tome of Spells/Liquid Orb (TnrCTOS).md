## Overview
**Level**: *cantrip*

**School**: *Conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 10 minutes


## Effects
You create a pint of any nonflammable, nonacidic liquid you wishâ€”water, juice, dye, ink, mediocre beer, chicken broth, etc. It appears as a sphere and remains that way through magical surface tension.
