# Trap #5 - "Just When You Thought It Was Safe ... "
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The stairs are a trap: any delver who can't figure this out deserves the old "step on the stairs and have them turn into a slide" bit. This is exactly what happens when the first weight of any substantial amount is placed on the upper surface of any of the steps. (Yes, I know this is so old the dinosaurs stopped laughing at it, but just wait.)
> 
> After the first "victim" ( or what ever "weight" that was used to trip the "trap") reaches the doors at the bottom the "real" trap will be set The weight of the first slidee will depress the end portion of the slide. This activates a second pressure plate in the center of the slide. When the next member of the party attempts to descend the slide, either by sliding (which is to be wished) or rappelling down on a rope, he will depress this plate, releasing a spinning disk of metal on a moving arm from the right hand wall 2 and 1/2 feet above the surface of the slide.
> 
> Inside the wall is an hydraulically driven piston (see sketch) that presses against a shaft that has the metal disk mounted to it by an axle pin through it's center point. Around the axle is wound a short stout rope fastened to the stone wall at the back of gallery. As the shaft advances the rope unwinds imparting a spin to the metal wheel. The wheel, 20 feet in diameter, is pushed through the stucco into the corridor. Spinning merrily it should cut through anyone in it's path. There is a 30% chance a character might be able to lay prone out of its way (L3).
> 
> This trap is rated at 3 skulls for surprise and lethality. (A case could be made for having the blade dig into the opposite wall and stop short of hitting all the space 20 feet up and down the stair/slide way so it is not 100% efficient. Unfortunately!)
> 
> Once this trap has been tripped the corridor is safe enough if the party avoids the blade. It will be very difficult to loot this trap as the blade is very large and of an inferior grade of metal, sharp but brittle.
> 
> At the bottom we come to the doors, with their three holes again. This time the hole on the right is safe, just in case the party has gotten careless or cocky.
