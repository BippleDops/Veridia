# Empress Tethys the Ever-Drowning

*"I have died ten thousand times, and each death teaches me the same lesson: the surface world is a beautiful lie we tell ourselves while drowning."*

## Overview
Empress Tethys rules [[Aquabyssos]] through a unique curse/blessing - she drowns to death every dawn and resurrects every dusk, losing and regaining memories in fragments. She is simultaneously the most and least powerful being in the underwater realm, experiencing existence from infinite perspectives.

## Appearance (Varies by Time of Day)
### Dawn (Dying)
- Pale, waterlogged flesh pulling away from bones
- Eyes clouding over with death
- Speaks in gurgling whispers
- Water constantly pours from her mouth

### Noon (Dead)
- Corpse seated on the Obsidian Throne
- Perfectly preserved but clearly deceased
- Court continues around her body
- Strange prophecies written in condensation on her skin

### Dusk (Resurrecting)
- Flesh reconstituting, color returning
- Memories flooding back in waves
- Most lucid and dangerous time
- Eyes burn with accumulated knowledge

### Midnight (Full Power)
- Appears as she did at first transformation
- Beautiful in an alien, unsettling way
- Bioluminescent veins pulse with power
- Voice carries impossible authority

## Personality (Fragments)
- **The Innocent**: Remembers her surface childhood, kind but naive
- **The Warrior**: Recalls leading armies, brutal and strategic
- **The Scholar**: Focused on understanding the Drowning, analytical
- **The Mad Prophet**: Sees all timelines simultaneously, incomprehensible
- **The Loving Mother**: Remembers her drowned children, desperately protective
- **The Void Touched**: Has seen too deep, nihilistic and cruel

## The Multiple Tethys Theory
Unknown to most, each death creates a "temporal echo" of Tethys that descends to different depths:
- **Twilight Tethys**: The public face, maintains diplomacy
- **Midnight Tethys**: The true ruler, makes hard decisions
- **Hadean Tethys**: The thing she's becoming, alien and powerful
- **Surface Tethys**: A version that never drowned, exists in dreams

## Relationships
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Korvin Blacktide]]**: Her voice on the surface, carries fragments of her memories
- **The Tidal Council**: Fear and worship her in equal measure
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]**: Sees her as a sister in transformation
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]]**: Knows his true identity, considers him responsible for the Drowning
- **The Things That Dwell Beneath**: Her true masters, or perhaps her children

## Powers & Abilities

### The Drowning Cycle
- Cannot be permanently killed
- Each death grants visions of possible futures
- Resurrection pulls knowledge from the depths
- Can voluntarily drown others to share her experience

### Deep Magic Mastery
- Controls all water within her realm
- Can transform others with a touch
- Speaks all languages that have been drowned
- Commands the drowned dead

### Memory Manipulation
- Can extract, implant, or erase memories
- Experiences all her deaths simultaneously
- Can grant others temporary access to her memories
- Knows secrets that were drowned with their owners

## Current Schemes
1. **The Great Convergence**: Reuniting all versions of herself
2. **The Surface Mirror**: Creating reflection of Aquabyssos above water
3. **The Shard Drowning**: Acquiring one of Aethermoor's [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]]
4. **The Memory Harvest**: Collecting all drowned memories into herself
5. **The Final Transformation**: Becoming a Thing That Dwells Beneath

## DM Secrets
> [!danger] The Original Tethys
> The "real" Tethys died permanently 400 years ago. What rules now is an amalgamation of the collective unconscious of all who drowned, wearing her form. Each death/resurrection adds more voices to the collective.

> [!warning] The Prophecy
> Tethys has seen a future where she causes the Second Drowning, submerging all worlds. She's desperately trying to prevent this while her other selves work toward it. She is both the problem and solution.

> [!info] The Love That Remains
> Deep in her fractured memories, Tethys retains true love for someone on the surface - possibly an ancestor of someone in Aethermoor. This love is the only thing preventing her from fully embracing the void. If that person's descendant dies or is corrupted, she will lose her last anchor to humanity.

## Stats (Varies by Time)
### Midnight Form (Full Power)
**AC:** 20 (Natural armor + deep magic)
**HP:** 450 (Regenerates unless killed by surface magic)
**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 60 ft., teleport through water

**Abilities:**
- **Drowning Aura:** 30 ft radius, creatures must make CON saves or begin drowning
- **Memory Flood:** Can overwhelm minds with thousands of memories
- **Depth Pressure:** Can adjust pressure to crush or preserve
- **Resurrection Inevitable:** Returns at dusk regardless of how killed

**Spells:** All water/death/mind related spells up to 9th level

## Notable Possessions
- **The Coral Crown**: Controls all transformed beings
- **The Depth Scrolls**: Chronicles of every drowning death
- **The Last Breath**: Contained air from the surface world
- **Memory Pearls**: Crystallized memories of her past lives

## Court Protocols
- Never look directly at her during transformation
- Address her by the personality currently dominant
- Bring memories as tribute
- Accept her contradictory commands
- Never mention the surface during dawn

## Plot Hooks
- Seeks party to retrieve memories from the surface
- Offers transformation to save dying party member
- Needs help preventing/causing the Second Drowning
- Requests assassination of one of her other selves
- Wants to send message to her lost love's descendant
