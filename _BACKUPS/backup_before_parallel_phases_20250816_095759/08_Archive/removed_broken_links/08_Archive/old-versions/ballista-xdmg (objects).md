%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 96* A Ballista is a massive crossbow that fires heavy bolts. Loading a Ballista requires the [[actions#Utilize|Utilize action, and aiming it requires another [actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action. Then a crew member can take the Ballista Bolt action.```ad-statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of ballista xdmg as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around ballista xdmg. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
