## Player-Facing Summary

The Architects of Depths is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of The Architects of Depths as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Architects of Depths.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties The Architects of Depths to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at The Architects of Depths to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to The Architects of Depths active only during specific tides/storms.
