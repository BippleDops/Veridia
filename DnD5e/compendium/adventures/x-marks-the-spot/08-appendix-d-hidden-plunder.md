# Appendix D: Hidden Plunder
*Source: X Marks the Spot, p. 19* 

If you have the appropriate _Magic: The Gathering_ cards from the Ixalan set, you can create a deck and have players draw from it when they find a treasure. Otherwise, roll 1d6 on the table below.

**Hidden Plunder**

| 1d6 | Item Name (Card Name) |  | Description |
|-----|-----------------------|--|-------------|
| 1 | [Dowsing Dagger](/compendium/items/dowsing-dagger-xmts.md) |  | A curved jade blade fashioned by the River Heralds, this +1 dagger can detect the presence of fresh water within 200 feet of the wielder. |
| 2 | [Pirate's Cutlass](/compendium/items/pirates-cutlass-xmts.md) |  | This +1 shortsword is a terrifying weapon with a serrated edge. It grants its wielder advantage on Charisma ([Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation)) checks when brandished. |
| 3 | [Primal Amulet](/compendium/items/primal-amulet-xmts.md) |  | This beaded jade necklace bears an ancient symbol of the River Heralds. When worn, the primal amulet allows its wearer to cast [speak with animals](/compendium/spells/speak-with-animals.md), [locate object](/compendium/spells/locate-object.md), and [pass without trace](/compendium/spells/pass-without-trace.md). Once the amulet has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. |
| 4 | [Prying Blade](/compendium/items/prying-blade-xmts.md) |  | A hooked blade useful on board a ship or as a cutting tool in the wilderness, this +1 shortsword grants its wielder advantage on Strength ([Athletics](/rules/skills.md#Athletics)) checks to climb or to escape while [restrained](/rules/conditions.md#restrained). |
| 5 | [Sorcerous Spyglass](/compendium/items/sorcerous-spyglass-xmts.md) |  | This elegant brass [spyglass](/compendium/items/spyglass.md) features an intricate lens mechanism. A creature looking through the sorcerous spyglass has advantage on Wisdom ([Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception)) checks to detect things that can be seen. In addition, the user can view magical auras while looking through the spyglass, as if under the effect of a [detect magic](/compendium/spells/detect-magic.md) spell. |
| 6 | [Vanquisher's Banner](/compendium/items/vanquishers-banner-xmts.md) |  | This battle-worn but unbroken standard bears the insignia of one of the forces of the Legion of Dusk. A creature that holds the vanquisher's banner can use a bonus action to grant an ally advantage on the ally's next attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. |
