# Condition
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 363. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A condition is a temporary game state. The definition of a condition says how it affects its recipient, and various rules define how to end a condition. This glossary defines these conditions:

- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Blinded|Blinded]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Charmed|Charmed]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Deafened|Deafened]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Frightened|Frightened]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Grappled|Grappled]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Invisible|Invisible]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Paralyzed|Paralyzed]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Petrified|Petrified]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Prone|Prone]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Restrained|Restrained]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Stunned|Stunned]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Unconscious|Unconscious]]  

A condition doesn't stack with itself; a recipient either has a condition or doesn't. The [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] condition is an exception to that rule.

## Player-Facing Summary

Condition xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of condition xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around condition xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties condition xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at condition xphb to avert a public scandal.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
