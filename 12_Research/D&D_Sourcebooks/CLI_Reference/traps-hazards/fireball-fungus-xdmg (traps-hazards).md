--- # Fireball Fungus

*Generic Hazard* A fireball fungus is a Small, iimate mushroom that can grow anywhere fungi are found in abundance. Its luminous, orange cap sheds [[Light Xphb]] in a 15-foot radius and [[Light Xphb]] for an additional 15 feet. A fireball fungus has AC 10, HP 6, and [[immunity-xphb (variant-rules)]] to Psychic damage. When it drops to 0 Hit Points, the fungus explodes as if a [[fireball-xphb (spells)]] spell (save DC 15) had been centered on it. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## At Higher Levels The explosion of a fireball fungus causes other fireball fungi in the area of effect to explode as well. You can scale the hazard for higher levels by adding one additional fungus at levels 11â€“16 or three additional fungi at levels 17â€“20. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 76* ## Player-Facing Summary Fireball fungus xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
