# Despair (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (30-foot cone)

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
Each creature in a 30-foot cone must suc-ceed on a Wisdom saving throw or lapse into despondent depression as they realize the hopelessness and folly of their beliefs. An affected creature will sit down and brood or start crying uncontrollably. An affected creature may make a new saving throw at the start of each of its turns, but at disadvantage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
