|10 (+0)|10 (+0)|10 (+0)|10 (+0)|10 (+0)|10 (+0)| - **Damage Immunities** poison, psychic This item first appears to be a sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful **DC 20** Intelligence ([[skills#Investigation|Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster. To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus's hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside. The apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes``dice: 2d6``Bludgeoning damage each minute from pressure. A creature in the compartment can take a [actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action to move as many as two of the apparatus's levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of Kwalish Levers table. **Apparatus of Kwalish Levers** | Lever | Up | Down |
