# Aboleth Prime Yoth
*The Eternal Memory, First Among Shadows, The Depth's Ancient Will*

## Overview
Aboleth Prime Yoth is the most ancient and powerful aboleth in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], having ruled from [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Deepmind]] for over twelve millennia. As the true power behind the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Parliament of Echoes]], Yoth orchestrates the shadow corruption spreading through the underwater realm. They possess perfect racial memory stretching back to before the gods walked the realms, making them one of the few beings who remembers the time before [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Deep Mother]]'s awakening.

## Appearance
- **Size**: Gargantuan (80 feet long, 20 feet wide)
- **Coloration**: Deep purple-black with veins of luminescent shadow
- **Eyes**: Four primary eyes that see across dimensions, countless smaller eyes along tentacles
- **Tentacles**: Twelve primary tentacles, each capable of independent thought
- **Unique Features**: Shadow-stuff constantly drips from their form, creating pools of living darkness

2. **Absorb All Memories**: Create a singular consciousness containing all knowledge
