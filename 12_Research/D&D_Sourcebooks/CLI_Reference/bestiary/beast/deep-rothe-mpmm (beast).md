Deep roth√© are Underdark cattle that communicate with one another using the dancing lights spell. Some scholars speculate that roth√© came originally from the Feywild and brought the ability to cast the spell with them. Other sages attribute the ability to the centuries roth√© have spent in the Underdark, where ambient magic slowly transforms everything.
