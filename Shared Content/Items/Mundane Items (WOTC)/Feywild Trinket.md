## Description: 
The Feywild Trinkets table that follows offers a selection of trinkets appropriate for Feywild-themed adventures such as this one. Players whose characters have the feylost or Witchlight hand background can roll on this table instead of the Trinkets table in the Player's Handbook to determine what trinkets their characters possess. The adventure includes a few encounters that require you to roll on the table to determine what random trinkets the characters find in key locations.Feywild Trinketsd100Trinket01Cookie cutter shaped like a unicorn02Two yew rings linked together03Silver hand mirror with a nymph-shaped handle04Painted wooden key whose teeth change configuration every day at dawn05Delicate silver cameo with pictures of twin children opposite one another06Golden pendant charm shaped like a leprechaun07Tiny wooden box containing a croquet set sized for pixies or sprites08Tiny pair of sharp, iron scissors09Chess piece shaped like a dancing satyr wearing a bishop's hat and clutching a gnarled staff10Saltshaker shaped like a wizard's tower11Crystal orb that allows an elf who holds it to sleep12Pendant that shows the phases of the moon13Large iron fingernail14Tiny electrum whistle that only Fey can hear15Wooden jigsaw puzzle piece as big as a saucer, with a painted image of a jug on it16Spool of glistening silver thread17Sheet of music that goblins find upsetting when they hear it played or sung18Rotten ogre's tooth with the Elvish glyph for "moon" etched into it19Vitrified eye of a displacer beast20Tiny duskwood coffin containing the ashes of a troll21Old invitation to a banquet in the Summer Court, written in ink on vellum in Sylvan22Gossamer shawl that glows faintly in moonlight23Ball-and-cup toy that plays a short, victorious jingle whenever the ball lands in the cup24Sprite's skull covered in ink fingerprints25Silver fork with the outer tines bent sideways26A soot-stained sock in which a nugget of coal magically appears each day at dawn27Tiny wooden stool (sized for a pixie or sprite) that gives splinters to those who hold it28Tiny clockwork dragonfly that slowly beats its wings (but can't fly) when wound up29Toy unicorn made of wood, painted with bright colors30Pixie plushie that sings when you squeeze it311-inch-square painting of a sleeping elf32Thimble that helps you daydream when worn33Pumpkin cupcake that magically regenerates itself in its paper cup each day at dawn34Fake Three-Dragon Ante card depicting a faerie dragon35Teacup made from a varnished mushroom cap that magically keeps its liquid contents lukewarm36Rock that floats and is small enough to hide in your closed fist37Tiny bottle filled with rainwater collected from the Feywild38Opalescent conch shell that laughs when you hold it to your ear39Vial of viscous liquid labeled "Fomorian spit.
