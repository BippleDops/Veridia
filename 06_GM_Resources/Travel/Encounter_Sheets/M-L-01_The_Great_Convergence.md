# M-L-01 The Great Convergence

## Read-Aloud
> Horizons fold like paper. Cities appear where seas were; seas pour where skies stood. Your ship is a needle stitching two worlds.

## Setup
- Global event; multi-session resolution possible
- Stakes: Unify or shatter worlds

## Mechanics
- Anchorite DC 18 stabilize key nodes (3 successes between sessions)
- Command DC 18 coordinate fleets and relief
- Group Sanity DC 18 resist identity overlap

## Outcomes
- Success: Stable union (campaign reframe); pick union traits (law, travel, magic)
- Partial: Fragmented union (patchwork map); anchors required to traverse seams
- Fail: Catastrophic split; survival arc; draw map of fractures

## Integrations
- All core systems; update [[Master_Campaign_Index]] status and maps

## Quick-Run
- Run node skill challenges over scenes; track Integrity; set final state
