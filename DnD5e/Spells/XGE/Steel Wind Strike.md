# Steel Wind Strike
You flourish the weapon used in the casting and then vanish to strike like the wind. Choose up to five creatures you can see within range. Make a melee spell attack against each target. On a hit, a target takes `dice: 6d10|avg` (6d10) force damage.

You can then teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of one of the targets you hit or missed.
