--- # Feign Death

*3rd-level, Necromancy (ritual)* - **Casting time:** 1 Action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of graveyard dirt)
- **Duration:** 1 hour You touch a willing creature and put it into a cataleptic state that is indistinguishable from death. For the duration, the target appears dead to outward inspection and to spells used to determine the target's status. The target has the [[conditions#Blinded|Blinded and [conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] conditions, and its [[Fly Speed Xphb is 0. The target also has [boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats)]] to all damage except Psychic damage, and it has [[immunity-xphb (variant-rules) to the [conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition. **Classes**: [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 271* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Feign death xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of feign death xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around feign death xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Secret Covenant - Summon ancient evil ## Plot Hooks - The authorities needs help finding before the festival
