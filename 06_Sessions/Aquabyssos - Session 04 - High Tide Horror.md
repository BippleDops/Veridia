High tide triggers the [Shadow Harvest]] as hundreds of shadows converge on the [[Reflection Pools. The party discovers [Shadow Duchess]] Nyx fighting her own shadow for control while the [[Scattered Emperor contemplates reuniting his consciousness for one final act. The truth of the shadow conspiracy is revealed - not evil, but a desperate bid for independence that will cost original lives. ### [Opening Scene]]

**Location:** Party's quarters at high tide
**Time:** The moment of high tide
**Description:** Water in the [[Reflection Pools turns pitch black as hundreds of shadows converge. The party's own shadows begin pulling away, trying to join the mass gathering. Through the window, they see [Shadow Duchess]] Nyx at the center - but she's fighting AGAINST the ritual, battling her own shadow. **Mechanical:** STR save **DC 15** to hold onto own shadow, failure means it escapes for the scene. #### Event 1: Race to the Pools

**Location:** [[[Shadow Market Canals]]
**Challenge:** Navigate through shadow-possessed citizens
**Mechanics:**
- Stealth **DC 14** to avoid detection
- Persuasion **DC 16** to calm panicked citizens
- Athletics **DC 13** to navigate flooded passages **Discoveries:**
- Not all shadows are hostile
- Some shadows protecting their originals
- Mass confusion - nobody knows who's who #### Event 2: [[The Surgical [Theater Horror]]

**Location:** [[theater
**Scene:** Witness mass shadow transplant operations
**[Horror Elements]]:**
- Citizens paralyzed on operating tables
- Shadows performing precise surgical cuts
- Hybrid beings created from failed merges **[[Moral Dilemma:** Save citizens (alert all shadows) or remain hidden (let operations continue) #### Event 3: [The Two]] [[Duchess Confrontation

**Location:** Center of [Reflection Pools]]
**Revelation:** Nyx killed her shadow years ago - it came back stronger
**[[The Debate:**
- **[Original Nyx]]**: "I gave you death, you gave me fear"
- **[[Shadow Nyx**: "You killed me first, now we return the favor"
- **[Party Choice]]**: Support either, both, or neither **[[Mechanical Challenge:**
- Insight **DC 16** to detect truth in arguments
- Persuasion **DC 18** to propose compromise
- Combat if negotiations fail #### Event 4: [The Emperor]]'s Gambit

**Location:** [[[Convergence Point]]
**Situation:** [[The Emperor offers to reunite and stop the harvest
**Cost:** He will die permanently if reunited too long
**[Decision Tree]]:**
1. Accept sacrifice - Emperor stops harvest but dies
2. Refuse - Must find alternative solution
3. Partial - Emperor helps but harvest continues slowly
4. Creative - Player-proposed solution **Emperor's [[United Form:**

- Thousands of eels forming human shape
- All personalities speaking in harmony
- Electromagnetic pulse ability vs shadows
- 10 minutes before permanent death #### [Shadow Perspective]] Revealed

1. **[[Not Evil**: Shadows want independence, not destruction
2. **Centuries of Silence**: Conscious but voiceless for ages
3. **[Democratic Decision]]**: [[Shadow Parliament voted for harvest
4. **[Some Dissent]]**: Not all shadows agree with violence
5. **[[Original Sin**: Nyx's shadow murder started everything #### [The Three]]-[[Way Battle

**Phase 1: Disruption** (Rounds 1-3)
- Stop surgeries in progress
- Free paralyzed citizens
- [Protect Emperor]] during reunification **Phase 2: Negotiation** (Rounds 4-6)
- Duchess arguments heard
- Marina's shadow speaks for peace
- Party must choose stance **Phase 3: Resolution** (Rounds 7+)
- Implement chosen solution
- Deal with consequences
- Set stage for Act 2 #### [[Shadow Surgeons Collective

**Composition**: 5 [Shadow Surgeons]]
- **AS**: 16, **HP**: 52 each
- **[[Surgical Strike**: +8 to hit, `dice: 2d6`+4 damage
- **[Shadow Scalpel]]**: Separates shadow from body (CON **DC 15**)
- **[[Pack Tactics**: Advantage when flanking **Tactics**: Focus on separating party shadows, coordinate attacks #### [Hybrid Abominations]] (Optional)

**Composition**: 3 [[Failed Merges
- **AS**: 14, **HP**: 65 each
- **[Unstable Form]]**: Random ability each round
- **[[Death Burst**: `dice: 2d6` damage to adjacent on death
- **Pitiful**: Can be reasoned with (CHA **DC 16**) **Roleplay**: These were people - now in agony #### [The Shadow]] [[Duchess Battle

**[Shadow Nyx]]** (if combat occurs):
- **AS**: 18, **HP**: 120
- **[[Legendary Resistance**: 3/day
- **[Legendary Actions]]**: 2/round - [[Shadow Step (teleport 30 ft) - [Command Shadow]] (control one shadow) - [[Darkness Pulse (15 ft radius blind)
- **[Shadow Storm]]**: All shadows in 60 ft animate
- **Weakness**: True sunlight (none available) #### [[Items Gained

| Item | Source | Properties |
|------|--------|------------|
| [Shadow Lock]] Chains | [[Shadow Surgeons | Bind shadow to owner, 5 uses |
| Emperor's [Final Gift]] | Emperor (if sacrificed) | One-time electromagnetic pulse |
| Nyx's [[Shadow Blade | Nyx (either version) | +1 weapon, damages shadows |
| [Surgical Schedule]] | Theater | List of planned replacements | #### [[Moral Stance Declaration

Each player must declare their position:
1. **Pro-Original**: Shadows are threat to eliminate
2. **Pro-Shadow**: Shadows deserve freedom
3. **Neutrality**: Seek balance and coexistence
4. **Pragmatist**: Whatever ensures survival #### [The Cliffhanger]]

Whatever path chosen, as dawn approaches (impossible at this depth), a message arrives from [[Tenebrarum: > "[The Shadow]] Parliament has convened. The vote is uimous. > For the crime of existence denial, war is declared on all who cast shadows.

> [[The Deep Harvest begins across seven continents.
> You have three days to surrender or prepare.
> There will be no mercy for light-bearers." Marina (or her shadow) turns to the party: "We need to reach Tenebrarum before—" EXPLOSION. The [[[Pressure Tube]] Terminal]] detonates, trapping everyone in [[Abyssos Prime as shadow forces surround the city. The only way out is through shadow-controlled territory, and every person's shadow is now a potential enemy. ### [Initiative Order]]
