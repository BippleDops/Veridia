# Fireball Fungus
*Generic Hazard*  

A fireball fungus is a Small, iimate mushroom that can grow anywhere fungi are found in abundance. Its luminous, orange cap sheds [[Light Xphb]] in a 15-foot radius and [[Light Xphb]] for an additional 15 feet.

A fireball fungus has AC 10, HP 6, and [[immunity-xphb (variant-rules)]] to Psychic damage. When it drops to 0 Hit Points, the fungus explodes as if a [[fireball-xphb (spells)]] spell (save DC 15) had been centered on it.
