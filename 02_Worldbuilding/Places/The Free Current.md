## Secrets and Hidden Aspects

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Silent Partners
> Several major Free Current businesses are secretly funded by wealthy interests from other regions who want to see the libertarian experiment succeed. These "Silent Partners" provide capital and market access in exchange for information about Free Current innovations and proof that free markets can work. The arrangement benefits both sides but would be controversial if revealed, as some community members would see it as outside interference in their independence.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Underground Railroad
> The Free Current operates a secret network helping people escape from oppressive governments throughout Aquabyssos. This "Liberty Current" smuggles refugees, provides safe houses, and helps people establish new identities. The operation is entirely voluntary and funded by private donations, but it creates political tensions with neighboring governments and could provoke retaliation if fully exposed.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Contingency Plan
> Community leaders have secretly developed plans for completely abandoning the Free Current if it becomes impossible to maintain their independence. The "Deep Freedom Protocol" involves evacuating the entire population to prepared locations in the deepest parts of the ocean, where they could establish a new free community beyond the reach of any government. The plan includes hidden supply caches and escape routes, but would mean giving up everything they've built.
