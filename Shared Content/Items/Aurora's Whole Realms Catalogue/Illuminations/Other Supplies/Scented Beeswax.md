## Description
While the rich scent of honeyed [[Beeswax|beeswax]] always brings back memories to me of my childhood, others find the scent cloying or offensive. For people of discriminate taste, I have treated purest [[Beeswax|beeswax]] to eliminate all traces of honey and perfumed it with a selection of lighter, more pleasant scents (14 sp per pound). Available in cinnamon, patchouli, frankincense, sandalwood, myrrh, rose, lily of the valley, violet, oriental blend, peach, apple, [[Vanilla|vanilla]], and pine scents.
