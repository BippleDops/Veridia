## Special Traits
**Animate Plants (1/Day):** As an action, a shroom can magically animate plants within 50 feet of itself. The effect is identical to the animate objects spell, but only live plants can be animated and the duration is 24 hours.

**Awaken Plants (1/Month):** A shroom can magically awaken one plant it touches. The effect is identical to the awaken spell, but only live plants can be awakened.

**Toxic Flesh:** Any creature that tastes the flesh of a shroom must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. If the save succeeds, the creature detects the poison and spits out the morsel before any damage is done. If the save fails, the character is overwhelmed by the deliciousness of the shroom and immediately downs a mouthful, then continues eating in a normal manner until full or until someone stops him or her. An hour after consuming even one bite of shroom flesh, the eater is affected as if by a feeblemind spell. The effect of the toxin can actually turn out to be beneficial in the long run; there is a 5 percent chance that a character who recovers or is restored to sanity after being feebleminded by shroom flesh permanently gains 1 point of Intelligence from the experience. A character can gain this benefit only once.

**Spellcasting:** The shroom is an arcane and divine spellcaster that uses Intelligence as its spellcasting ability (DC 14, attack +6). It doesn’t need material components to cast spells. The spells listed below are suggestions; individual shrooms can have different spell selections.

- Cantrips (at will): *druidcraft, poison spray, thorn whip*

- 1st level (x4): *charm, detect magic, entangle, sleep, thunderwave*

- 2nd level (x3): *barkskin, enlarge/reduce, pass without trace, spike growth*

- 3rd level (x2): *plant growth, speak with plants, stinking cloud*

## Actions
**Slam:*** Melee Attack*: +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 3 (`dice: 1d6`) bludgeoning damage.

**Psychic Thrashing:** *Ranged Attack:* +6 to hit, range 100 ft., one creature. Hit: 15 (`dice: 2d10+4`) psychic damage and the target must make a successful DC 14 Intelligence saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Underground, temperate and warm forests

**Organization**: Solitary (but usually accompanied by 2–7 animated plants or charmed, feebleminded adventurers)

## Description
Shrooms are evil toadstool creatures with genius intellects and considerable magical power. They lurk in the deep places of the earth and in dank forests, plotting ruin against surface dwellers and scheming to gain power for themselves by any means possible. They are highly adept with magic that influences plants, and most of them are knowledgeable in various forms of arcane study of other kinds, such as alchemy. Many, too, will surround themselves with strange minions that they have created, grown, or bred.

Shrooms are highly individual and their schemes are wide-ranging, but always sinister. They can be gracious hosts, but they always want something in return for their hospitality. They are master manipulators; many adventurers have “stumbled upon” the lair of a shroom and been treated to an evening (or several days) of fine dining, engaging conversation, and whimsical entertainment, only to discover later that the shroom pre-arranged all of it—right down to their traveling through that area to begin with—because it wanted to enlist their unwitting aid in one of its intricate plots.

The flesh of a shroom is delectable but deadly. Shrooms have been known to slice off portions of their own bodies (painful, but it grows back) and feed these morsels to unsuspecting diners, then charm the feebleminded victims into acting as their bodyguards.

Although one might expect to find an affinity between shrooms and myconids, they are not natural allies. Shrooms have little patience for or understanding of the myconids’ spirituality and introspection. If myconids could be hammered into a conquering army, the situation might be different.
