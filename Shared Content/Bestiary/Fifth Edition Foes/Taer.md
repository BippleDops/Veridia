## Description
Taers are primitive, fur-covered humanoids that may be related to yetis. They resemble apelike, bestial, prehistoric ancestors of humans. Taers never wear clothing, although they do sometimes wear necklaces and bracelets made of tooth and horn. Their fur is coated with an oily, fatty substance that keeps out moisture and increases their fur’s insulation— very important advantages in the frigid, snowy environments where taers live.

Taers can see clearly even in heavy snowstorms thanks to a second, transparent eyelid that protects their eyes from icy wind and blowing snow.

Taers do not have a fully-developed verbal language; they communicate through grunts, hooting, and yelling, as well as with body language similar to that used by apes.

Taers attack by punching and biting. Rarely, they use heavy clubs or even stone-tipped spears in combat. Being both fearless and highly territorial, they attack any creature that wanders into their tundra. Taers use their knowledge of the land to great advantage during combat by creating avalanches, burrowing under the snow to set up ambushes, and digging pits in the snow and ice that are skillfully camouflaged with branches and snow to trap the unwary. Despite their ferociousness, taers prefer to drive away intruders rather than kill them.

Bands of taers are nomadic hunters and gatherers. They follow herds of game animals and ripening fruits and nuts across their harsh landscape. Though they do eat meat, taer do not hunt or eat humanoids. Taer are extremely superstitious. They have an irrational fear of metal and of clothing, and they also fear creatures that use metal weapons and wrap themselves in clothing. No taer will use metal weapons or tools or wear any sort of cloth.

Taer clans worship a snow god to whom they offer sacrifices (of food, which is precious in their world) for protection and guidance. Each clan has a stone idol of this snow god that is hidden somewhere in its territory, often near a warm spring, a sheltered valley, or a hidden cave.
