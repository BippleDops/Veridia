# Convergence Point Countdown

*The clock is ticking toward reality's merger*

## Overview

The Convergence Point Countdown is a dynamic campaign tracking system that monitors the approaching merger of Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. Rather than a fixed timeline, it responds to player actions, major events, and the passage of time. This tool helps GMs maintain tension, telegraph consequences, and ensure the campaign builds toward its climactic conclusion.
