Aquabyssos is a vast underwater realm created when a series of interconnected climatic catastrophes known as the "Century of Storms" (900-800 years ago) caused massive tsunamis, perpetual hurricanes, and reality-warping rainfall that literally pulled portions of the surface world beneath the waves. These weren't natural disasters but the result of a failed attempt to control weather magic on a continental scale. The survivors didn't simply adapt - transformed they the Drowning Embrace, a form of deep magic that allowed them to survive underwater at the cost of their humanity. Now, five centuries later, Aquabyssos is a haunting realm of drowned cities, transformed inhabitants, and powers that should have remained buried. Furthermore, ### The Century of Storms (900-800 years ago)

The surface empires of Thalassopolis, Nereidion, and Abyssal Mor attempted to end a devastating war by using weather control magic amplified by proto-crystals (predecessors to Aethermoor's [[The Seven Shards|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards). The ritual backfired catastrophically: 1. **Year 1-20**: Unnatural hurricanes that never dissipated
2. **Year 21-50**: Rain that fell upward, pulling land into the sky before dropping it into the sea
3. **Year 51-75**: Tsunamis that moved against natural law, flowing inland and refusing to recede
4. **Year 76-99**: The Sea's Hunger - water that actively sought to drown land
5. **Year 100**: The Final Submersion - gravitational reversal that pulled three continents beneath the waves ### The Drowning Embrace

As millions faced death by drowning, desperate mages made pacts with Things That Dwell Beneath - ancient entities that existed before light. The survivors were transformed:
- Lungs that process water and air
- Pressure-resistant bodies
- Ability to see in absolute darkness
- Connection to the Depth Whispers (collective unconscious)
- Gradual loss of surface memories and emotions #### The Twilight Depth (0-500 fathoms)

Where sunlight still penetrates weakly, creating an eternal twilight. Most "civilized" settlements exist here:
- **New Thalassopolis**: Capital city built in/around the drowned surface capital
- **The Kelp Forests**: Vast underwater forests hiding ancient ruins
- **The Breach Points**: Where Aquabyssos connects to surface waters #### The Midnight Depth (500-2000 fathoms)

Absolute darkness where bioluminescence and magic provide only light:
- **The Obsidian Palace**: Seat of the Depth Sovereign
- **The Bone Trenches**: Mass graves become underwater canyons
- **Cities of Silence**: Settlements where speaking is forbidden #### The Hadean Depth (2000+ fathoms)

Where reality breaks down and the Things That Dwell Beneath stir:
- **The Wound**: A tear in reality from the original catastrophe
- **Dream Corpus**: City-sized sleeping entity
- **The Foundation**: Where the ocean floor doesn't exist #### The Drowned Gardens

Once the breadbasket of the surface world, now vast underwater plains where:
- Kelp farms stretch for miles
- Sunken villages dot the landscape like tombstones
- Depth Farmers harvest memories from drowned soil
- Ghost crops grow that only the transformed can eat #### The Inverted Mountains

Mountain ranges that were flipped upside down during the Drowning:
- Peaks point toward the oceanic abyss
- Underwater avalanches fall upward
- Gravity works inconsistently
- Mining operations extract "void minerals" #### The Coral Throne

A massive reef growing from the bodies of millions who drowned:
- Each coral formation contains preserved consciousness
- Whispers prophecies and memories
- Slowly expanding toward the surface
- Center of necromantic deep magic #### The Depth Sovereign

Currently **Empress Tethys the Ever-Drowning**:
- Rules from the Obsidian Palace
- Dies and drowns every dawn, resurrects every dusk
- Memories reset partially each time
- Over 400 years old, remembers the surface in fragments #### The Tidal Council

Seven transformed nobles who each control an aspect:
1. **The Pressure Lord**: Military and defense
2. **The Current Keeper**: Trade and movement
3. **The Memory Harvester**: History and education
4. **The Depth Speaker**: Religion and philosophy
5. **The Coral Tender**: Agriculture and resources
6. **The Void Watcher**: Exploration and Hadean relations
7. **The Surface Liaison**: Diplomacy with above ([Ambassador Korvin Blacktide|02 Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Korvin Blacktide]]) ### Religion: The Church of Drowning Truths Core beliefs:

- The surface world is a lie that must be drowned
- Transformation is evolution, not corruption
- Memory is currency that should be spent
- The Things That Dwell Beneath will rise when all is drowned
- Death by drowning is the only true death High Priests can:
- Breathe memories into water
- Transform surface dwellers instantly
- Commune with the Things That Dwell Beneath
- Navigate the Hadean Depth safely #### Hydromancy Supreme

Not mere water control but reality manipulation through water:
- Create solid water constructs
- Drown concepts (forget completely)
- Breathe life into drowned things
- Transform matter to liquid temporarily #### Pressure Sorcery

Using oceanic pressure as a weapon and tool:
- Crush objects or beings at range
- Create pressure barriers
- Compress space itself
- Implode magic from within #### Depth Necromancy

Death has different rules underwater:
- Drowned dead retain consciousness
- Corpses become coral become undead
- Memory extraction from the deceased
- Speaking with deaths that haven't happened yet #### Void Swimming

Navigation and manipulation of spaces that shouldn't exist:
- Travel through solid matter via water
- Access the Hadean Depth safely
- Hide in spaces between spaces
- Summon things from nowhere ### The Resurgent Tide

**Goal**: Complete the Great Drowning, submerge all surface lands
**Leader**: High Priestess Scylla Voidsworn
**Methods**: Terrorism, weather manipulation, infiltration
**Belief**: Surface world is an abomination that must be cleansed ### The Preservation Current

**Goal**: Maintain separation between surface and depths
**Leader**: Lord Admiral Pelagios Clearwater
**Methods**: Diplomacy, controlled trade, information management
**Belief**: Both worlds can coexist if carefully managed ### The Deep Dreamers

**Goal**: Awaken the Things That Dwell Beneath
**Leader**: The Whisper Choir (collective consciousness)
**Methods**: Ritual sacrifice, memory harvesting, reality manipulation
**Belief**: Current existence is a dream; awakening brings truth ### The Surface Seekers

**Goal**: Reverse transformation, return to surface life
**Leader**: Doctor Marius Lastbreath
**Methods**: Magical research, alchemy, forbidden experimentation
**Belief**: The Drowning Embrace can be broken ### The Void Touched

**Goal**: Explore and colonize the Hadean Depth
**Leader**: Explorer-Prophet **Methods**: Transformation acceleration, void swimming, madness embrace
**Belief**: Evolution requires descending deeper ### The Thirteen Mysteries 1. **The Sleeping City**: An entire city that phases in and out of existence

2. **The Last Breath**: A bubble of air that has survived since the Drowning
3. **The Inverse Rain**: Water that falls upward in certain areas
4. **The Memory Merchant**: Trades memories that haven't been formed yet
5. **The Depth Clock**: Massive mechanism counting down to unknown event
6. **The Surface Reflection**: Mirror images of surface cities that appear in depths
7. **The Drowning Song**: Melody that causes voluntary transformation
8. **The Pressure Prophet**: Predicts future through pressure changes
9. **The Coral Crown**: Artifact that controls all transformed minds
10. **The Depth Seeds**: Objects that cause localized drowning on surface
11. **The Void Letters**: Messages from beyond the Hadean Depth
12. **The Breathing Stone**: Artifact that reverses transformation
13. **The Original Sin**: True cause of the Century of Storms ### Hidden Truths > [!danger] The Things That Dwell Beneath

> These aren't gods or demons but the universe's immune system. The surface world is an infection, and the Drowning was the first attempt at cleansing. They're patient, immortal, and view humanity as bacteria to be processed or purged. > [!warning] The Connection to Aethermoor
> The [[The Seven Shards|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]] of Aethermoor are fragments of the same proto-crystal that caused the Great Drowning. If reunited underwater, they could complete the Drowning and submerge all surface lands permanently. > [!info] The Empress's Secret
> Empress Tethys isn't dying and resurrecting daily - she's splitting into multiple versions. There are now dozens of her at different depths, each with different memories and goals. They're planning something that requires all versions to reunite. ### Potential Futures

1. **War of Depths**: Open conflict between realms
2. **Forced Unity**: Alliance against greater threat
3. **The Second Drowning**: Aquabyssos succeeds in submerging Aethermoor
4. **Synthesis**: Merger of crystal and depth magic creates new horror
5. **Mutual Destruction**: Both realms fall to their respective corruptions ## Player-Facing Summary Aquabyssos World Overview is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Aquabyssos World Overview as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Aquabyssos World Overview. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## References - [[Cult of Screams (Cults_and_Movements)
