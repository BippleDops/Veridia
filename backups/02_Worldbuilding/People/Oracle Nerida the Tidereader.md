# Oracle Nerida the Tidereader
*Seer of the Depths, Voice of Future Tides*

## Overview
Oracle Nerida the Tidereader serves as Aquabyssos's most trusted divination specialist, offering prophetic insights to anyone who seeks guidanceâ€”from humble fishermen to high-ranking government officials. Her unique connection to the tidal forces of the realm allows her to read the future through the eternal dance of water, providing cryptic but accurate visions of what is to come. Neither aligned with any faction nor bound by political considerations, she remains a neutral oracle whose loyalty lies with truth itself.
