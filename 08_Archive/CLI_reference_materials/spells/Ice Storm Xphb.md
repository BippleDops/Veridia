# Ice Storm
*4th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a mitten)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Hail falls in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [Cylinder](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on a point within range. Each creature in the [Cylinder](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md) makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `2d10` Bludgeoning damage and `4d6` Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Hailstones turn ground in the [Cylinder](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md) into [Difficult Terrain](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md) until the end of your next turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The Bludgeoning damage increases by `d10` for each spell slot level above 4.

**Classes**: [Druid](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Cleric (Tempest Domain)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-tempest-domain.md "class=XPHB"); [Druid (Circle of the Land)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-circle-of-the-land-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard (Evoker)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-evoker-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Druid (Circle of the Sea)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-circle-of-the-sea-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md); [Paladin (Oath of the Ancients)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-the-ancients-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB")
