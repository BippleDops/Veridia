# The Hadal Depths
*Where Reality Drowns, The Mother's Cradle, The Final Deep*

## Overview
The Hadal Depths represent the absolute bottom of [[Aquabyssos]], where water becomes something else entirely and the laws of physics surrender to older truths. Here, at depths exceeding 20,000 feet, the [[Deep Mother]] slumbers in her eternal dream, her massive form comprising entire mountain ranges and trenches. This is where existence becomes negotiable, where pressure transforms matter into thought, and where even [[Aboleth Prime Yoth]] fears to venture.

## Geography of Impossibility

### Depth Zones

#### The Hadal Threshold (20,000-25,000 feet)
**The Last Boundary**
- Water becomes viscous, more like liquid space
- Light doesn't just fade—it's actively consumed
- Pressure: Instant death for unprepared (DC 30 CON)
- Time dilation: 1 hour = 1 day surface time
- First whispers of the Mother's dreams

#### The Dreaming Deep (25,000-30,000 feet)
**Where Dreams Become Real**
- Physical laws become suggestions
- Thoughts manifest as temporary entities
- Geography shifts with the Mother's sleep cycles
- Living mountains that are her coiled body
- Memory becomes physical substance

#### The Primary Trench (30,000-36,000 feet)
**The Mother's Rest**
- The Deep Mother's primary form location
- Reality completely malleable
- Non-Euclidean geometry standard
- Multiple dimensions overlap
- Origin point of all water

#### The Void Beneath (36,000+ feet)
**What Lies Under Dreams**
- Not truly "depth" anymore
- May connect to space between stars
- Where deleted realities go
- Even the Mother fears this
- [REDACTED BY REALITY]
