--- # Second Chance

*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 75* **Prerequisite**: [[Halfling Xphb]] Fortune favors you when someone tries to strike you. You gain the following benefits: - Increase your Dexterity, Constitution, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20. - When a creature you can see hits you with an attack roll, you can use your reaction to force that creature to reroll. Once you use this ability, you can't use it again until you roll initiative at the start of combat or until you finish a short or long rest. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Second chance xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
