# The Green Death

*When the cure becomes worse than the disease*

## Quest Overview
[[Sorrow-Root Nightbloom|02 Worldbuilding/People/Sorrow Root Nightbloom]] has completed their fungal weapon designed to kill anyone exposed to crystal corruption. With 90% of Aethermoor's population having some crystal exposure, this represents genocide. The party must navigate the dangerous [[The Synthesis Gardens|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Synthesis Gardens]], stop the weapon's deployment, and decide whether Sorrow-Root is villain or inadvertent savior.

## Quest Giver
**[[Archdruid Thornweaver|02 Worldbuilding/People/Archdruid Thornweaver]]** desperately seeks help after several of his druids were corrupted attempting to stop their former colleague. Alternatively, **[[Sir Marcus Dawnforge|02 Worldbuilding/People/Sir Marcus Dawnforge]]** receives intelligence about the threat through his underground network.

## Background
Sorrow-Root's research has uncovered a terrible truth: the [[Aether Crystals]] aren't just corrupting magic stones - they're eggs of an extraplanar parasite. The Green Death might be the only way to stop a worse catastrophe, but at the cost of nearly everyone in Aethermoor.

## Objectives

### Primary Objectives
1. Infiltrate [[The Synthesis Gardens|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Synthesis Gardens]]
2. Stop or delay the Green Death deployment
3. Discover the truth about the crystal parasites
4. Make the impossible choice: genocide or potential extinction

### Optional Objectives
- Rescue corrupted druids from the Withered Court
- Steal the corruption cure (Batch 7-Alpha)
- Turn Sorrow-Root from their path
- Find alternative solution to the parasite threat
- Secure research data about crystal origins

## Key NPCs Involved
- **[[Sorrow-Root Nightbloom|02 Worldbuilding/People/Sorrow Root Nightbloom]]** - Primary antagonist with valid concerns
- **[[Archdruid Thornweaver|02 Worldbuilding/People/Archdruid Thornweaver]]** - Desperate to save both nature and people
- **[[Ambassador Korvin Blacktide|02 Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Korvin Blacktide]]** - Secretly funding research for his own purposes
- **[[Zephyr Goldwhisper|02 Worldbuilding/People/Zephyr Goldwhisper]]** - Has Confederate resources that might help
- **[[High Inquisitor Maltheos|02 Worldbuilding/People/High Inquisitor Maltheos]]** - May temporarily ally against this threat
- **[[The Crimson Sage|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]]** - Knows the truth about the crystals

## Investigation Discoveries

### The Parasite Truth
Through Sorrow-Root's research notes, the party learns:
- Crystals are indeed eggs that will hatch in 2-3 years
- The parasites feed on life force and magic
- Each infected person becomes an incubator
- [[The Crimson Sage|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]] (Aetheron) has been trying to prevent this

### The Green Death Mechanism
- Fungal spores that target crystal-corrupted tissue
- Spreads through air and water
- Kills in 48 hours
- No known cure once infected
- Already produced in massive quantities

### Alternative Solutions
Hidden in the research:
- Batch 7-Alpha can reverse corruption if mass-produced
- [[Goldspire Port|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Goldspire Port]]'s null technology might destroy eggs
- The [[The Seven Shards|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]] united might purge all corruption
- [[Aquabyssos]] magic could transform people to survive

## Paths Through the Gardens

### The Direct Assault
- Fight through Withered Court defenses
- Battle corrupted nature itself
- Face Sorrow-Root in the Heart Root
- Risk: High casualties, Gardens' defenses activate

### The Infiltration Route
- Pose as recruits to the Withered Court
- Gain access to inner sanctum
- Sabotage from within
- Risk: Corruption exposure, moral compromises

### The Negotiation Path
- Appeal to Sorrow-Root's remaining humanity
- Present alternative solutions
- Seek compromise or delay
- Risk: May be too late, Sorrow-Root too far gone

### The Alliance Option
- Unite unlikely allies against threat
- Bring [[High Inquisitor Maltheos|02 Worldbuilding/People/High Inquisitor Maltheos]] and [[Archdruid Thornweaver|02 Worldbuilding/People/Archdruid Thornweaver]] together
- Coordinate multi-pronged approach
- Risk: Alliance instability, conflicting goals

## Moral Dilemmas

### The Trolley Problem
- Let Green Death deploy: Save world from parasites, kill 90% of population
- Stop Green Death: Save population, risk parasite apocalypse
- Partial deployment: Target specific infected areas only

### The Corruption Choice
- Use Batch 7-Alpha: Cure exists but limited supply - who gets saved?
- Embrace corruption: Some might survive transformation
- Seek Aquabyssos solution: Underwater transformation for survival

## DM Secrets
> [!warning] The Countdown
> - Deployment scheduled in 5 days
> - Each day, Sorrow-Root corrupts 1 square mile more of forest
> - Withered Court grows by 10 members daily
> - Confederate forces move closer to quarantine positions

> [!danger] The Real Horror
> Sorrow-Root is RIGHT. The crystals will hatch, and the parasites will consume all life. The Green Death, horrible as it is, might be the only solution that saves any life on Aethermoor.

> [!info] The Hidden Hope
> The secret garden with Sorrow-Root's last uncorrupted tree is the key to their humanity. If the tree is protected and shown that nature can survive without genocide, Sorrow-Root might relent.

## Consequences & Follow-ups

## Lore Details

Legends speak of The Green Death as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Green Death.

## Adventure Hooks

- An NPC seeks discreet help at The Green Death to avert a public scandal.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
