## Description
In the absence of a priest or paladin, party members will pour just about anything down an open wound. Our balm kit is constructed in Scornubel and weighs only 3 pounds. It contains many well-known salves: lemon juice (8 oz), lotus-blossom nectar (8 oz), onion juice (3 oz), [[Glue|pitch]] (8 oz), sea salt (8 oz), snake dung (2 oz), [[Tea|tea]] leaves (4 oz), vinegar (8 oz), and wood alcohol (7 cp/5 oz vial). (10 gp)

## Additional Details
wood alcohol adds 1 hit point; lotus-blossom nectar, [[Glue|pitch]], [[Tea|tea]] leaves, and vinegar have no effect; lemon juice, onion juice, sea salt, and snake dung subtract 1 hit point
