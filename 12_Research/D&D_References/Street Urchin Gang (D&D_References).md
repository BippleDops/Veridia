## Overview
A resourceful band of homeless children and teenagers who survive on the streets of Aquabyssos through theft, information trading, and minor criminal activities. Led by streetwise youth, they operate in the city's forgotten corners and abandoned structures.

Despite their criminal activities, the gang maintains a strict code against serious violence and often helps other street children survive in the harsh underwater city.

## Organization
**Leadership**: Rotating council of oldest members
**Structure**: Small cells of 3-5 children per group
**Territory**: Lower Harbor District and abandoned kelp farms
**Code**: No killing, protect younger members, share resources

## Territory
**Base**: Hidden chambers in abandoned kelp processing plant
**Operating Areas**: Harbor District markets, tourist areas, wealthy neighborhoods
**Safe Houses**: Multiple small hideouts throughout lower city

## Adventure Hooks
1. Gang witnesses major crime, needs protection to testify
2. Player characters hire them for information gathering
3. City crackdown forces them to seek temporary sanctuary

## DM Notes
Use this gang to add moral complexity - they're criminals but sympathetic. They can serve as both obstacles and allies depending on party actions and needs.
