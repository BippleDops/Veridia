# The Depth Chart
*Comprehensive Underwater Navigation and Mapping System*

> *"The Depth Chart doesn't just show where you are—it reveals the hidden geography of the deep, the safe passages through crushing pressures, and the secret routes that keep Aquabyssos connected. Navigation in the depths is a matter of life and death."*
> — [[Master Cartographer Current Deepmap]], Director of Underwater Navigation Services

## Overview

The Depth Chart represents the most advanced underwater navigation and mapping system ever developed, combining magical survey technology, pressure-sensitive cartography, real-time depth monitoring, and comprehensive safety information to enable safe navigation throughout the waters surrounding [[Aquabyssos]]. This sophisticated system provides critical information for everything from daily commuting to deep-sea exploration and emergency rescue operations.

The system integrates closely with the [[Pressure Adaptation System]] to provide navigation information tailored to individual pressure tolerance levels, while coordinating with [[Pressure Tubes]] to optimize transportation routes. Advanced magical algorithms continuously update depth information based on current conditions, geological changes, and safety assessments.

Developed through centuries of underwater exploration and mapping expeditions, the Depth Chart combines traditional cartographic methods with cutting-edge magical surveying techniques. The system serves not just as navigation aid but as comprehensive safety resource, providing critical information about pressure zones, hazardous areas, emergency shelter locations, and rescue coordination.

Recent technological advances have expanded the system to include inter-dimensional navigation capabilities for travel to [[Aethermoor]], real-time hazard detection, and integration with [[Crystal-Corruption-Tracking-Sheet]] systems for navigational safety warnings.
