# Icon of Ravenloft
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature of good alignment)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/icon-of-ravenloft.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 10.0 lbs.

The Icon of Ravenloft is a 12-inch tall statuette made of the purest silver, weighing 10 pounds. It depicts a cleric kneeling in supplication.

The icon was given to Strahd by the archpriest Ciril Romulich, an old family friend, to consecrate the castle and its chapel.

While within 30 feet of the icon, a creature is under the effect of a [[Protection From Evil and Good Xphb]] spell against fiends and undead. Only a creature attuned to the icon can use its other properties.
