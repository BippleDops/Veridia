## Overview
High Priestess Celeste Dawnbringer leads the Church of the Luminous Dawn in [[Crystalhaven]], serving as the kingdom's highest religious authority and primary divine healer.

### The Queen's Treatments
Every three days, in the hidden sanctuary beneath the cathedral, Celeste performs intensive healing sessions on [[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]] to slow the progression of her crystal corruption.

### The Hidden Toll
Each treatment session drains Celeste significantly:
- Loses 1d4 months of natural lifespan per major healing session
- Experiences increasing difficulty maintaining her own divine connection
- Suffers psychosomatic symptoms that mirror the queen's condition
- Growing dependence on the very crystal magic she's trying to cure

### Experimental Techniques
Celeste has developed several innovative approaches to treating crystal corruption:

**Solar Resoce Therapy**
- Uses concentrated sunlight channeled through blessed crystals
- Creates temporary immunity to corruption effects
- Requires rare components and perfect weather conditions
- Side effect: Patients develop light sensitivity

**Divine Essence Transfusion**
- Direct transfer of Celeste's own divine energy to patients
- Most effective treatment but extremely dangerous to caster
- Can cure early-stage corruption completely
- Risk: Could kill Celeste if overused

**Memory Palace Technique**
- Helps patients compartmentalize corruption-related trauma
- Allows them to function normally despite ongoing physical effects
- Requires ongoing maintece sessions
- Danger: Suppressed memories could resurface violently

**Crystal Harmony Ritual**
- Attempts to "purify" corrupted crystals rather than destroy them
- Theoretical breakthrough that could revolutionize treatment
- Still in experimental phase with mixed results
- Opposition: [[High Inquisitor Maltheos]] would execute her if he knew

### Research Facilities
**The Hidden Sanctuary**
- Secret chamber beneath the cathedral accessible only to Sacred Keepers
- Contains the queen's medical records and treatment equipment
- Protected by layers of divine wards and misdirection magic
- Houses experimental corruption specimens for study

**The Light Laboratory**
- Disguised as a meditation chamber in the cathedral's upper levels
- Where Celeste develops and tests new healing techniques
- Contains dangerous experimental equipment and forbidden texts
- Regularly inspected by church hierarchy who remain oblivious to its true purpose

### The Church Hierarchy
Celeste must navigate complex relationships within her own organization:

**Cardinal Vincent Goldspire** - Northern dioceses leader who suspects her of heretical research
**Archbishop Helena Dawnfire** - Traditional conservative who opposes any deviation from orthodox healing
**Bishop Marcus Sunblade** - Military chaplain who could become powerful ally or dangerous enemy

### Government Relations
**[[Lord Commander Gareth Steelborn]]** - Knows something is wrong with the queen but hasn't confronted Celeste
**Royal Council Members** - Several are growing suspicious of the queen's inconsistent public appearances
**Parliament Leaders** - Some want to use any royal weakness for political advantage

### International Implications
**Foreign Ambassadors** - Have noticed changes in the queen's behavior and appearance
**Church Officials from Other Realms** - Could expose the conspiracy if they discover the truth
**Healing Orders Abroad** - Celeste maintains correspondence seeking cures, risking exposure

## Expanded Combat Statistics
*Medium humanoid (human), lawful good*

**Additional Abilities:**
**Desperate Healing (1/Day).** When an ally drops to 0 hit points, Celeste can immediately teleport to them and cast *heal* as a reaction, but takes 2d6 necrotic damage.

**Divine Sacrifice.** Celeste can choose to take damage intended for another creature within 30 feet. She has resistance to this damage but cannot reduce it below 1.

**Corruption Cleansing (3/Day).** Touch attack that removes crystal corruption effects. Target makes DC 18 Constitution save; success removes one corruption level, failure deals 4d8 radiant damage.

**Light Form (1/Day).** Celeste becomes a being of pure light for 1 minute. She gains flying speed 60 ft., immunity to physical damage, and all healing spells are maximized.

### Psychological Impact
The constant deception is taking a severe psychological toll on Celeste:

**Stress Symptoms:**
- Insomnia and recurring nightmares about the queen's death
- Increasing reliance on divine magic to function normally
- Difficulty maintaining her public persona of serene confidence
- Growing paranoia about discovery and its consequences

**Spiritual Crisis:**
- Questions whether her deception violates her sacred oaths
- Wonders if she's enabling the queen's descent into corruption
- Fears that her lies have contaminated her connection to divine power
- Struggles with the possibility that letting the queen die might be merciful

**Relationship Strain:**
- Cannot form genuine connections due to constant secret-keeping
- Feels isolated even among her closest allies
- Battles resentment toward the queen for putting her in this position
- Questions whether her sacrifice will ultimately matter

### The Breaking Point
Celeste is approaching a psychological crisis that could manifest in several ways:
- Complete mental breakdown that exposes all secrets
- Desperate attempt to find permanent cure regardless of consequences
- Decision to publicly confess and accept execution
- Transformation into zealot willing to kill to protect secrets

## Adventure Hooks - Expanded
1. **The Corruption Crisis**: New form of corruption appears that her treatments can't touch
2. **The Suspicious Investigator**: Church authority arrives to examine her research methods  
3. **The Cure Component**: Rare material needed for breakthrough cure is in dangerous location

5. **The Moral Test**: Party must decide whether to help or expose her conspiracy
6. **The Successor Crisis**: Celeste's failing health requires training replacement who can be trusted
7. **The Divine Vision**: Religious experience suggests her methods are fundamentally flawed
8. **The Political Manipulation**: Enemy faction tries to use knowledge of conspiracy for leverage
9. **The International Incident**: Foreign healing expert discovers inconsistencies in queen's condition
10. **The Ultimate Choice**: Final decision between saving queen and saving kingdom
