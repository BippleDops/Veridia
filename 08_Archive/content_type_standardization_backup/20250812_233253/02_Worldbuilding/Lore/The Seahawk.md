# The Seahawk

![The Seahawk Portrait](04_Resources/Assets/Art/Lore/The_Seahawk.png)

## Summary
The Seahawk describes a turning current in history where choices about memory, depth, and sovereignty reshaped travel, trade, and ritual.

## Historical Context
- Origin: Scribal disputes escalated into pressure-lock conflicts.
- Spread: Merchant routes adopted secret signs to bypass tariffs; songs encoded depth-keys.
- Present: Competing narratives justify new taxes, oaths, and contraband routes.

## What It Means at the Table
- Investigation: On a lead toward old tariffs, players can extract schedules that reduce travel risks for a session.
- Social: Reciting the chapel oath grants advantage on one Persuasion check if honored afterward.
- Exploration: Recognizing encoded waystones reduces the chance of getting lost by one step.

## Threads and Revelations

- A rite echoes the activation cadence needed for [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/The Whispering Expanse.md|The Whispering Expanse]].
- Testimony suggests [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Elena Starweaver.md|Elena Starweaver]] financed a pivotal bribe.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of The Seahawk as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Seahawk.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties The Seahawk to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at The Seahawk to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to The Seahawk active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
