--- # Difficult Terrain

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 366. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* If a space is Difficult Terrain, every foot of movement in that space costs 1 extra foot. For example, moving 5 feet through Difficult Terrain costs 10 feet of movement. Difficult Terrain isn't cumulative; either a space is Difficult Terrain or it isn't. A space is Difficult Terrain if the space contains any of the following or something similar: - A creature that isn't Tiny or your ally - Furniture that is sized for creatures of your size or larger - Heavy snow, ice, rubble, or undergrowth - Liquid that's between shin- and waist-deep - A narrow opening sized for a creature one size smaller than you - A slope of 20 degrees or more ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Difficult terrain xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of difficult terrain xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around difficult terrain xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Alliance - Achieve immortality ## Plot Hooks - A document has gone missing and evil awakens
