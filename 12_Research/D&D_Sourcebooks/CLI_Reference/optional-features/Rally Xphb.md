# Rally
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 95*  

As a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]], you can expend one Superiority Die to bolster the resolve of a companion. Choose an ally of yours within 30 feet of yourself who can see or hear you. That creature gains [[temporary-hit-points-xphb|Temporary Hit Points]] equal to the Superiority Die roll plus half your Fighter level (round down).

## Player-Facing Summary

Rally xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of rally xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around rally xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- An NPC seeks discreet help at rally xphb to avert a public scandal.
