- **Habitat.** Desert, Forest, Planar (Upper Planes)  
- **Treasure.** Relics  

Guardian nagas are immortal, serpentine scholars that possess perfect memories. They collect the histories and lore of those they live among, guarding cultures' stories and passing them on to new generations with infallible accuracy. Guardian nagas that outlive their host civilizations might linger in whatever ruins remain, preserving the civilizations' stories so their lost people might live on.

Roll on or choose a result from the Guardian Naga Lore table to inspire what a naga knows.
