*[[Pleistocene Animal, Hyaenodon|Pleistocene animals]], also known as megafauna, are from a time just prior to recorded history.*

## Special Traits
**Wounded Fury:** While a brontotherium's hit points are below half of its starting number, the brontotherium has tactical advantage on attack rolls, the DC to avoid its trample increases to 19, and it rerolls all 1s, 2s, and 3s rolled on its damage dice.

**Trample:** As the brontotherium moves, it can enter spaces occupied by enemies up to Large size. Creatures in spaces the brontotherium enters can attempt DC 17 Dexterity saving throws. On a failed save, the creature takes 17 (`dice: 2d10+ 6`) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone; on a successful save, the creature moves 5 feet out of the brontotherium's path and can make an opportunity attack if it's allowed to react. A brontotherium can attempt to trample any number of creatures during its move, but it can't trample the same creature more than once per round and it can't end its movement in another creature's space.

**Gore:** *Melee Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 17 (`dice: 2d10+6`) piercing damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate

## Description
Brontotheriums (also called thunder beasts by some primitive tribes) are found on lost continents and large islands far from civilization. They dwell in primeval forests bordering broad plains where there is plenty of vegetation for these herbivores to feast on. They generally forage at night, in the early morning hours, or early evening hours so as to avoid the midday heat.

Herds are highly territorial and tend to keep to themselves. Occasionaly, they clash with other herds of their kind, except on mutual common ground (water holes, foraging areas, and so on). When two herds meet on ground that both consider theirs, the males quickly charge, butting heads and goring with their horns in an attempt to force the other herd to leave the area.

A brontotherium is about 14 feet long and stands eight feet tall at the shoulder. Its fur is dark brown or grayish-brown. When a herd is in danger, they charge, tearing up everything in their path and trampling any creatures that stand in their way.
