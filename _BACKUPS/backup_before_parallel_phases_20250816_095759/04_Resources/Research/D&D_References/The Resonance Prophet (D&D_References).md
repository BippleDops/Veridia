--- > [!figure] Portrait ## üîß Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Voice of the Singers Beyond > *"I don't hear the music‚ÄîI AM the music. And soon, you will be too."* ## üé≠ Appearance

A humanoid figure made entirely of living crystal that constantly shifts between different formations. Their body refracts light into rainbow patterns, and when they move, they create harmonic tones. Their face is a smooth crystal surface that shows reflections of whoever looks at them, but distorted to show their "true harmonic nature." ## ‚öîÔ∏è Statistics

**AC**: 19 (Crystalline Form) **HP**: 150 (`dice: 14d8` + 70) **Speed**: 30 ft, can phase through crystal at full speed **Proficiency Bonus**: +5 ### Multiattack

The Prophet uses Resoce Cascade and then makes two Harmonic Strike attacks. ### Attacks

**Harmonic Strike**: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft, `dice: 2d8`+2 bludgeoning plus `dice: 2d6` thunder damage. Target must make **DC 18** CON save or be deafened for 1 minute. **Resoce Cascade** (Recharge 5-6): All creatures within 30 ft must make **DC 18** WIS save or begin harmonizing. Harmonizing creatures:
- Share surface thoughts with all other harmonizing creatures
- Take `dice: 2d6` psychic damage if they lie
- Have disadvantage on saves against Prophet's abilities ### Legendary Resistance (3/Day)

If the Prophet fails a saving throw, they can choose to succeed instead. #### Harmonic Shield

First attack each round automatically misses as sound deflects it. #### Crystal Form Shatter

When reduced to 0 HP, explodes in crystal shards (`dice: 6d6` piercing, 20 ft radius, DEX **DC 18** for half) then reforms in `dice: 1d4` rounds at half HP (once per day). #### Singer Communication

Can communicate with the Singers Beyond, receiving visions and instructions. During communication, reality warps within 100 ft. #### Forced Harmonization

Creatures that spend 1 hour within 100 ft must make **DC 16** WIS save or begin harmonizing with the collective consciousness. ## üéØ Motivations & Goals

1. **Establish communication with Singers Beyond**
2. **Transform all consciousness into harmonic collective**
3. **Eliminate all sources of dissoce**
4. **Prepare reality for Singer arrival** ## üìä Scaling Options

- **Lower Level**: Reduce HP to 120, remove some Legendary Actions
- **Higher Level**: Add area harmonization effects, increase DCs
- **Mythic**: Can summon Singer fragment for aid --- *"Listen... Can you hear it? The Singers are teaching us a new song. When you learn the words, you'll never want to speak again."* ## Player-Facing Summary The Resoce Prophet is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Resoce Prophet as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens‚Äîshifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind‚Äîthat herald change around The Resoce Prophet. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Hidden Prophecy of Winds ## Plot Hooks - Someone is protecting information for revenge

- Strange sightings suggest ancient magic
