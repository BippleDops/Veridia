# The Deep Mother Subsystem
*Complete Rules for the Primordial Horror*

## Overview

The Deep Mother is not merely a creature or deityâ€”she is a primordial force that predates the current reality. This subsystem provides comprehensive rules for her influence, manifestations, cultists, and the various ways characters can interact with her cosmic horror.

## Core Concepts

### The Nature of the Deep Mother

The Deep Mother exists in three states simultaneously:
1. **The Dreaming Form**: Her sleeping body at the ocean's deepest point
2. **The Dream Projection**: Her consciousness spreading through water
3. **The Awakening Potential**: What she will become if fully roused

### Influence Mechanics

#### Influence Points (IP)
Regions accumulate Deep Mother Influence Points representing her growing power:
- 0-25 IP: Subtle signs, strange dreams
- 26-50 IP: Minor manifestations, cult activity
- 51-75 IP: Major events, reality distortions
- 76-99 IP: Catastrophic changes, mass mutations
- 100 IP: Localized awakening event

#### Gaining Influence
- Cult rituals: +1d4 IP per successful ceremony
- Character deaths in water: +1 IP each
- Use of deep magic: +1 IP per spell level
- Destroying her anchors: -2d6 IP
- Banishing avatars: -1d10 IP

## Dream Infiltration System

### Entering the Dreamscape

Characters can enter the Deep Mother's dreams through:
1. **Voluntary Methods**:
   - Dream ritual (8 hours, special components)
   - Consuming dream lotus from the depths
   - Using artifacts linked to her consciousness
   
2. **Involuntary Entry**:
   - Sleeping within 1 mile of 50+ IP zone
   - Critical failure on saves vs. her influence
   - Death while under her curse

### Dream Geography

The dreamscape consists of layered realms:

#### Surface Dreams (Safe-ish)
- Endless ocean under starless sky
- Islands of memory from drowned civilizations
- Navigation DC 12, Sanity DC 10

#### Middle Dreams (Dangerous)
- Underwater cities that never were
- Temporal loops of the drowning
- Navigation DC 15, Sanity DC 15

#### Deep Dreams (Lethal)
- The Mother's true thoughts
- Incomprehensible geometries
- Navigation DC 20, Sanity DC 20

#### The Core (Campaign-Ending)
- Direct contact with her sleeping mind
- Instant transformation or death
- Only survivable with artifacts
