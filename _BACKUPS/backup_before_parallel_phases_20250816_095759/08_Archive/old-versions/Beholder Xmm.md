Few creatures in the multiverse are as loathed and feared as these maniacal horrors. A beholder's distinctive, globular body is dominated by an oversize maw and a gigantic central eye. Ten stalks ending in smaller eyes crown its form. From each of these eleven eyes, a beholder can unleash a different magic power. The central eye can deactivate magic, while the smaller eyes emit rays that inflict various doomsâ€”such as petrifying creatures, disintegrating them, slaying them outright, or other effects. Beholders possess utterly alien minds. Most exhibit paranoid, narcissistic, and megalomaniacal tendencies, and they act on agendas beyond human reasoning. While some keep to themselves, others force weaker creatures into their service. Still others cultivate grand ambitions, creating networks of minions to manipulate groups, settlements, and whole nations in the Underdark and sometimes the surface world. Few creatures loathe beholders more than other beholders. Every beholder views itself as the physical and intellectual pinnacle of its species. To them, all other beholders are aberrant rivals to be dominated or destroyed. Conflicts between beholders can last for decades and lay waste to vast subterranean realms. Beholders are a particular threat to adventurers because both gravitate toward mysterious ruins and sites of great magic. Many beholders collect the magic items and [conditions#Petrified|petrified]] bodies of heroes they've defeated, displaying them as trophies. ### Beholder Lairs Beholders lurk in cavern complexes they've carved using their eye rays deep in the Underdark or in lairs created for them by their servants.```statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of beholder xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around beholder xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is protecting a witness for power
