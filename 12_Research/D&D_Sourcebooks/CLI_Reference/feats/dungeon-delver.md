# Dungeon Delver
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 166*  

Alert to the hidden traps and secret doors found in many dungeons, you gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) and Intelligence ([[skills#Investigation|Investigation]]) checks made to detect the presence of secret doors.  
- You have advantage on saving throws made to avoid or resist traps.  
- You have resistance to the damage dealt by traps.  
- Traveling at a fast pace doesn't impose the normal -5 penalty on your passive Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) score.
