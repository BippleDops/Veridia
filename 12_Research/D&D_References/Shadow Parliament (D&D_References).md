*20 targeted improvements identified*

### Connection Improvements

### Enhancement Improvements

- Add 12_Research-specific enhancement

## Role and Motive
Shadow Parliament moves information and influence like currency. Publicly pragmatic, privately driven by a personal stake in the Convergenceâ€™s shape.

- Ideal: Stability through controlled risk.
- Bond: A family archive tied to [[02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Sunken Library of Thalassius.md|The Sunken Library of Thalassius]].
- Flaw: Overconfidence in leverage; underestimates zealots and true believers.

## Player-Facing Summary

Shadow Parliament is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Shadow Parliament as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Shadow Parliament.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
