# D-019 Oracle Whale

## Read-Aloud
> A bass song vibrates the hull, not heard but felt—syllables like mountains moving through water. The notes arrange themselves into meaning.

## Setup
- Zone: Abyss • Category: Mystic/Discovery
- Non-hostile entity; poachers may be nearby

## Mechanics
- Interpret Song: Religion/Arcana DC 15
- Resist Revelation: Group Sanity DC 14
- Optional: Stealth DC 14 to avoid poachers; Tactics DC 14 to deter

## Outcomes
- Success: Gain prophecy token (1 future reroll)
- Partial: Vague omen; lore only
- Fail: Long-term madness 1

## Rewards
- Recording sells for 300–800 gp; Memory pearl (Rare) chance 25%

## Integrations
- [[Sanity System]]; [[Memory Trading Economy System|Memory Economy]]; Faction eco if poachers

## Scaling
- In merger, song shifts to cross-world omen; add Reality check

## Variants
- Whale asks for help protecting calves (escort mission)

## Quick-Run
- Call Sanity DC 14; if stable, allow interpretation; on success, grant token
