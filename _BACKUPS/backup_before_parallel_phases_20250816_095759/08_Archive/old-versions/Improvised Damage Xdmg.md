--- # Improvised Damage

*Generic Hazard* The Improvising Damage table gives guidelines for determining damage on the fly. The Damage Severity and Level table is a guide to how deadly these damage amounts are for characters of different levels. Cross-reference a character's level with the damage being dealt to gauge the severity of the damage. Nuisance damage rarely poses a risk of death to characters of the levels shown, but a severely weakened character might be laid low by this damage. Deadly damage poses a significant threat to characters of the levels shown and could potentially kill such a character that's missing many [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules). *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 30* [Dn D5e-Side Screen-2024]] ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Improvised damage xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
