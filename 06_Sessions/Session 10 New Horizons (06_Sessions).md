The heroes' choice has reshaped reality, but new challenges have emerged from their decision. Ancient enemies stir, new alliances form, and the heroes must defend their new world order while discovering what lies beyond the horizon of their victory. **[location|Location]]**: Variable based on previous session choices **Level**: 10th **Duration**: 6-8 hours **[[Key Theme**: Living with consequences and embracing the future```dataview TABLE choice-outcome, stability-rating, new-threats FROM "Seven_Shards_Campaign" WHERE contains(title, "convergence-outcome")```## Opening: [Six Months]] [[Later The session begins with a montage showing how the world has changed based on the heroes' convergence choice, followed by the emergence of a new cosmic threat. ### [The New]] [[World Order **[Scene Setup]]**: Varies dramatically based on Session 9 outcomes #### [[If Worlds [Were Separated]] > [!info] [[Separated Worlds [Time|Time]]line > The dimensional barriers have solidified into permanent crystal walls. Trade occurs through heavily regulated portal gates. Both worlds have developed new technologies to compensate for lost connections. The heroes are celebrated as saviors but some question if isolation was worth the price. **[[Current Challenges**:
- Smuggling operations through unstable micro-rifts
- Cultural stagnation without cross-world inspiration
- Resource shortages affecting both civilizations
- Growing movement to reunite the worlds #### [If Controlled]] [[Unity Was]] Chosen > [!info] [[Controlled Unity [Timeline|Timeline]] > Complex magical infrastructure maintains stable but limited connections between worlds. A joint council governs inter-dimensional affairs. The heroes serve as advisors but political tensions run high as both worlds struggle with shared goverce. **[[Current Challenges**:
- Political deadlock in the [Joint Council]]
- Shard energy fluctuations threatening stability
- Emerging nationalist movements in both worlds
- Corruption in the portal management systems #### [[If True [Merger Occurred]] > [!info] [[Merged Worlds Timeline > The combined realm shows patches of sky cities floating above underwater districts. New hybrid cultures emerge while traditional ones struggle to adapt. The heroes are founding members of the new world government but face constant crisis management. **[Current Challenges]]**:
- Environmental disasters from incompatible ecosystems
- Cultural conflicts between surface and depth dwellers
- Economic disruption from merged currencies
- Identity crises among displaced populations #### [[If Deep [Mother Returned]] > [!info] [[Deep Mother Timeline > The reformed [Deep Mother]] guides both worlds with benevolent wisdom, but individual agency has diminished. The heroes serve as her chosen representatives but question whether peace achieved through reduced free will is truly victory. **[[Current Challenges**:
- Resistance movements fighting against "guidance"
- Heroes questioning their own autonomy
- Discovery that other cosmic entities oppose the [Deep Mother]]
- Gradual erosion of personal choice and creativity ### Meta-[[Bind Status]] Tracker```meta-bind INPUT[progress Bar(min Value(0), max Value(100)):world-stability] **[[World Stability Factors**:

- They view existence as a contamination to be cleansed
- The shard convergence created "reality scars" they can exploit
- They cannot be fought with conventional means **[[The Growing Threat**:
- Void incursions are accelerating
- Each reality alteration makes the next easier
- [The Void]] Lords seek to unmake not just worlds, but the concept of existence
- Only unified action across all affected realities can stop them ## [[Main Event: [The Void]] [[Incursion The [Void Lords]] launch a coordinated assault on the heroes' reality, seeking to unravel the changes made during the convergence. ### [[The Assault on Reality **[Initiative Tracker]] Setup**:```initiative-tracker - name: [[Void Lord Prime hp: 300 ac: 22 initiative: 20
