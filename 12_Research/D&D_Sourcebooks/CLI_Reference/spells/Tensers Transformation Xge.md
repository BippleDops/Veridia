# Tenser's Transformation
*6th-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a few hairs from a bull)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You endow yourself with endurance and martial prowess fueled by magic. Until the spell ends, you can't cast spells, and you gain the following benefits:

- You gain 50 temporary hit points. If any of these remain when the spell ends, they are lost.  
- You have advantage on attack rolls that you make with simple and martial weapons.  
- When you hit a target with a weapon attack, that target takes an extra `2d12` force damage.  
- You have proficiency with all armor, shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons.  
- You have proficiency in Strength and Constitution saving throws.  
- You can attack twice, instead of once, when you take the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Attack|Attack]] action on your turn. You ignore this benefit if you already have a feature, like Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks.  

Immediately after the spell ends, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Exhaustion|exhaustion]].

**Classes**: [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard|Wizard]]
