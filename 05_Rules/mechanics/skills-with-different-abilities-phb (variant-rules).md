--- # Skills with Different Abilities

*Source: Player's Handbook p. 175* Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in [[skills#Athletics|Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the DM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your DM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your DM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your DM might allow you to apply your proficiency in [skills#Athletics|Athletics]] and ask for a Constitution ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics) check. So if you're proficient in [skills#Athletics|Athletics]], you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your DM might ask for a Strength ([skills#Intimidation|Intimidation]]) check, even though [[skills#Intimidation|Intimidation]] is normally associated with Charisma. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Skills with different abilities phb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
