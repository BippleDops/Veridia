The alchymic-unliving are creatures tainted by the curse of undeath through exposure to elixir of life. Those who partake in the forbidden fruits of such alchymic experimentation face a dismal future. It is true that death, or at least mortal death by aging, is no longer a concern, but the life left is bleak and bereft of any of the joys of the living.

Any living creature can be transformed into an alchymic-unliving creature that is exposed to elixir of life (see The [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Spells/PHB Spells/A-E/Blight]]: Richard Pett’s Crooked City by Frog God Games). An alchymic-unliving creature uses the base creature’s stat block, with the following differences:

Challenge increases by 1.

Strength increases by 2, Intelligence declines by 2.

Type becomes undead.

AC increases by 2.

Uses Charisma rather than Constitution to determine bonus hit points per hit die; recalculate hit points accordingly.

Immune to disease, exhaustion, paralysis, poison, stun, and unconsciousness.

Immune to effects that reduce ability scores or maximum hit points.

Gains darkvision 60 feet.

**Legendary Fortitude (3/day):** When the creature makes an unsuccessful Con saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

- **Curse of Undeath:** The creature must make a successful DC 15 Wis saving throw every 30 days or its Intelligence is permanently reduced by 1. If its Intelligence declines to 3, it transforms into a zombie.

**Regeneration:** An alchymic-unliving creature heals 1 hit point per 2 HD at the start of its turn, unless it took radiant damage since its last turn.
