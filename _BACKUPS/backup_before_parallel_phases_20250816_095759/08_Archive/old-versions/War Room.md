--- # War Room

*Level 17 Bastion facility* - **Prerequisites**: Fighting Style feature or Unarmored Defense feature
- **Space**: Vast (36 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 2+
- **Order**: recruit The War Room is where you plan military actions in consultation with an inner circle of loyal lieutets, each one a battle-hardened **Veteran Warrior** (see the "Monster Manual") whose alignment matches yours. You start with two lieutets but can add more, as described below. If your Bastion lacks facilities to house your lieutets, they secure accommodations in the inn or settlement closest to your Bastion. Lieutets are hirelings, not Bastion Defenders; however, if your Bastion is attacked (see ""Bastion Events"" at the end of this chapter), each lieutet housed in your Bastion reduces by 1 the number of dice you roll to determine how many Bastion Defenders are lost in the attack. The War Room contains war memorabilia plus a large table surrounded by enough chairs for you and your lieutets. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Recruit Options When you issue the "Recruit" order to this facility, choose one of the following options: - **Recruit.** Lieutet. You gain one new lieutet. You can have up to ten lieutets at any time. Assign names and personalities to them as you see fit. - **Recruit.** Soldiers. You commission one or more of your lieutets to assemble a small army. Each lieutet can muster one hundred [[Bestiary (see the "Monster Manual") in 7 days to fight for your cause. Reduce that number to twenty if you want them to be mounted on [riding-horse-xmm|Riding Horses]] (see the "Monster Manual"). It costs you 1 GP per day to feed each guard and each horse in your army. Wherever the army goes, it must be led by you or at least one of your lieutets, or else it disbands immediately. The army also disbands if it goes 1 day without being fed. Otherwise, the army remains until it is destroyed or you command it to disband. You can't issue this Recruit order again until your current army disbands or is destroyed. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 349* ## Player-Facing Summary War room is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of war room as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around war room. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A merchant needs help delivering before winter
