# Appendix C: Treasures
*Source: Curse of Strahd, p. 221* 

Scattered throughout Barovia are ancient treasures that can be brought to bear against [[strahd-von-zarovich-cos (legendary-group)]] and his fell servants. The locations of three of themâ€”the [[Tome of Strahd Cos]], the [[Holy Symbol of Ravenkind Cos]], and the [[sunsword-cos (items)]]â€”are determined by the results of the card reading in chapter 1. The other items can be acquired as characters discover their whereabouts during the course of the adventure.

## Tome of Strahd

![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/adventures/curse-of-strahd/img/136-cos18-01.webp#center)

The [[Tome of Strahd Cos]] is an ancient work penned by Strahd, a tragic tale of how he came to his fallen state. The book is bound in a thick leather cover with steel hinges and fastenings. The pages are of parchment and very brittle. Most of the book is written in the curious shorthand that only Strahd employs. Stains and age have made most of the work illegible, but several paragraphs remain intact and readable. If the characters acquire the [[Tome of Strahd Cos]] and want to read these paragraphs, show the players the "From the Tome of Strahd" section in appendix F.

If Strahd sees, or learns from a minion, that the tome has fallen into the party's possession, all of his other objectives (see chapter 1, "Into the Mists") are put on hold until the book is recovered. When Strahd attacks, his preferred target is whoever has the tome.
