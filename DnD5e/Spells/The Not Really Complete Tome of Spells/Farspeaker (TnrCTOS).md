You must touch each of these boxes in turn when casting the spell. Optionally, you can create one box covered in gold filigree and worth 500 gp; this box is the master box and you only need to touch this one to cast the spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you may enchant one additional box for each slot level above 3rd.
