# Mordaine's Curiosity Shop

## General Info
**Location**: [[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/Locations/Shadowhaven]]

## Description
Mordaine's Curiosity Shop is a small, cluttered shop that is filled with all manner of strange and exotic goods. It is a good place to find rare and unusual items, but it is also a front for the Shadowhaven Smugglers Ring's fencing operations.

## GM Notes
- The owner of the shop, [[05_Templates/Example_Campaign/NPCs/Whisper "Coin" Mordaine]], is a high-ranking member of the Ring.
- The shop is a good place to sell stolen goods, but the party will have to be careful not to attract the attention of the city guard.
- There is a secret entrance to the Undercity in the back of the shop.
