*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 208* Smoke mephits are elusive beings formed of fiery cinders and hot air. They love misleading creatures and then mocking them for their gullibility. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Mephits *Malicious Elemental Hooligans* - **Habitat.** Planar (Elemental Planes) - **Treasure.** None Mephits are mean-spirited tricksters that dwell on the Elemental Planes. The six most prominent types of mephits resemble halfling-size gargoyles with wings, exaggerated features, and bodies composed of two elements. Most live self-interested existences, indulging their warped senses of humor or overblown egos on their home planes of existence. Some serve as messengers or spies for genies or magic-users. Mephits resent leaving the elemental extremes where they make their homes. If loosed on the Material Plane or other realms, they lash out with nasty pranks or by tormenting weaker creatures. When destroyed, mephits explode in a burst of elemental magic. > [!quote] A quote from Seamusxanthuszenus, smoke mephit with a typically inflated impression of itself > > I am Seamusxanthuszenus, Slayer of Fiends, Merchant Most Excellent, Purveyor of Death!```statblock
