## Description
You can use an action to speak this [[Staff|staff]]’s command word and throw the staff on the ground within 10 feet of you. The staff becomes a [[Giant Constrictor Snake|giant constrictor snake]] under your control and acts on its own [[12 - The Order of Combat|initiative]] count. By using a [[12 - The Order of Combat|bonus action]] to speak the command word again, you return the staff to its normal form in a space formerly occupied by the snake.

On your turn, you can mentally command the snake if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren’t [[Incapacitated|incapacitated]]. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] your enemies or [[Guard|guard]] a location.

If the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and reverts to its [[Staff|staff]] form. The staff then shatters and is destroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before losing all its hit points, it regains all of them.
