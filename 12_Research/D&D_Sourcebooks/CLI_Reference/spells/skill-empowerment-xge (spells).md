--- # Skill Empowerment

*5th-level, Transmutation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour Your magic deepens a creature's understanding of its own talent. You touch one willing creature and give it expertise in one skill of your choice; until the spell ends, the creature doubles its proficiency bonus for ability checks it makes that use the chosen skill. You must choose a skill in which the target is proficient and that isn't already benefiting from an effect, such as Expertise, that doubles its proficiency bonus. **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 165* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Skill empowerment xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
