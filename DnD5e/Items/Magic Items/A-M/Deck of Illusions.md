# Deck of Illusions

## Overview

**Type**: Magic Item

**Group**: *Wondrous item*

**Rarity**: *Uncommon*

## Description

This box contains a set of [[Parchment|parchment]] cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing `dice: 1d20`(1d20) − 1 cards.

The magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.

An [[Illusion|illusion]] of one or more creatures forms over the Thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate [[13 - Movement and Position|size]], and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because [[11 - Objects|objects]] pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15 [[Intelligence|Intelligence]] ([[Intelligence|Investigation]]) check. The creature then appears translucent.

The [[Illusion|illusion]] lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can’t be used again. soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards [[13 - Movement and Position|fly]] from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.

| \*Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards |             |

***Balance.*** Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your [[2 - Alignment|alignment]] to change. Lawful becomes [[2 - Alignment|chaotic, good]] becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true [[2 - Alignment|neutral]] or [[2 - Alignment|unaligned]], this card has no effect on you.

***Comet.*** If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of [[14 - Monsters|monsters]] you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.

***Donjon.*** You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional [[2 - Casting a Spell|sphere]]. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can’t be located by any [[Divination|divination]] magic, but a **[[Wish|wish]]** spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.

***Euryale.*** The card’s [[Medusa|medusa]]-like visage curses you. You take a −2 penalty on [[6 - Saving Throws|saving throws]] while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.

***The Fates.*** Reality’s fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card’s magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.

***Flames.*** A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.

***Fool.*** You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.

***Gem.*** Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.

***Idiot.*** Permanently reduce your [[Intelligence|Intelligence]] by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.

***Jester.*** You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.

***Key.*** A rare or rarer [[Magic Weapon|magic weapon]] with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.

***Knight.*** You gain the service of a 4th-level [[Fighter|fighter]] who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until [[17 - Damage and Healing|death]], believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.

***Moon.*** You are granted the ability to cast the **[[Wish|wish]]** spell 1d3 times.

***Rogue.*** A nonplayer character of the GM’s choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn’t known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a **[[Wish|wish]]** spell or divine intervention can end the NPC’s hostility toward you.

***Ruin.*** All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than [[13 - Magic Items|magic items]], are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.

***Skull.*** You summon an avatar of [[17 - Damage and Healing|death]]—a ghostly humanoid [[Skeleton|skeleton]] clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM’s choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to [[14 - Actions in Combat|help]] you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can’t be restored to life.
