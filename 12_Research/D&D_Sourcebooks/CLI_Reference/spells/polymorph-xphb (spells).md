# Polymorph
*4th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You attempt to transform a creature that you can see within range into a Beast. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or shape-shift into Beast form for the duration. That form can be any Beast you choose that has a [[challenge-rating-xphb (variant-rules)]] equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level if it doesn't have a [[challenge-rating-xphb (variant-rules)]]). The target's game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen Beast, but the target retains its alignment, personality, creature type, [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]], and [[hit-point-dice-xphb (variant-rules)]].

The target gains a number of [[temporary-hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] equal to the [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] of the Beast form. These [[temporary-hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] vanish if any remain when the spell ends. The spell ends early on the target if it has no [[temporary-hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] left.

The target is limited in the actions it can perform by the anatomy of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells.

The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't use or otherwise benefit from any of that equipment.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
