# Disadvantage
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 366. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

If you have Disadvantage on a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb|D20 Test]], roll two d20s and use the lower roll. A roll can't be affected by more than one Disadvantage, and [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb|Advantage]] and Disadvantage on the same roll cancel each other.

## Adventure Hooks

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
