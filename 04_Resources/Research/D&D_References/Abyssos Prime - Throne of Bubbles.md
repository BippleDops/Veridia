The Throne of Bubbles serves as the ceremonial heart of Aquabyssos's royal power, a magnificent underwater structure where Queen Nerida holds court and receives dignitaries. The throne itself is carved from a single massive pearl, surrounded by continuously rising streams of luminescent bubbles that create an ethereal, otherworldly atmosphere. Located in the deepest chamber of the Royal Palace, it represents the ultimate symbol of authority over the underwater realm. The throne room combines natural underwater beauty with sophisticated magical engineering. Currents are carefully controlled to create dramatic effects, while bioluminescent creatures provide shifting, colored lighting that responds to the Queen's emotional state and the nature of proceedings. ## Physical Description

The throne itself sits on a raised dais at the center, carved from a pearl the size of a small building. Hundreds of thousands of enchanted bubbles continuously rise from hidden vents in the seafloor, creating columns of shimmering light that dance around the throne. Surrounding the central area are tiers of curved seating for courtiers, visiting dignitaries, and witnesses to royal proceedings.
