--- # INV-001 *"The first case that opened our eyes to the truth beneath the surface."* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

INV-001 represents the inaugural investigation conducted by inter-realm authorities into anomalous phenomena affecting both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. This foundational case involved the mysterious synchronization of tidal patterns with surface weather systems, leading to the discovery of previously unknown magical connections between the realms. ### Duration

Official investigation lasted six months, with ongoing implications for current policy. ## Adventure Hooks

1. **Case Review**: Characters investigate discrepancies in original findings
2. **Copycat Phenomenon**: Similar patterns emerge requiring new investigation
3. **Classified Evidence**: Discovery of suppressed evidence from original case ## Campaign Use

Provides historical foundation for investigation-based adventures and inter-realm cooperation storylines. ## Player-Facing Summary INV 001 is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of INV 001 as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around INV 001. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A shipment has gone missing and chaos spreads
