# Moon Angel
## Overview
### Moon Angel
![[np5v4vkj.5rp.png|Moon Angel|300]]
[[np5v4vkj.5rp.png|open outside]]

*This thin, stretched creature has gangly, long limbs that bend in unusual ways. Its skin is pale and sickly with its face shrunken in its drooping, hairless head. Pointed ears rise high above the crown of its head, and its eyes are sunk deep beneath its brow like two bottomless pits. Its toothless mouth hangs open, jaw slack, as it incessantly licks its withered lips.*

## Special Traits
**Drowning Kiss:** A moon angel can flood the lungs of a willing, sleeping, helpless, or hypnotized creature by touching it (traditionally by kissing the creature on the lips). If the target cannot breathe water, it immediately begins suffocating from drowning. A drowning creature makes a DC 13 Con saving throw at the end of its turn, coughing up the water and ending the effect with a success.

**Hypnotic Song:** A moon angel’s song has the power to entrance those that hear it. All creatures aside from other moon angels within 300 feet of a singing moon angle must make a successful DC 14 Wis saving throw or be charmed by all moon angels. While charmed this way, a creature’s speed is 0. A creature that successfully saves is immune to the hypnotic singing of all moon angels until the following sunrise. This effect lasts for as long as the moon angel continues singing and for 1 full round after it stops. A charmed creature is willing to accept a moon angel’s Drowning Kiss.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The moon angel attacks twice with its claws.

**Melee Attack—Claw:** +7 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d6 + 4` slashing damage plus `dice: 1d8` cold damage, and the creature must make a successful DC 13 Con saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A paralyzed creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect with a success.

## Description
**Environment**: Sea

**Organization**: Solitary or school (2-5)

Oftentimes folk who fall into the river, even in the relative shallows, are never seen again even if help was close at hand. At such times, folk who dwell near the riverside make the sign against the evil eye and blame the disappearance on hidden currents carrying the victim into the depths or the normal fauna that makes the Great Lyme a graveyard for hundreds of citizens of Castorhage every year. However, sometimes the cause of the disappearance is more sinister than either of those. Sometimes it is the work of a moon angel.

The moon angel is a rare creature that lurks in the deepest, coldest waters of the Lyme, fond of rising to the surface and quietly watching the goings-on ashore, waiting for the unfortunate soul who loses his footing or is more drunk than careful and falls into the dark waters of the river. When it locates such a victim, it quickly moves to hypnotize him and draw him deeper into the waters where it can feed at its leisure.

A creature of the coldest fathoms of the river where depth and pollution block the sun, a moon angel cannot stay long near the warm surface while it waits for prey. It becomes uncomfortable from the heat and light, and can even develop severe sunburns on its pale skin when remaining too close to the surface for long. For this reason, the depredations of the moon angels remain relatively rare. The occurrences do increase in the winter months when a thin sheet of ice often covers the river’s edges, though they still love the daylight no better then than they do in summer.

Occasionally on moonless nights, a moon angel may leave the river under the cover of darkness to hunt additional victims on land. At these times, such a creature tends to clamber along the rooftops to find open windows to take meat from within, with any household survivors the next morning describing only dreams of a strange crooning song echoing through their sleep. As with those who disappear into the river when a moon angel pays a visit, the unfortunate soul that has garnered its attention is never seen again. It for these incidences that the twisted fey known as moon angels gain their name, though few if any folk have made a connection between these nighttime disappearances and those that occur more frequently in the river.

Extremely tall and awkwardly gangly, the moon angel stands eight feet in height but weighs barely 250 lbs.
