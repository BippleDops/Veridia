*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 24. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* Alone or in small groups, axe beaks stalk prey to feed their flocks. When working together, axe beaks use rudimentary tactics, with some distracting threats while others strike vulnerable targets or rush young axe beaks to safety. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Axe Beaks *Flightless Avian Predators* - **Habitat.** Arctic, Grassland, Hill - **Treasure.** None Axe beaks are flightless, birdlike creatures with distinctive axe-shaped beaks. Swift predators, they chase down prey and use their beaks to hack through foliage protecting their quarry. Axe beaks live in varied environments. Colorfully plumed axe beaks race across tropical plains, while axe beaks with snowy feathers hunt the tundra. Axe beaks are difficult to train, but those hatched and raised in captivity can become reliable mounts. > [!quote] A quote from Batley Summerfoot, Adventurer > > The thing's got an axe for a face and a giant, angry rooster for everything else—of course I want to ride it!```statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of axe beak xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around axe beak xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
