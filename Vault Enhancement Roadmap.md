# Vault Enhancement Roadmap - Cordelia World Building

## Executive Summary
Strategic roadmap for optimizing and expanding the Aquabyssos/Aethermoor TTRPG vault through automated content generation, systematic organization, and narrative deepening.

## Phase 1: Content Completion (Immediate)
### Objectives
- Fill content gaps in existing stub files
- Complete missing cross-references
- Standardize metadata across all files

### Action Items
1. **Stub Resolution**

   - Create bidirectional links between related content
   - Build comprehensive relationship webs

3. **Metadata Standardization**
   - Ensure all files have complete frontmatter
   - Add missing tags, status, world, type fields
   - Implement consistent date formatting

### Automation Scripts
```bash
## Run stub processing

## Phase 6: Quality Assurance (Week 5-6)
### Objectives
- Validate all content consistency
- Test mechanical balance
- Ensure narrative coherence

### Validation Scripts
```bash
## Check timeline consistency
