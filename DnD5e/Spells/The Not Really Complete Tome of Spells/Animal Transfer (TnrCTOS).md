# Animal Transfer (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour


## Effects
You transfer your mind into the body of a beast, who may make a Charisma saving throw. You gain full control of the beast’s body and senses. You retain your mental abilities, but cannot cast spells while in this form, and you have the physical abilities of the creature you have taken over. Your body is comatose during this time; the animal’s mind is suppressed.

If the animal dies while you are control-ling it, your mind instantly returns to your own body. You suffer 3d6 psychic damage and must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, you suffer from a form of insanity for an hour where you believe you are that animal and you act accordingly.
