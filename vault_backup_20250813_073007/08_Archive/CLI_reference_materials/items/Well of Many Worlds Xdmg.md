# Well of Many Worlds
*Wondrous item, legendary*  



This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action to unfold the Well of Many Worlds and place it on a solid surface, whereupon it forms a two-way, 6-foot-diameter, circular portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the DM decides where it leads. The portal remains open until a creature within 5 feet of it takes a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action to close it by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up.

Once the Well of Many Worlds has opened a portal, it can't do so again for `d8` hours.
