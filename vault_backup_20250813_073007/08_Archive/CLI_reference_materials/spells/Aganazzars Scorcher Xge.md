# Aganazzar's Scorcher
*2nd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a red dragon's scale)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A line of roaring flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes `3d8` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `d8` for each slot level above 2nd.
