# Curse Tablet (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a lead tablet)

**Duration**: 1 week


## Effects
You inscribe your victim’s name on a lead tablet, invoke the spirits of the dead, and place the tablet in an occupied tomb.

Each midnight thereafter, your victim must succeed at a Wisdom saving throw. Failure means the subject suffers horrifying nightmares of his own death. When the tar-get wakes up, he will have taken a level of exhaustion that cannot be removed until he gets an undisturbed night’s rest. He will also take 1d10 psychic damage. The levels of exhaustion are cumulative. If the target succeeds on the saving throw, he is unaffected that night.

If your target succeeds at three saving throws in a row, the curse is broken and the spell ends. If the curse tablet, which radiates both magic and evil, is found and destroyed, this also breaks the curse, but it will inflict 1d10 psychic damage to the target as well.

Because the curse is laid upon the tablet and not directly on the target, a *remove curse* spell will not end the curse. It will, however, give the target advantage on the next night’s saving throw.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the spell lasts an additional two days per spell slot above 3rd level.
