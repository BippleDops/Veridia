_Source: Monster Manual_ Transformed by the creature's celestial presence, the domain of a unicorn might include any of the following magical effects: - Open flames of a non magical nature are extinguished within the unicorn's domain. Torches and campfires refuse to burn, but closed lanterns are unaffected. - Creatures native to the unicorn's domain have an easier time hiding; they have advantage on all Dexterity ([[skills#Stealth|Stealth]]) checks made to hide. - When a good-aligned creature casts a spell or uses a magical effect that causes another good-aligned creature to regain hit points, the target regains the maximum number of hit points possible for the spell or effect. - Curses affecting any good-aligned creature are suppressed. If the unicorn dies, these effects end immediately. ## Player-Facing Summary Unicorn is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of unicorn as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around unicorn. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A stranger needs help finding before dawn
