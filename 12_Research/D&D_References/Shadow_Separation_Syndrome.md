### Overview

Shadow Conspiracy surgical techniques can separate a person's shadow from their body, creating an independent entity while leaving the original diminished. This horrific transformation serves the conspiracy's infiltration goals.

#### Stage 1: Surgical Preparation
**Duration:** 2-4 hours
**Requirements:** Shadow surgeon, memory crystals, consciousness dampening
**Process:** Patient kept conscious during shadow extraction
**Survival Rate:** 85% for willing subjects, 60% for unwilling

#### Stage 2: Shadow Animation
**Duration:** 24 hours of stabilization
**Process:** Separated shadow gains independent consciousness
**Memory Transfer:** Shadow retains most original memories
**Personality Copy:** Shadow mirrors original but with altered loyalties

#### Stage 3: Original Conditioning
**Duration:** 1 week of psychological manipulation
**Process:** Original person's memory gaps filled with false information
**Goal:** Make original believe shadow never existed
**Success Rate:** 70% complete conditioning, 20% partial, 10% failure

#### Original Person (Post-Separation)
**Ability Score Changes:**
- Wisdom reduced by 4 (shadow contained intuition)
- Charisma reduced by 2 (diminished presence)
- Intelligence unchanged (knowledge intact)

**New Limitations:**
- Cannot cast spells requiring Wisdom 13+
- Disadvantage on Insight and Perception checks
- Vulnerable to charm and fear effects
- Memory gaps regarding personal history

**Compensation Effects:**
- Advantage on saves vs. shadow magic
- Cannot be tracked by magical means
- Immune to mind reading (thoughts incomplete)
- Reduced sleep requirements

#### Shadow Person (Independent Entity)
**Ability Scores:** Match original at time of separation
**Special Abilities:**
- Incorporeal movement through shadows
- Perfect disguise as original person
- Memory access to original's experiences
- Immunity to non-magical physical damage

**Limitations:**
- Vulnerable to radiant damage (double)
- Cannot enter consecrated ground
- Weakened in bright light (disadvantage)
- Tethered to original (max 1 mile distance)

#### Visual Identification
**Shadow Examination:**
- Original person casts no shadow in direct light
- Reflection appears "flat" or two-dimensional
- Eyes lack certain depths or warmth
- Subtle personality differences

**Magical Detection:**
- *Detect Magic* reveals necromancy aura
- *True Seeing* shows missing shadow
- *Zone of Truth* has unusual effects (half-truth responses)
- Divine magic feels "muffled" around affected person

#### Behavioral Signs
**Personality Changes:**
- Slightly different mannerisms or speech patterns
- Memory inconsistencies about personal details
- Reduced emotional responses
- Increased compliance with authority
- Difficulty with creative or intuitive tasks

#### Infiltration Tactics
**Identity Theft:**
- Replaces original in social situations
- Uses memories to maintain convincing facade
- Reports activities to Shadow Conspiracy
- Gradually alters original's relationships

**Information Gathering:**
- Accesses original's professional connections
- Learns secrets through intimate knowledge
- Manipulates trust relationships
- Plants false information strategically

#### Limitations & Vulnerabilities
**Physical Restrictions:**
- Cannot handle blessed items
- Affected by turning undead
- Requires darkness to fully manifest
- Cannot cross running water

**Psychological Weaknesses:**
- Obsessed with original person
- Jealous of original's "real" life
- Conflicted about identity
- Gradually develops independent personality

#### Magical Reunification
**Requirements:**
- Both original and shadow must be willing
- Performed during new moon
- Requires *Greater Restoration* and shadow magic
- Success chance: 60% + caster level

**Process:**
1. Original and shadow stand in magical circle
2. Shadow must voluntarily merge with original
3. Spellcaster channels reunification energy
4. Both entities experience temporary unconsciousness
5. Single person emerges with combined memories

#### Complications During Reunification
**Memory Conflicts:** Contradictory experiences create confusion
**Personality Integration:** Must reconcile different choices made
**Guilt Processing:** Original learns what shadow did in their name
**Identity Crisis:** Questions about which memories are "real"

#### NPC Infiltration
**Government Officials:** Shadows replace key decision makers
**Family Members:** Loved ones replaced by shadow duplicates
**Guild Leaders:** Economic manipulation through false leadership
**Religious Figures:** Corrupt spiritual guidance

#### Player Character Hooks
**Personal Stakes:**
- Family member undergoes separation
- Player discovers they're the shadow
- Original seeks their missing shadow
- Shadow begs for reunification

#### Investigation Scenarios
**Mystery Elements:**
- Behavioral changes in known NPCs
- Political decisions that don't make sense
- Economic policies favoring conspiracy
- Religious corruption spreading

#### Medical Treatment
**Physical Therapy:** Relearning intuitive responses
**Psychological Counseling:** Processing trauma and memory gaps
**Magical Healing:** Restoring damaged mental connections
**Social Rehabilitation:** Rebuilding relationships

#### Support Groups
**Shadow Survivors:** Others who've experienced separation
**Family Counseling:** Helping loved ones understand changes
**Professional Reintegration:** Adjusting to reduced capabilities
**Spiritual Guidance:** Religious support for identity questions

#### Protection Gear
- **Light Sources:** Prevent shadow manifestation
- **Blessed Items:** Harm shadow entities
- **Warding Circles:** Protect during reunification
- **Emergency Beacons:** Call for help during separation
