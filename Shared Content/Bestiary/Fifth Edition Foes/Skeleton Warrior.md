## Special Traits
**Crypt Fatigue:** A creature infected with crypt fatigue gains one level of exhaustion immediately, and gains one more level every time it fails the DC 16 Constitution saving throw after taking damage from a skeleton warriors longbow. An infected creature must make another DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the end of every long rest; with a successful save, it recovers from one level of exhaustion, but with a failed save, it gains one level of exhaustion. The disease is cured when the victim no longer has any levels of exhaustion.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** The skeleton warrior can choose to change a failed saving throw to an automatic success.

**Track Circlet:** A skeleton warrior can track and find its circlet unerringly. It can also find the last person who possessed the circlet.

**Unholy Fortitude:** Skeleton Warriors are highly resistant to turning. They have tactical advantage on saving throws against being turned.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A skeleton warrior attacks three times with its greatsword or twice with its longbow.

**Greatsword +2:** *Melee Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (`dice: 2d6+7`) slashing damage plus 7 (`dice: 2d6`) necrotic damage.

**Longbow:** *Ranged Attack:* +6 to hit, range 150 ft./600 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d12+1`) piercing damage plus 7 (`dice: 2d6`) necrotic damage, and the target must make a successful DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be infected with crypt fatigue (see above).

**Attack:** The skeleton warrior attacks once with its greatsword or longbow.

**Drain Life:** +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: the target must make a successful DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be infected with crypt fatague. If already infected, a failed saving throw causes the creature to gain another level of fatigue.

**Instill Dread:** One living creature within 50 feet of the skeleton warrior, which the skeleton warrior can see, must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for `dice: 2d4` rounds. A successful save renders the target immune to this skeleton warriors dread for 24 hours.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any land, underground

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
The skeleton warrior is an undead creature that was once a powerful fighter of at least 8th level. Legend says that skeleton warriors were forced into their undead state by a powerful [[Thalasskoptis, Demon Prince|demon prince]] who trapped each of their souls in a golden circlet. A skeleton warrior’s only purpose is to search for and regain the circlet containing its soul.

A skeleton warrior appears as a desiccated humanoid corpse dressed in the same armor and clothes it wore during life, but showing the signs of great age and wear. Aside from its armor and weapons, a skeleton warrior could easily be confused for a lich.

## Skeleton Warrior's Circlet
In the process of transforming into a skeleton warrior, the dying warrior’s soul is trapped in a golden circlet. Anyone possessing one of these circlets can exert control over the skeleton warrior whose soul the circlet contains. To establish control, the controller must be within 300 feet of the skeleton warrior, must wear the circlet, and must spend one full round doing nothing but concentrating on the skeleton warrior. If the controller is not interrupted during this time, resolve a Cha (Intimidation) contest between the skeleton warrior and the creature with the circlet (note that the skeleton warrior adds its proficiency bonus to Intimidation skill checks). If the wearer of the circlet wins the contest, the skeleton warrior is charmed, views that character as an ally, and interprets any of the character’s suggestions in the most positive light. It is not dominated or controlled, but it doesn’t feel the urge to immediately kill the wearer of the circlet and recover its soul, either. It would like its soul back eventually, but it can wait until its new ally is slain by some other creature or dies naturally.

While within 300 feet of the charmed skeleton warrior, a person wearing the circlet can exert the following types of influence over the skeleton warrior. He or she can:

- choose to see through the skeleton warrior’s eyes;

- try to force the skeleton warrior to attack something by making a successful DC 15 Cha check (failing the check means the skeleton warrior acts as it chooses);

- try to force the skeleton warrior to take some other action—search an area, move across a room, etc.—by making a successful DC 10 Cha check (failing the check means the skeleton warrior acts as it chooses);

- try to place the skeleton warrior in “inert mode” by making a successful DC 15 Cha check. If this check succeeds, the skeleton warrior stands motionless, effectively unconscious and paralyzed, until the wearer of the circlet wills it back into wakefulness. If this check fails, the skeletal warrior is no longer charmed.

While forcing the skeleton warrior to do anything, the circlet wearer can’t move or take any other action. If the circlet wearer moves more than 300 feet away from the skeleton warrior or removes the circlet from his or her head while the skeleton warrior is active (not inert), the skeleton warrior is no longer charmed. If someone else becomes the circlet’s owner, the skeleton warrior knows instantly; if it was charmed, it’s not anymore, and if it was inert, it becomes active again.

If a skeleton warrior ever gains control of the circlet containing its soul, it places the circlet on its head and “dies,” vanishing in a flash of light. The circlet falls to the ground and crumbles to dust.
