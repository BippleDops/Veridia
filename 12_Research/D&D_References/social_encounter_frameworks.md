### Implementation Framework

Social encounter tracking:
```python
class SocialEncounter(BaseModel):
    encounter_type: str  # "negotiation", "investigation", "persuasion", "deception"
    participants: List[str]
    social_stakes: Dict[str, List[str]]  # What each participant risks/gains
    information_available: List[str]  # Knowledge that can be shared/discovered
    relationship_impacts: Dict[str, Dict[str, int]]  # How relationships might change
    success_conditions: Dict[str, List[str]]  # What constitutes success for each party
    
class SocialCombatant(BaseModel):
    name: str
    composure: int  # Emotional stability
    credibility: int  # Believability
    influence: int  # Social power
    information_value: int  # Useful secrets/knowledge
    motivations: Dict[str, str]  # Public, private, secret goals
    social_armor: List[str]  # Reputation, allies, protections
