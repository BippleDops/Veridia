## AI Assistant Guidelines
When developing content:
1. Maintain internal consistency with existing lore
2. Create multi-layered conflicts (personal, political, cosmic)
3. Include sensory descriptions for immersion
4. Build interconnected storylines not isolated content
5. Consider pressure/altitude mechanics in all encounters
6. Reference existing NPCs and locations frequently
7. Add moral complexity to faction relationships
8. Include both public faces and hidden truths for organizations
9. ALWAYS verify file placement before moving
10. NEVER accidentally move files to backups folder
