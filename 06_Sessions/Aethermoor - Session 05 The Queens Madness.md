[[Captain Lyanna Brightshield crashes through the party's hideout window, begging for help to save the possessed Queen. The party must navigate the transformed palace, witness the Queen's struggle against an ancient Aquabyssos consciousness, and learn the shocking truth about the [Crimson Sage]]'s identity while racing against time before the [[Crystal Festival. ## [Strong Start]]

> *Read aloud:* "Glass explodes inward as [[Captain Lyanna Brightshield crashes through your window, her armor cracked, blood seeping from crystal wounds that spread like frost across her skin. She collapses, gasping: '[The Queen]]... She's fighting it... Something ancient speaks through her, but she's still in there!' She grabs you desperately. 'The palace is a trap, but the old siege tunnels... From the War of [[Three Crowns... She showed them to me once, when she still...' Her eyes fill with tears. 'Please. I know what she's done looks like madness, but there are moments when she breaks through. Help me save her. We have less than 72 hours.'" ### Location: [[[Ancient Tunnels]] [[Beneath Palace]]

**Atmosphere**: Darkness older than the city, walls carved with pre-Meridian symbols, dripping water that whispers in Aquan. ### Lyanna's Guidance

As she leads, Lyanna reveals:
- She and the Queen were lovers before royal duties intervened
- [[The Queen found the shard while seeking cure for her father's illness
- Seraphina's last clear message: "[Find Celestia]]"
- The possession grows stronger near water
- [[The Queen hid weapons against possession in the throne room ### Discovery: Pre-[Meridian Ruins]]

**Investigation **DC 18** reveals**:
- These tunnels predate the palace by centuries
- Carved symbols match Aquabyssos architectural style
- Water damage suggests ancient flooding
- Central chamber contains dried pool with crystallized bones ### [[The Wet Chambers

Deeper sections partially flooded:
- **[Pressure Effects]]**: **DC 13** CON save or gain 1 exhaustion
- **[[Aquabyssos Bleed-Through**: Glimpses of underwater palace
- **[Ancient Whispers]]**: WIS save **DC 14** or hear the Drowned calling ### Location: [[garden

**Transformation**: Royal gardens now forest of living crystal, nobles wandering in synchronized patterns. ### [Stealth Challenge]]

**[[Group Stealth Check **DC 15****:
- **Success**: Navigate without alerting nobles
- **Failure**: Nobles converge, attempt to integrate party
- **[Critical Success]]**: Overhear possession entity's plans
- **[[Critical Failure**: Entire garden activates ### [Noble Coterie]] Encounter ([[If Detected)

**3 [Possessed Nobles]]** (CR 4 each):
- AC 15, HP 45
- [[Charm Person at will
- Suggestion 1/day
- [Crystal Burst]] on death: DEX **DC 14** or `dice: 2d6` piercing ### [[The Reflection Pool

Center of garden:
- Shows viewers as fully crystallized
- Queen's reflection sometimes shows her true self
- Touching water: CON save **DC 16** or gain `dice: 1d3` corruption
- Hidden beneath: Royal signet ring (bypasses throne room wards) ### Location: [[[Throne Room]] - Heart of Palace (D&D_References)]]

**Transformation**: Massive crystal growing from throne, reality fractures showing glimpses of Aquabyssos. ### Witnessing the Pre-Ritual

Party observes from hidden vantage:
- Queen conducts practice ritual with increasingly complex movements
- Her voice alternates between her own and ancient masculine tone
- Crystal patterns form Aquabyssos royal seal
- Moments of clarity where she deliberately makes mistakes ### [[The Queen's Struggle

**Every 10 minutes, roll d20**:
- 1-5: Full possession, ancient personality
- 6-10: Confused state, mixed personalities - 11-15: Queen fighting for control
- 16-19: Queen domit briefly
- 20: Queen fully herself for 1 minute ### [Queen Seraphina]] (Possessed)

**[[During Possession**:
- Speaks of "reclaiming the drowned throne"
- References "when the waters rose to swallow the sun"
- Calls for "the seven fragments of the prison"
- Mentions "the bloodline awakening" **[During Clarity]]**:
- Tries to warn party through code
- Leaves clues in crystal formations
- Whispers "Find my sister... She lives..."
- Fights to disrupt her own ritual ### [[The Possession Entity

**Revealed as**: [Archmage Thalassos]], [[Last King of Aquabyssos
- Ruled during the drowning
- Created the original [Seven Shards]] to contain something worse
- Now seeks to raise Aquabyssos by sinking Aethermoor
- Believes drowning is evolution, not death ### [[Hidden Weapons Cache

**Investigation **DC 16** at throne base**:
- [Dispel Magic]] scrolls (3)
- Anti-possession circlet (damaged but repairable)
- Letters between Queen and someone signed "C.S."
- Vial labeled "In case I lose myself" (poison) ### Location: [[[[Secret Vault [Beneath Throne]]]]

**Access**: Hidden switch in throne arm + royal seal ### [[The Crimson [Sage Appears]]

**[[Dramatic Entrance**: Teleportation circle activates
- Crimson robes fall away revealing...
- [Princess Celestia]] Lumengarde, thought dead 20 years
- Aged beyond her years, eyes holding deep sorrow
- Immediately begins casting protective circles #### [[The Bloodline Revelation

**Celestia examines party**: "One of you carries it. The blood of both worlds."
- **Test**: Each party member touches shard fragment
- **[Carrier Reaction]]**: Crystal patterns form but don't corrupt
- **Revelation**: They're descended from pre-drowning nobility
- **Implication**: Can control the merger, not just stop it #### [[Ancient Texts

**Written in [Old Aquan]] and [[Ancient Common**:
- Original drowning was intentional sacrifice
- Created barrier between worlds to contain "[Deep Mother]]"
- [[Seven Shards are keys, not prison
- Prophecy of worlds reuniting when "blood remembers water" ### [The Choice]]

**Celestia presents options**:
1. **Kill the Queen**: Ends possession but destroys hope of controlled merger
2. **[[Complete Possession Ritual**: [Saves Queen]] but risks everything
3. **[[Redirect Ritual**: Requires bloodline carrier sacrifice
4. **[Attempt Exorcism]]**: Low success chance, could kill Queen
5. **[[Find Alternative Vessel**: Transfer possession to willing host ### [Crystal Guard]] Elite ([[If Alarm Raised)

**6 [Elite Guards]]** (CR 4 each):
- AC 18, HP 52
- Resistance to non-magical damage
- Crystalline halberds (reach, `dice: 1d10`+4 plus exposure)
- [[Formation Fighting: Advantage when adjacent to ally ### [The Queen]]'s Shadow ([[If Confrontation)

**[Modified Archmage]] Stats**:
- AC 20 (magical barriers)
- HP 120
- [[Legendary Resistance (3/day) **[Lair Actions]]** (Initiative 20):
- Crystal spikes erupt from floor
- Gravity reverses in 30 ft sphere
- Psychic scream forces WIS save **DC 16** or stunned **[[Legendary Actions** (2/round):
- Cast cantrip
- Teleport 30 ft
- Summon crystal echo of party member ### [Documents Found]]

1. Treaty between Aethermoor and Aquabyssos (300 years old)
2. Bloodline genealogies showing intermarriage
3. Celestia's notes on possession resistance
4. Map to other shard locations
5. Ritual modification instructions ### [[The Shard Network

Learn that shards are connected:
- Destroying one damages others
- Moving one alerts guardians of all
- Using one's power awakens the rest
- Together they can reshape reality
- Separated they maintain the barrier ### Lyanna's Confession

If pressed, reveals:
- Has been meeting with Queen's clear moments
- Knows about underground resistance
- Has list of uncorrupted guards
- Can signal allies when time comes
- Will die for the Queen without hesitation ### [The Bloodline]] Awakening

> *Read aloud:* "As you debate the impossible choices before you, the bloodline carrier suddenly convulses. Crystal patterns race across their skin—not the purple of corruption, but silver-white like moonlight on water. Their eyes roll back, and when they speak, it's in harmonized voices:

> > '[[The Seventh Shard awakens. The prison weakens. [The Deep]] Mother stirs.'
> Visions flood everyone's mind: a vast shape beneath the ocean, older than gods, larger than continents. Its eye opens—an eye the size of a city.
> The carrier collapses, gasping: '[[The Festival... Tomorrow night... If the ritual completes, it's not Aquabyssos that rises. It's HER.'
> Celestia goes pale. 'The entity possessing my sister—he's not trying to raise his kingdom. He's trying to feed it to something far worse. We have 24 hours.'
> Through the windows, you see the [Crystal Festival]] preparations accelerating. Citizens move like sleepwalkers toward the grounds. The transformation has begun." ## Connection to Aquabyssos

This session establishes:
- Direct possession by Aquabyssos royalty
- Physical overlap beginning in palace
- Bloodline carrier as living bridge
- [[Deep Mother as true threat
- Merger as potentially necessary evil ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## [Plot Hooks]] - Strange dreams suggest ancient magic
