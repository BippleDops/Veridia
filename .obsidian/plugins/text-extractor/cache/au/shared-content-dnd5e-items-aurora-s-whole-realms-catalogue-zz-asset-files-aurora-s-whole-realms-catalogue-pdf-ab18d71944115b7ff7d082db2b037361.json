During a campaign in turn-of-the-century America, Anne Brown happened upon a reprint of a 1902 mail-order catalogue. She brought the catalogue to the next session to let the PCs do some shopping. Over the following weeks, the catalogue proved as handy and oft-referenced as the materials provided for the game; it showed just what was available in 1902, with illustrations, descriptions, and prices for items from plows to electric belts (don’t ask). Clearly, if such a reference could help recreate the familiar world of turn-of-the-century America, a similar catalogue could help recreate the for- eign world of medieval fantasy. That’s how Aurora’s Catalogue was conceived. Its maturation, however, was a bit more involved. Anne and I spent many hours poring over materials from the extensive (and frightening) TSR library and the University of Wisconsin Library—among the highest ranked research facilities in the nation. (Jon Pickens’ apartment has a slightly higher ranking: he provided over 20 useful resources, allowed unlimited checkout time, and supplied 24 hour reference.) From over 10,000 pages of material we gleaned loads of authentic medieval items to offer. To these we added many fantastic inventions from the timeless genius of Leonardo Da Vinci—everything from barely functional flying machines to scythe-bladed war wagons. Other contraptions are of our own creation, things calculated to help AD&D® game PCs. Finally, we accessed the mutual brain of Greenwood and Grubb for odd items and peoples of Faerun that should somehow figure into the catalogue. The whole process is summed as follows: every item that appears here is either au- thentically medieval or suitably fantastic. The best items are both. We purposely avoided magical items (“how much are you asking for the Wand of Orcus?”) because careless acquisition of magic can completely unbalance a game. And in concern for game balance and flavor, DMs should allow themselves absolute latitude in determin- ing the availability of products. A DM whose players face an attack of giant slugs may say that salt is unavailable, or sell it by gross tonnage! DMs who distribute money one copper at a time might begin a green-stamp purchasing program; others who run Monty Haul campaigns may double costs. Aurora’s Guide was meant not only to be flexible in prices, but also in uses. When PCs enter a cheese shop, let them page through the cheese section of Aurora’s and read some of the entries to learn what sort of fare appears in the shop. When an angry mob chases a monster to a castle, outfit them with the laborer’s tools as weapons. When you need any adventure idea, call the PCs to the catalogue station and have Aurora hire them to find her lost shipment (of Maztican cotton, Shou Lung silk, etc.). Shop early; shop often. Our hope is that Aurora’s Catalogue will become the most tattered (and loved) book in your gaming collection. 4 A Word from Our Founder Welcome to Aurora’s Emporium! You are about to embark on the finest shopping experience in all of Faerun. I am pleased to bring you the widest selection of impeccable merchandise available any- where on the continent. No doubt you’ve already thumbed through the pages of this catalogue and ad- mired my wide variety of goods and their lavish descriptions and illustrations. My small staff of scribes and artists has spent countless hours preparing this tome for du- plication. A second staff of apprentice mages spends its days magically copying and distributing these volumes to my catalogue outlets. I regret that my catalogues cannot leave the outlets, as public distribution has proven too expensive, but be assured that each outlet is furnished with enough copies so there is never a wait to browse. How Aurora’s Emporium Works For those of you who are new to my catalogue bazaar, let me explain how my system operates. My agents and I purchase goods from traveling peddlers, wholesalers, indi- vidual craftspersons, and a long list of reputable merchants. I never knowingly buy from the black market; my divination spells ensure this! Merchandise is shipped in from the four corners of Faerun to my central warehouse, the location of which is a well-guarded secret. (Incidentally, I move my entire warehouse about once a year to ensure the security of its location.) My catalogue outlets are sprinkled across the continent, in all major cities. Current- ly, I have six outlets in Waterdeep alone! New outlets are opening monthly—if you’re not near a convenient location now, chances are good that another will open soon! When your order is taken at one of my outlets, it is placed in a batch with other orders from the outlet. Every morning and every evening, orders are teleported to the central warehouse, where the merchandise is picked and batched. My staff assembles an outlet’s orders; then, using magical platforms of teleportation, the orders are shipped to their respective stores. Especially large orders or items are frequently re- duced in size magically, then enlarged at the destination. Orders typically arrive at the outlets in two to three days. Outlet staff can advise you on current shipping trends. Shipping times may be slightly longer near major holidays—plan ahead! Orders are processed in the order they are received. The exception to this rule is disaster relief—if a locale is ravaged by fire or flood, for example, their orders for food, blankets, clothing, etc. are always filled first. Again, outlet staff can advise you if such conditions exist. Ordering Instructions Order forms are available at all catalogue outlets. My trained staff will assist you and advise you. For all orders, a 25% deposit is required when the order is placed. (Certain items require payment in full when ordering—refer to individual item descriptions.) Your deposit is cheerfully refunded if an item is out of stock. If you don’t see it, ask! Frequently, I have merchandise in stock that hasn’t found its way into an updated catalogue. 5 When your merchandise arrives, you may examine it at the outlet before complet- ing your purchase. If it does not meet with your satisfaction, you may reject the ship- ment and your deposit will be refunded. Once the merchandise leaves the premises, however, we cannot accept any returns or exchanges. Unless prior arrangements are made, orders are stored at an outlet for 14 days. After that time, merchandise is returned to the warehouse and the deposit is forfeited. Rush Delivery —If you require same-day delivery on your merchandise, we can usually accommodate your needs. A nonrefundable surcharge of 15% is added to your order. Substitutions We occasionally substitute merchandise pictured in the catalogue. If the exact item is unavailable, a similar item may be shipped. You always have the option to examine and refuse such items. Color Selections When purchasing clothing or fabrics, outlet staff will have a list of colors available in addition to those listed in the catalog entries. If these colors do not suit your needs, consider using our dyeing service. For an additional 10% fee, have your garment or fabric dyed to order from our extensive collection of common and exotic dyes. A swatch booklet is available at all outlets to assist you in your selection. Please allow 3-4 extra days for these special orders. Work For Hire When visiting catalogue outlets, please check the notice board for job postings. I am frequently in need of novice mages for mundane spellcasting, hired muscle to serve as caravan escorts, or sometimes groups of intrepid adventurers to hunt down lost shipments or locate an obscure item. I pay handsomely, commensurate with the danger and difficulty of a task. I’m extremely proud of the selection and quality of merchandise I can offer you. I hope you’ll be surprised and delighted by my catalogue bazaar! 6 AXE, HATCHET: Among the simplest and most versatile tools of the woodsman is the axe. Whether used to cut firewood or to cleave hobgoblins, a keen axe can be a lifesaver. Our full- size woodsman’s axe (3 gp) comes with a Ranger's Field I do not offer weapons or armor: few fighters would buy a long-sword not crafted and weighted for his or her stance, or buy armor as though it were stretchable stockings. Even so, my catalogue does contain equipment for warriors. The following equipment works well not only in the hands of a ranger, but also in those of any warrior who spends much time in the wilderness. The hunting and fishing gear are incomparable, and the tree seats and beds suit anyone on the prowl for orcs. All of our ranger gear is constructed of durable and light-weight material and fits easily onto our equipment frame. leather case, as does our hatchet (2 gp). Axe: Wt 6 lb; Sz M; Tp S; Spd Fctr 7; Dmg 1d6+1/1d6+1; two-handed Hatchet: Wt 3 lb; St S; Tp S; Spd Fctr 4; Dmg 1d4+1/1d4+1; one-handed BODY SLEIGH: Whether you need an easy way to haul a slain deer back to camp or a fast method for taking a wounded friend from the fray, you will want to be carrying our body sleigh. The durable canvas sleigh wraps in moments about a downed creature, and the leather harness straps easily to your shoulders. When in your rucksack, the body sleigh weighs a mere 8 pounds, and when hauling a body, it allows you to move rapidly. (8 gp) works for up to L creatures; user can haul in lbs 10 times Str at ¾ movement rate, 20 times Str at 1/2 movement rate, and 25 times Str at ¼ movement; can pull for number of rounds equal to Con before exhaustion CAGES: Most natural animals are trainable to some degree, growing hostile only when provoked. With our variously-sized cages, rangers can keep animals either for taming or training. Our fowlers’ cages (8 gp) are built of sturdy bamboo from Hungtse and provide enough space for creatures from tit-mouse to falcon sizes. We also offer brass cages of the same size (12 gp) for gnawing rodents such as ferrets and squirrels. Both types are easily collapsible into flat and light-weight panels that fit snugly on our equipment pack. For larger creatures, see our offerings of collars and leashes. 7 Ranger's Field Wt 2 lb (bamboo)/5 lb (brass); require 1 turn to set up, collapse; proper cage provides +1 to Animal training checks for taming or training Dagger boots: Wt 3 lb; S S; T P; Spd Fctr 3; Dmg 1d4/1d4; heavy tread makes person easier to track (+2 to Tracking proficiency of person following) C ORDING MALLET: Though axes may be best for felling trees, a cording mallet is best for splitting the wood thereafter. With a solid steel triangular head that weighs 20 lbs, the woodsman needs only to lift the corder high and let it drop onto the wood to be split. Lumberers I know say that a cording mallet can split twice the wood an axe can, merely because cording mallets never bind. The steel handle prevents breakage if the wood is missed. (10 gp) Cording mallet: Wt. 25 lb; S M; Typ S/B; Spd Fctr 12; Dmg 1d8/1d8; Hit Prob. -2 DAGGER BOOTS: Originally meant for tree climbing, these sharp-toed boots have become popular weapons as well. Constructed of fine grain leather and well-tempered steel, dagger boots provide a sure toehold on even the smoothest bark. Dagger boots have also proven useful in scraps with orcs and other such creatures. Because the claw-shaped blade of these boots is raised from the ground, dagger boots do not impair movement. EQUIPMENT FRAME: A well hung pack can make the difference between stamina and fatigue. Our equipment frame (10 gp) is a light (5 lb) steel harness that centers weight upon the hips rather than the shoulders. Bristling with one-way hooks, the frame can be loaded with rucksack, waterskins, weaponry, map scrolls, and all manner of equipment in easy reach. For an added 3 sp, we supply a canvas fly that drapes over the frame, protecting equipment and body alike from even torrential rains. shifts encumbrance level down one category (e.g. from severe to heavy) when used FIELD GLASS: This new product comes from the ingenious craftsmen of the Shining South. A tapered piece of leather contains pockets that hold specially ground pieces of glass. When removed from their pockets, fitted in the clips at the ends of the leather, and encased by the buttoned leather roll, these pieces of glass work an odd magic: they make distant things appear close, 8 Ranger's Field and close things appear blurry. Though this oddity might seem useless at first glance, imagine the application on the battlefield or when spying on an enemy camp. (25 gp) doubles the range and detail-level of normal vision (see “Vision and Light” in the PHB) FISHING TACKLE: Those who do not like fish do not live near water. Fish fried within the hour of its capture is among the most luscious meals to be had. Our fishing tackle kit (10 gp) includes a birchwood rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, narrow netting, and any other items you might need for individual fishing. We also supply lobster traps (5 gp) for those who live along northern reaches of the Trackless Sea, and eel traps (3 gp) designed for placement in rivers. most items in the kit are required for use of Fishing proficiency (DM’s discretion); not needed for spear fishing FOWLERS’ SNARES: Birds are among the most alluring, elusive, and powerful creatures of the forest. We offer fowlers’ snares for small and trainable birds such as the sparrow or the exotic mynah of Shou Lung, as well as traditional birds of prey such as the falcon and hawk. Both sizes of snare have open weave construction so that the bird will not feel enclosed until the door snaps shut behind it. Small-bird: 1 gp; Large-bird: 3 gp. HUNTING KNIVES: Our set of five hunting knives includes a 7-inch full- bellied blade for quick kills, a 5-inch serrated blade for tough hides, a 4-inch blade for cutting bone and wood, a hooked blade for opening bellies without knicking guts, and another blade for quick skinning. All these knives come with their own sheath, which buttons into a leather carrying pack. (12 gp) treat 7- and 5-inch blades per dagger; treat remaining blades as per knife 9 Ranger's Field HUNTING TRAPS: Though any ranger worth his salt can cobble together a sufficient animal trap in half an hour, most such traps tend to be lethal or torturous in nature. By contrast, we offer both live and lethal traps. Our live traps come in three sizes—rabbit (4 gp, 3 lb), boar (7 gp, 8 lb), and bear (12 gp, 15 lb), all of which can be set up in ten minutes. Our lethal trap (10 gp) works on any size of animal and is mercifully swift. These baited traps contain opposing blades that spring closed when an animal comes to feed, decapitating it instantly. LEASHES: Though a trained bear might make a fine companion in the wilds, it would doubtless cause a panic if brought unleashed into a city. We therefore offer chain leash and collar assemblies in various sizes: common cat (2 sp); small dog (4 sp); common dog (5 sp); wolf (6 gp), dire wolf (8 sp). These sets are not meant for use on sapient creatures. proper leash provides + 1 to Animal Training proficiency check PROVISION BAG: After a long day’s hike, nothing tastes better than a venison steak, a cup of cold wine and a slice of cheese. Unfortunately, the other forest inhabitants could not agree more. However, our leather provision bag not only holds smells in, but also allows victuals to be hung from tree branches, well out of the reach of dangerous animals. By cinching the mouth tight, casting the rope over a tree-limb and hoisting the bag, food can be stored safely away from roving animals. (3 gp) ROPE LADDER: Not a device typically needed by fleet-footed rangers, rope ladders become most useful when a ranger’s camp entertains nonadventurers. I know of one famous ranger who established a whole citadel in the wood, with houses in the trees and rope ladders to every door. Our rope ladders are also useful as bridges. We use only ¾ inch hemp with 2-inch board slats, for loads up to 800 pounds. Our rope ladders are sold in two-foot increments, minimum of 8 feet, maximum of 60 (1 sp/4 ft). does not require Mountaineering proficiency or thief Climb Walls check; wt equals length 10 Ranger's Field SAW, FOLDING: Tree-felling tools are commonly quite bulky. Few adventuring woodsmen can carry an axe and saw upon the trail. However, with our new folding saw, woodsmen can have a sharp and sturdy blade on hand at any time. Merely by removing the retaining band, opening the hinged blade, and locking it in place with the flat band, the woodsman can have a blade ready. cuts through 4 in sq of soft wood per round, 2 in sq of hardwood; ineffective as a weapon the dwarven saying goes, “No sword is ever sharp enough.” So too, no ranger’s aim is ever perfect enough. Those who can hit the bullseye a number of targets to aid users of missile weapons. Our 2' diameter circular target (1 sp) is made of linen and straw and marked at its exact center with a black X. Our 1' diameter circular target (3 sp) is made of 2\" thick cork. We also offer a pair of 1' targets mounted on a pivoting board and stand (5 gp). By pulling a long cord, the archer can set the targets to spinning, adding a new challenge to the task. 2 months spent solely in practice with these targets should learn to split the shaft. We offer TARGETS: As may allow an additional weapon proficiency, as per training rules (DMG, Ch. 8) TREE BED: Sleeping unprotected on the ground is not only dangerous, but also uncomfortable. We therefore offer a tree bed (8 gp). This gnomish contraption stretches a canvas sheet across a wooden frame that can be lashed in place upon most any tree. The tree bed provides a comfortable sleep removed from the dirty earth and away from the notice of roaming beasts. For an added 2 gp, we will include a pitched roof, turning the tree bed into a private tent for times of cold or rain. wt: 8 lb; not useful outside of trees TREE SEAT: Those unfamiliar with the ways of the wilderness commonly do not realize that a fortress lies in every tree. Our tree seat provides rangers a high and inconspicuous vantage for guarding in forested areas. Modeled after the crow’s nests aboard ships, the tree seat is the watchtower of the wood. A ranger in a tree seat almost invariably gets off the first shot or sends out the first warning call, and such folk are never garrotted. Assembled and mounted in minutes, the tree seat is constructed of sturdy duskwood and its steel claws will not slip. Not to be used 11 Ranger's Field on treants. (15 gp) requires Dex check to assemble correctly; provides watcher +3 to surprise roll and ground creatures a -3 to surprise roll; doubles range of vision WHISTLES AND ANIMAL CALLS: The forest is filled with innumerable birds and beasts, some of whom you may wish to attract, and some of whom you may wish to repel. We offer whistles and calls for both purposes. Those that attract creatures produce the sound pleasing to the creature’s ear (mating call or sound of prey); those that repel create an unpleasant sound (distress call or cry of enemy). All our animal calls cost 1 gp. Please specify which creature you wish to attract or repel: badger, bat, bear, boar, cat, deer, dog, eagle, hawk, horse, mountain lion, owl, rat, snake, sparrow, wolf, wren. 90% chance to attract/repel friendly creatures; 70% on indifferent; 50% on cautious; 30% on threatening; 10% on hostile; 0% if none in ½ mile radius 12 Pocket-Picking MINI-BLADE: This little blade—so small that it hides easily between the knuckles of a thief—has given the cutpurse his name. Masters of this tiny and keen blade can garner a day’s wages in a mere hour. Of course, novices may end up missing a finger or two. (1 sp) +5% to Pick Pockets; cannot be used with rosin, powder, or wired cane Thieves' Corner I like thieves. Rather a strange confession for a business owner, I realize, but I spent much of my adventuring life in the company of thieves—and I enjoyed it. Thieves are not necessarily unethical, they just restrict their ethical conduct to a specific group of persons. Of course, though I sell thieving aids, I cannot condone thievery against any but those with ill-gotten goods. For all thieving equipment, I require payment in full prior to delivery of materials. Some of these items are unavailable at particular stations due to legality. Powder vial— 15 applications: (5 cp). +2% to Pick Pockets used separately; +5 together; cannot be used with mini-blade or wired ROSIN AND POWDER: For thieves whose pocket-picking fingers do not seem sticky enough, rosin applied to the tips can boost sticking power. Those who have trouble slipping their hands into and out of purses and pockets might use our thieving powder to facilitate movement. Using rosin on the fingertips and powder on the edges produces a particularly useful combination. Rosin cube—100 applications: (1 sp); cane WIRED CANE: A rigid wire and leather wristband straps this cane to the wrist, allowing a pick-pocket to feign infirmity until close enough to strike. Then by bumping into the target, the cane-bearing hand can perform the pilfery and return to the cane before it is noticed. The wired cane’s handle contains a long-bored hole sized for coins of most types and most jewels. Ivory (10 gp); Bronze (5 gp); Oak (3 gp). +5% to Pick Pockets; cannot be used with mini-blade or powder Entering GAROTTES: Only the worst and most vile of thieves would garotte a 13 Thieves' Corner guard when a more cunning and less brutal method commends itself. Even so, I receive enough orders for these that I feel I must stock them. All my garottes are constructed of strong wire and hardwood handles—and all are damnably effective. (3 sp) Wt 1 lb; Sz S; Tp Special; SpF 2; Dmg 1d4/—(cannot be used on L); surprise provides +3 attack-roll bonus, no surprise provides -3 penalty; three consecutive hits kill victim GLASS CUTTER: Why spend precious minutes (if not longer) picking a rusty and complex lock when a window lies in reach? The diamond head of this glass-cutter is guaranteed to score even the thickest and most refined glass. Merely plant the sap-spong in the center of a pane of glass and score a circle around it. A gentle tap creates a hole from mouse-size to person-size. (2 gp) Requires Dex check at -2; failure means the cut section of window slipped and shattered HACKSAW: Where lockpicks require finesse and time, hacksaws only require time. All our blades are constructed by dwarven craftsmen and made of fire-hardened steel; our common blades can cut through anything made of steel or softer material. Our superior-grade blades, toothed with diamond chips, can cut any material of lesser hardness than diamond. Common: 5 gp; Superior: 20 gp. Either blade cuts one quarter-inch square per round; common blades last ten uses, superior last twenty. HINGE-REMOVING SET: Doors have two sides—if you can’t pick the lock, you might try removing the hinges. Our hinge-removing set contains all the tools you need to remove hinges on anything from jewelry boxes to castle keeps. (30 gp) Requires Dex check +1 round for small, 1 turn for door-size, and 10 turns for large hinges KEYMAKING SET: The most sophisticated lockpick is a duplicate of the key itself. Our keymaking set includes a wax pad for taking an impression of the original, a scribe for marking the metal stock, a set of blades and files for shaping the stock, and even a stack of metal stocks in small, medium, and large size and thickness. (40 gp) 14 Thieves' Corner Requires imprint of original, 1 day, and 5 Dex checks—three successes produce a working key LOCKPICKS: In addition to the assortment of wires, rods, and angled wrenches common to lockpick sets, our expanded version also contains a funnel, magnifying glass, hammer, oils, acids, chisels—even a listening cone. We have never received a complaint about the effectiveness of our sets—at least not from the buyers. +20% bonus to Open Locks; listening cone grants a +10% bonus to Detect Noise SLEEP GAS: A sleeping guard is undeniably nicer than a garotted one. We have three levels of potency for our sleeping gas, for small, medium, and large-size creatures. All come in sturdy stoppered flasks that break easily on impact. In liquid form when stoppered, these vials contain enough punch to instantly lay low one creature of the indicated size. Small: 5 gp/ flask; Man-size: 10 gp/flask; Large: 20 gp/flask. Effective 1d4+1 turns; useless against H or G sizes Silence DIVERSION DEVICES: Some thieves could not move silently if their lives depended on it—and typically their lives do. Therefore, we offer two devices to attract attention elsewhere while the thief moves not-so-silently. BAMSMACKS: Shipped from Shou Lung, these tiny segments of bamboo contain ordinary salt. When a string on the bamsmack is set on fire, the device splits apart with a loud smack. Bamsmacks are best used when thrown. (5 gp each) 15 Thieves' Corner GIGWHORLS: These tight-wound tops from Calimshan have a lock and spring mechanism. When thrown, they hit the ground and whirl in a loud, clattering fashion. (3 gp each) Provide a 1 round diversion; they work only once per encounter, only on creatures unaware of the user cloaks of elvenkind, these garments are not magical. Their neutral gray color and ingenious make their wearer blend readily into shadows. Small: gnomish design 10 gp. Large: 12 gp. +5% bonus to Hide in Shadows CLOAKS: Unlike comes from poor shoes. These soft leather shoes are coated with a thick, SILENT SHOES: Much stray sound stretchy substance from Chult. The silent shoes work well in thick forests as well as wet dungeons. All sizes: 10 gp. +4% bonus to Move Silently SILK BODYSUIT: Any noise not made by shoes must come from clothes. This black, tight-fitting bodysuit, made from a resilient fabric from Maztica, helps thieves hide in shadows. All sizes: 10 gp. +4% bonus to Move Silently the risk of revealing one’s place. This makeup will not harm the skin, as normal tar or rubbed charcoal may. One jar (25 applications): 3 gp. +2% bonus to Hide in Shadows WEAPON- One vial (25 applications): 3 gp. +5 bonus to Hide in Shadows BLACK: This compound does for dagger or sword what tar makeup does for one’s face. Unlike that of other companies, our weaponblack will not affect the sharpness of the weapon, nor is it flammable. 16 Hiding GNOMISH TAR MAKEUP: A cloaked body may still be given away by an uncovered face. Our tar makeup allows full vision and flexibility without Thieves' Corner Listening THIEVING HELMET: A perennial problem of being a thief is that any helmet must be removed to hear through doorways. Therefore, a gnomish inventor in Waterdeep devised this thieving helm, which not only protects the head, but also amplifies sound coming to a listener. They may look silly, but some of my friends swear by them. (10 gp) -1 bonus to AC; +5% to Detect Noise Climbing CLAMP GAUNTLETS AND CHISEL BOOTS: These ingenious items were invented by the same gnomish craftsman who made the thieving helmet. By means of narrow-tipped fingers and toes and a ratcheted clamp mechanism, in the gauntlets, thieves can find a handhold on most external wall surfaces: cut-stone, riverstone, or wood. Either size: 25 gp. +10 bonus to Climb Walls; -5 penalty to attack rolls; halves movement; cannot be used with other climbing gear CLIMBING IRONS: These bent rods strap comfortably to the legs, allowing a thief to sink the barbed ankles into most any wood surface. Traditionally used by lumbermen, climbing irons also work very effectively on the corners of wooden buildings. Of course, though they aid climbing, they hamper getaways— I’ve seen many a thief running bow-legged from a crime scene to avoid bloodying his ankles. +7 bonus to Climb Walls; -3 penalty to normal movement until removed ROPE SET: Our rope set not only includes 200 yards of high-quality, triple-stranded silk rope of elven manufacture, but also two foldable grapples and the spikes and pulleys needed for serious climbing. All of this comes in a lightweight pack. (40 gp) +10 bonus to Climb Walls; cannot be used with other climbing gear; total set weighs 5 lb; pack weighs ½ lb 17 Thieves' Corner SPIDER POLES: This odd and gangly assortment of metal poles can be collapsed into a small, lightweight bundle. When unfolded, however, the spider-poles can be snapped variously together to form a semirigid ladder or articulated frame for scaling walls. Pay careful attention when you unfold the spider poles, though, or you may never remember how to collapse them. +10 bonus to Climb Walls; requires Dex check for assembly/fold up; cannot be used with other climbing equipment Escaping BLADEBOOTS: Captured thieves are typically stripped of their weapons, but not of their shoes. If a thief has a shoe for a weapon, odds for escape improve significantly. Solid leather construction, a broad steel blade, and a heel-click trigger mechanism add kick to any escape. (15 gp) Wt 2 lbs; Sz S; Tp P; Speed 4; Dmg 1d6/1d6+1 EARBLADE: Though many thieves carry these handy gadgets, most hope never to use them. The earblade is an incredibly keen blade mounted on a spring hinge and resting unobtrusively behind the ear. The earblade’s sole use is to deeply score a nooseline placed over a thief’s head. Thus, when the gibbet block is dropped, the rope will snap and the thief can escape. Since none can guess which side the noose will be placed on, most thieves buy two of these. (1 sp) 15% chance of discovery; 50% chance of success FILES: These thin and sturdy files can be easily sewn into the hems of clothing before any thievery is attempted. Then if captured, the thief has a ready means for making an exit from his cell. These files are not to be swallowed and regurgitated under any circumstance. Cut through ¼ inch square of iron or lesser material in 1 turn MASKS: Arguably the best way to escape pursuit is to be unrecognizable. We stock only the typical black thieving masks, but can special order face dressings that, in dim light, disguise the wearer entirely. Specify type and allow six months for special orders. 40% chance of disguise, or +3 to Disguise proficiency, whichever is greater 18 Thieves' Corner POISON: Live thieves are carted off or slain; dead thieves are left to the mortician or the ravens. By drinking two vials of this mild poison (one vial for demihumans or weak humans), a thief can all but stop his heart and breathing for 30 minutes. Most awake thereafter in simpler hands from which to escape, though some have come to buried in pine boxes. Actual duration is 1d20+10 rounds SPOILERS: When fleeing from the scene of a crime, one need not rely on skill alone to escape harm’s way. By tossing spikey caltrops onto a rough path or marbles on a smooth floor one can markedly slow a pursuit. Aniseed can throw dogs off a thief’s scent, and a field of snap-traps can deter pursuers of any type. When fleeing with a bag of gold beneath one arm, have a bag of spoilers beneath the other and you’ll surely get away. CALTROPS (BAG OF 100): 2 gp Pursuers move at 1/3 speed or save vs. paralyzation; successful save halts movement and does 1d4 damage MARBLES (BAG OF 100): 8 sp Pursuers move at ½ speed or Dex check for slipping; failed check means they fall for 1 round ANISEED (VIAL): 1 gp Stops dogs 1d4+1 hours; successful save vs. poison lets trained dog pursue after 1d4+1 turns SNAPTRAPS (BAG OF 100): 5 gp Pursuers move at ½ speed or Dex check; failure means pursuer steps on trap and takes 1d4 damage Scams BEGGING FAKERY: Despite the protestations of thieves’ guilds throughout Toril, I refuse to stock materials expressly meant for the cruel and unimaginative scam of begging fakery. Granted, those bent on schemes that take bread from the mouths of the truly needy will buy crutches, bandages, and so forth from our medical section, but I can little stop such reprobates. DISAPPEARING INK: For thieves who make their way among wealthy folk, disappearing ink is as indispensable as a mini-blade to a cutpurse. What better way to entrap an unwary businessman than to sign him to 19 Thieves' Corner a contract from which your signature will disappear? We carry all varieties of ink—disappearing within the hour, day, week, or month, and ink that is invisible until heated over a candle. Please specify type at ordering. Black or red: 5 gp. 10% chance of failure DISGUISE: Our costume kits contain everything a thief needs to slip by unobtrusively. A vial of tree sap allows the goat-hair moustache or beard to be easily attached. The soft felt hat can assume many shapes and the linen coif doubles as a decorative hood. A coal pad darkens skin and adds dramatic shadows, while the chalk stick lightens and highlights skin. The pack even includes a wad of clay that can be shaped and colored to make a false nose or chin, or higher cheekbones. (20 gp) +3 to Disguise proficiency GAMES: The gaming table has witnessed some of the most daring and legendary scams of thieving history. For the enterprising game player, we offer marked card decks (3 gp), dice weighted for high or low rolls (5 gp), and pebbles and shells with roller pockets (3 gp). +3 to Gaming proficiency if used appropriately SALVES AND MEDICINALS: Because I will not condone the sale of false cures to those with real afflictions, our liniments and salves purport instead to provide enhanced felicity to native abilities. We therefore supply snake-oil salesmen with stoppered jars purporting to “liven reflexes,” “improve stamina,” “enlarge muscles,” “induce hair growth,” “increase intelligence,” “ remove liver spots,” “enhance common sense.” Each bottle comes with complex instructions for application, and minuscule evidence of effectiveness. Successful wisdom check lets thief sell salve for 1d10 gp; 5% chance per usage of temporary placebo effect, improving related ability (if any) 1 point for 1d3 days. 20 Bards' Emporium When I was young, I thought music fairly useless. It did not stop hunger, grant warmth, save life, cover nudity, quench thirst, turn rain, or perform any other worthwhile service, as far as I could tell. I was at that time too young and too practical to admit “soothing the heart” or “rousing the spirit” as true justifications for music. However, years spent at the mercy of the wandering trail and the storm-prone sky taught me to value a cheery song even above a hot meal or warm bed. Therefore, I offer only the finest quality instruments, each of them inspected and approved by the Waterdhavian Council of Musicians, Instrument Makers, and Choristers. As well as offering the instruments themselves, we allow special requests for blessing by the priests of Milil at double the instrument’s list cost and twice the ordering time. When ordering instruments for ensembles, remember that instruments crafted in disparate geographical or cultural areas may not be compatible in pitch. But bards do not live by instruments alone. I am pleased to also offer many of the accoutrements that bards need for the recitation of verse and the execution of drama. Read through the section that follows the instruments and discover there the many helps we provide for working wonder in the hearts of audiences. Common Strings BANDORE (PANDORA): This bass-range instrument can reach low notes that other citterns cannot. It has a rich and mellow tone the girds up even the quietest of voices. As well as being ornamental, the bandore’s scalloped sides are said to enrich the timbre. (65 gp) CITTERN: These pear-shaped variations on the common yarting have four sets of paired strings that produce rich tones. The Patriarch of Song in Waterdeep says, “Citterns add spice to peasant music.” (65 gp) 21 DULCIMER: In the frosty lands of Damara, these instruments have become a favorite for hearthside entertainment. All our Damaran craftsmen use solid spruce sounding boards and oak hammers. Full-size: 60 gp; Half-size: 45 gp. LUTE: Built by the craftsmen of exotic Calimshan, these round-backed instruments have become a fixture in royal courts as far north as Sundabar. Our lutes contain doubled strings for a fuller sound. The pegs allow for easy tuning, and the round back rests most comfortably against the stomach. Chitarrone: 50 gp; theorbo: 45 gp; mandora: 40 gp; common: 35 gp. Bards' Emporium MANDOLIN: Another fine product from Calimshan, these small, pear-shaped instruments produce a delicate, fluttering sound when strummed for accompaniment. They also make excellent solo instruments. 40 gp. PSALTERY: The music of this plucked dulcimer fills the houses of peasants and the castles of kings from Narfell to Cormyr. Crafted by skilled bards in Selgaunt, our psalteries are excellent instruments for novices and masters. Triangular: 65 gp; Square: 60 gp. YARTING: Whether half-elf or human and whether in the wilds of Icewind Dale or the sprawling hordelands, yarting music is the bard’s staple diet. All our yartings feature sturdy spruce construction, a fretted fingerboard, coiled steel strings, and a leather case. All sizes: 40 gp. ZITHER: With all the clarity and beauty of a common dulcimer and the flexibility of a yarting, the zither is fast becoming a fixture in the streets and courts of the land. Its lower strings are fretted to allow the left hand to stopper them, and the upper strings, tuned in fourths, can be plucked by the right thumb. The resulting music suits rigorous peasant dances as well as recitation of ancient lore. (65 gp) Elite Strings HARP: Our harps vary in size, shape, and material. We offer full-scale harps of wood (75 gp), half-scale harps of wood (50 gp) or silver (120 gp) and quarter-scale harps of wood (30 gp) or silver (75 gp). All produce excellent quality sound. We bring wood harps from Impiltur, and silver from Selgaunt. LYRE: These ancient squarish instruments are perhaps the most portable ones we offer. They provide excellent background sound to epics, as they have for ages. (40 gp) 22 Bards' Emporium HARPSICHORD: No manor house or castle would be complete without a harpsichord. This large and versatile instrument, when played by one or two keyboardists, produces a cheerful jangling that will fill any room. But, when notes come few and slow it creates a sober and pensive effect. All our harpsichords come from a gnomish master in Selgaunt, and all must be special ordered. Prices are highly individualized, according to materials required. VIOLIN: Our violins are constructed in two cities of high culture: Waterdeep, Selgaunt. Elves particularly love violin music, and many of our craftsmen are elven. Even our lowest-price violins (65 gp) produce mellow tones and come with a leather case. Our masters-quality violins must be special ordered from a specific craftsman, and thus range in price and availability. This grandfather to the modern violin is the instrument of choice for the lively music of the peasant folk. We stock both two- and three-stringed rebecs, all of which are crafted in Selgaunt by guild craftsmen. (55 gp) VIOL: These deeply resonant, 6-stringed cousins of the violin work well alone, or can flesh out a larger ensemble of instruments. With melancholy music they are matchless. Favored by dwarven players for their dark tones and mournful voices, our viols come from the same craftsmen who create our violins. (70 gp) REBEC: common longhorn, vertical tubes of varying height. The rich wood tones of the birdpipe are saidrich wood tones of the birdpipe are said by some to charm even ferociousby some to charm even ferocious animals. (20 gp)animals. (20 gp) Winds BIRDPIPE: Cousin to the the birdpipe produces sound through many 23 Bards' Emporium FANFARE HORN: These long and elegant brasswork horns produce a most strident and heroic tone. Their conic simplicity makes them perfect for banners of state. (35 gp) HORN: Our horns are made of finest material (brass, bronze, horn, or shell) and include beeswax for tuning slides and oil for valves. In addition to the valveless trumpets traditional to the courts of kings, we offer other, more versatile horns on these pages. Common trumpet: 40 gp. GLAUR: This valved horn has a versatility that other trumpets cannot begin to match. Its curved shape makes its tone a brash, metallic roar that stirs the heart of anyone. By blowing continuously while operating the valves, swooping pitch changes occur, to great effect. Glaur are available in silver (120 gp), electrum (250 gp), and brass (75 gp). H UNTING HORN: These small, curved horns produce a loud clarion call that can carry as far as two miles. We offer hunting horns crafted of wood (20 gp), brass (35 gp), shell (35 gp), and even horn (30 gp). LONGHORN: Longhorns produce perhaps the purest, most lyric tones of any instruments. Their simple elegance, playability, and portability have made them rival the yarting in popularity. The treble variety (15 gp) creates very high and piercing tones, like those of birds chirping. The common longhorn covers the mid to upper tones and comes in brass (15 gp), silver (35 gp), wood (10 gp), and bamboo (15 gp). Tenor longhorns are available only by special order. SACKBUT: This odd brass horn produces a variety of low tones through use of a sliding mechanism. The sliding action can also produce a very vulgar slurring sound, made loud and blatty by the broad bell at the end. (45 gp) 24 Bards' Emporium SHAWM: This double-reed instrument creates an exotically textured sound. When played poorly, the instrument buzzes like a large insect, but in the hands of a master, the shawm has the clear, melancholic voice of migrating geese. Either way, shawms should be played out of doors. (22 gp) SHORTHORN: Child of the longhorn, the shorthorn can achieve high and piercing tones of remarkable clarity. Though the range of this instrument is limited, due to its size, it is sure to be heard in any ensemble due to its birdlike voice. The shorthorn is an easy instrument to learn for those proficient on the longhorn. (15 gp) SONGHORN: This instrument has a mellower, less strident tone than its sister, the longhorn. Its beauty is very clear in alto and tenor ranges where longhorns gutter. (15 gp) ZULKOON: Zulkoon are portable organs. By means of a bellows contraption that lies upon the ground and is pumped by the player’s feet, air is forced over what amount to a set of odd organ pipes. The constant flow of air from the zulkoon produces a loud drone that underlies the other tones. (95 gp) 25 THELARR: A kind of rustic longhorn, the thelarr or whistlecane is a dried swamp reed cut to produce a specific pitch. The dry fibers within a whistlecane produce a buzzing sound. Several pipes (and several players) can produce melodies and chords. Whistlecanes come individually (6 gp) or in complete sets (25 gp). CHIMES: The sound of chimes, whether the patter of small chimes or the somber ring of large chimes, always stirs the hearts of listeners. Our suppliers create chimes ranging from full racks (75 gp) to small, hand-held sets (5 gp). Chimes must therefore be special ordered. HAND-DRUM: All our hand-drums are constructed of solid (unspliced) ash, ironwood, or cherry, and include a shoulder strap. They work well to mark the rhythm of ensemble play, to alert trail mates of danger, or to accompany wild tales by the campfire. (20 gp) RATTLE: A favorite of children across Toril, gourd rattles have many uses in ensemble play as well. All our rattles come from exotic Calimshan, Bards' Emporium Percussion from Semphar, fashioned by the masters of the plains. (12 gp) and bear beautiful tracery patterns painted by the skillful folk of that land. We stock small (5 gp), moderate (7 gp), and large (10 gp) rattles. TANTAN: This jangling hoop helps to emphasize rhythms in ensemble play, and adds spice to campfire dances. Our tantans come from the long trade routes TOCKEN: These carved wooden bells lie upon a crossbeam and are struck by a hammer (they have no clappers). Tocken thus create a very pleasant ringing tone that contains the dark subtleties of the wood itself. All sizes: 25 gp. WARGONG: These broad, heavy disks of copper produce a sudden, thunderous sound when struck heavily, and a sustained rumble when mallets roll upon the surface. Our wargongs have sounded from high courts to battlefields; chains of them send signals from outpost to outpost across hundreds of miles. Because our craftsmen for these instruments reside in Shou Lung, and because each wargong is an unique work of art, wargongs must be special ordered. Prices vary with availability. 26 Bards' Emporium Other Equipment BAMSMACKS AND SMOKERS: Long favored by bards of all stripes, our bamsmacks and smokers add a flair to any performance. The bamsmacks are made from Malatran bamboo sections filled with salt, and they create a jarring smack when set aflame. The smokers are merely finger-sized chunks of incense that belch smoke when thrown into a brazier. When tied together and thrown into flame, bamsmacks and smokers create an effect like wizards’ magic. Bamsmack: 5 gp; smoker: 3 gp. can be used to create a diversion or simulate magic BLADDERS: What child is happier than one with a full bladder? These pig bladders can be blown up to the size of a man’s head. (As anyone knows, bladders vary in size.) They can be attached to a stick or string, filled with water and thrown, released to sputter about the room, or even punctured to produce a loud pop. Children need no prompting to come up with devious uses. Bladders (5): 1 gp. again, useful for diversions LADDER OF ELMINSTER: Among the simplest and most enchanting of tumbling accoutrements is the ladder of Elminster. By holding the top of the rails and leaning back, a dexterous bard can walk up the ladder, balancing the weight of it by drawing the ladder toward the chest. Then stepping over the top rung, the bard can descend down the other side. We offer the ladder in the beginner 5-foot height (5 sp), as well as the master 8-foot (7 gp), and the mage 10-foot (8 gp) ladders. requires Tumbling proficiency and 1 day practice; regular falling damage applies JESTER CLOTHING: A fool is known by his clothing, if by nothing else. Our jester clothing is one-size fits all: small jesters swim comically in the clothes, while massive fellows strain the seams—jester clothes are better when they don’t fit! This outfit comes with a floppy three-cornered hat with bells on each tip (3 gp), a star-shaped collar also with bells (1 gp), a poufy shirt of satin (10 gp), white gloves (7 sp), bunchy pantaloons (8 gp), bright stockings (8 sp), and buffoonish shoes (12 gp). 27 Bards' Emporium Each piece comes in red, yellow, green, blue, black, or white. Best used with makeup. Set: 25 gp JUGGLABLES: Who can resist a juggling bard? We offer a wide variety of jugglables, each in sets of 3: balls of leather (5 sp), bean-bags (7 cp), clubs (1 gp), juggling knives (7 cp), plates of wood (4 sp), and stars of brass (2 gp). Our juggling knives have dull edges so that they will not slice off a novice finger. due to optimal size and weight, use of these provides a +1 to Juggling proficiency when used LEAPING LEVER: With this handy contraption, bards can soar through the air with the birds. By having a hefty bard (or two) leap from a height onto the short end of the lever, a bard standing upon the long end can be propelled to great heights or distances. The fulcrum is lightweight and thus easily carried, and can be used with the provided lever or another sturdy board. requires 1 day of practice; doubles height or length attained through Jumping proficiency (with running start) up to 3 times PC’s height vertically or 12 times PC’s height horizontally 28 MASK: Our masks produce a change of character and are fitted with conic mouthpieces to actually increase the actor’s loudness. We offer traditional comedy and tragedy masks in finely carved and painted spruce (5 gp each) as well as a black pantomime mask (1 gp). In addition we sell the following at 8 gp each: bear, cat, death, disease, dog, fate, ghost, hawk, king, melancholy, orc, merchant, mouse, noble, peasant, queen, rage, slave, snake, and trickster. Special orders require 6 months for completion. suitable masks add +1 to Disguise proficiency, but only at 20 feet or more MAKEUP: An aged sage once said, “Actors without makeup seem only walking spoons upon the stage.” Our makeup kit includes coal dust and tar for blackening features and adding dramatic lines; cochineal powder from Maztica for reddening lips and cheeks; flour for lightening features; oil to add gloss; goat-hair mustaches and beards; blonde, brown, black, and gray wigs; resin for hair application; skin putty to lengthen noses or add circles beneath eyes; and a slippery liquid useful for washing off all substances. provides a +2 to Disguise proficiency when used PLATE SPINNER: Among the easiest but most impressive tricks of balance is plate spinning. We supply 8-inch long pins for spinning plates (3 cp each), unbreakable plates of wood set with a minuscule divot for easy spinning (2 sp each), and even a drilled stand that can hold four spinning plates at once (1 sp). provides a +2 to Juggling proficiency when used Bards' Emporium character types: bard, crone, cutpurse, farmer, herdsman, king, maiden, mage, merchant, mother, nobleman, orc, peasant, priest, prince, princess, queen, skeleton, slave, and soldier (7 gp each). We also offer a magnificent dragon puppet made of silk from Shou Lung, and requiring three hands to operate (15 gp). PRESTIDIGI- TATION: Bards need not know magic to amaze a crowd, for sleight of hand can transform confusion into magic. We offer all manner of devices for deluding an audience: marked cards (3 gp), card strung together (4 gp), hollow-topped hats (3 gp), pocketed scarves (1 gp), foldable canes (4 gp), flowering rods (4 gp), and retractable knives (3 gp). each requires 1 day practice and a Dex check SPEAKING HORN: Even for a popular bard, an appreciative audience can grow only so large due to the limits of the human voice. However, with this polished cone, a bard can send his or her voice far and clear. Available in rigid birchwood (3 gp) for urban bards, and leather (5 gp) with removable iron hoops for easy folding and storing. lets speaker be heard in a 60 degree cone in length 10 yards times the speaker’s Con PUPPETS/MARIONETTES: A set of puppets or marionettes can transform a single bard into an entire theatrical STILTS: For bards who hope for higher occupations, we supply stilts of all lengths. We offer both simple stilts with poles, handles that run behind the arms, and complex stilts that strap to the calves. (Both are the same price.) Either type uses light- troupe or transform an existing troupe into an army. We offer both puppets and marionettes in the following weight, sturdy pine. The heights we carry are 1 ft (2 gp), 2 ft (3 gp), 4 ft (4 gp), 8 ft (6 gp), 12 ft (8 gp), and 20 ft (12 gp). Greater heights can be 29 Bards' Emporium special ordered. requires one hour of practice for each foot off the ground; slows movement by half; requires Dex check each round; regular falling damage applies TIGHTROPE: All humans dream of flying, and perhaps those who walk the tightrope come as near to it as anyone. Our tightrope (6 gp) is a banded steel cable that comes with a thick ring. By tying one end of the cable to a tree or building and attaching the ring near the other end of the cable, the remaining line can be wrapped around another tree and cinched tightly. Thus, our tightrope can be quickly set up in most any location. requires Tightrope Walking proficiency; regular falling damage applies WALKING WHEEL AND BALL: A common sight in the magnificent marketplaces of Calimshan, the walking wheel and walking ball have only recently entered the streets of the Heartlands. The wheel (4 gp) is simply a broad steel hoop with countless uses: it can be held up and jumped through, rolled along the ground with a stick, stood atop and turned slowly beneath the feet, crawled inside to roll head-over-heels down a hill, and so forth. The walking ball (7 gp) is a 15-pound sphere of granite atop which bards can learn to balance, walk, and even run. requires Tumbling proficiency 30 Priests' Alcove Despite the obvious fact that priestly folk concern themselves more often with spiritual rather than material matters, priests often require as many physical implements as fighters. Most of these accoutrements are specific to a faith, or are large structures (such as altars) that we obviously could not carry. Even so, I am proud to offer the finest selection of equipment for the adventuring priest, including all clerical items common to the more established and materially oriented faiths of Toril. In addition to tools of the faith, I supply implements to help the healing priest, and components necessary for all the major spells. Note that none of these items carry clerical blessing or sanctification when purchased. Items ALTAR CASE: For many of the established and churchly faiths of Toril, altars (when sanctified) act as powerful tools for priests. When setting off on adventures, however, clerics must commonly leave this tool behind. linen (15 gp), velvet (30 gp), silk (35 gp), and gold brocade (40 gp). For an additional 5 gp, any material but the brocade can be dyed red, blue, yellow, green, or brown. We also supply a 2' by 2' cloth for our altar cases (3 gp). In response to this dilemma, I have commissioned artisans of fine wood and stone to create altar cases—narrow boxes that open up to form traveling altars. Within each box is room for small holy implements and vessels, an altar cloth, and a compact prayer book. By blessing these boxes and properly provisioning them, priests can take their temple with them. Spruce: 15 gp; Granite: 40 gp. ASPERGILLS: One common means by which priests dispense the power of their god is through the sprinkling of holy water. Our chambered aspergill can carry up to one pint of holy water. By swinging or whirling the aspergill on its when blessed and assembled, provides a +1 bonus to turn/control undead rolls in 10-foot radius; wood weights 5 lb, stone weighs 40 lb. ALTAR CLOTHS: As powerful tools of faith, altars deserve fitting adornment. We offer a 6' by 14' altar cloth that can drape or be folded to fit smaller altars. Our altar cloths are white and come in the following materials: chain, a priest can disperse holy water farther than with a vial, whether doing so in the sanctuary or on the battlefield. Gold: 45 gp; Silver: 20 gp. Increases by 10 yards the radius affected by spells using holy water 31 Priests' Alcove BRAZIERS: As ancient as faith itself, braziers serve the trifold role of providing heat, supplying light, and consuming incense and other aromatics cast into them. We offer traditional 6-foot-diameter temple braziers and 4-foot-diameter chapel braziers, as well as field braziers, which are 18 inches in diameter. Though not ornate like the large and mid-sized braziers, the field brazier can be easily strapped to a pack and even double as a buckler for fighting priests. Large: gold—110 gp, silver—70 gp, bronze—30 gp; Medium: gold—70, silver—30 gp, bronze—17 gp; Field: silver—15 gp; bronze—4 gp. When used provides 10% reduction in spell failure percentage for spells using incense; can function in all ways as a buckler CANDLES: Though most folk use candles merely for light, priests use them as powerful tools of faith. Our altar candles are 3 inches in diameter and come in lengths from 1 to 6 feet (4 gp per foot). As well as accenting holy sites, the 6-foot altar candles can burn for weeks on end. We also offer 8-hour vigil candles (10 gp each) which, when burned through the night beside an injured person, work medicinal effects through their incense. Our 12-hour candles (4 sp each) sell more than any other variety and, for an additional gp can be inscribed to indicate the passage of hours and half-hours. Temples of Lathander use two 6-foot altar candles per fortnight; a vigil candle allows 1 extra point of healing to creatures in a 10-foot radius if tended for 8 hours by a wakeful priest CANDLESTICKS: Among the most prominent and ubiquitous of the temple’s accoutrements are candlesticks, of all varieties and types. Our gold (20 gp) and silver (12 gp) foot-tall candlesticks are crafted by Waterdhavian smiths and can accommodate candles from 1 to 3 inches in diameter. For gods who love light, we carry 6-candle candelabra in gold (35 gp) and silver (20 gp), as well as 12 -candle versions (gold—45; silver—25 gp). Finally, we offer hand-held candlesticks (gold—3 gp; silver—5 sp) and glass-hooded candlesticks for use in windy conditions (gold—7 gp; silver—1 gp). hooded candlesticks provide a 90% chance per round to stay lit in strong winds, 50% in gales. 32 Priests' Alcove CENSER: The censer is a portable incense burner common to priests of both temple and trail. Our censers come in gold (5 gp), silver (3 gp), and brass (1 gp), all of which are ornamentally inlaid and can burn up to 6 ounces of incense at a time. While the portable brazier provides the adventuring priest with a stable base for incense burning, the censer allows that base to move. +10 yards (if applicable) to range of any incense-using spell; when carried burning, gives party -3 penalty to surprise and negates NPC/monster surprise HOLY SYMBOLS: Most every faith has its symbol of divinity, a physical reminder of a power that transcends the physical. These symbols are critical to most priest spells, and undead of all sorts recognize their power when presented by a believing hand. The following holy symbols, though of fine craftsmanship, are neither blessed nor authorized by the corresponding church. Even so, those church officials who have contacted us have expressed only appreciation for making their symbols available among the people. All our holy symbols come in 8 ounce gold (10 gp), silver (4 gp), or bronze (1 gp) sizes that attach easily to garments or may be hand-held for presentation. Specify faith when ordering. must be blessed by church for spell-use/ turning 33 Priests' Alcove RAZOR AND CAP: Among the most recognizable marks of many priesthoods is the shaving of one’s crown. Sadly, adventuring or cloistered priests must shave their own pates and thus end up with oblong or star-shaped patterns. Our razor and cap set solves this problem. The sturdy leather cap, fashioned in Ordulin, fits any size head by using the numerous buttons along the front. Whatever the size, the cap creates a perfect circle for shaving. The accompanying razor is made of the finest steel and folds neatly into a leather case. (4 gp) Razor: Wt. ½ lb; Sz S; Tp S; Spd Fctr 2; Dmg 1d4/1d6; cap provides no AC reduction S NUFFING BELL: A common sight across Toril, our snuffing bells are large enough to douse even the largest altar candles. The tip also holds an oiled wick for lighting candles, and the small blade positioned between the wick and bell arms even the youngest acolyte to defend the faith. (6 gp) Snuffing Bell: Wt 4 lb; Sz M; Tp P; Spd Fctr 7; Dmg 1d4/1d4 Incenses Far more than merely the perfume of the gods, incense has countless roles to play in the priestly lifestyle—not the least of which is to bear the prayers of the faithful to their god. We offer both combustible and non-combustible incense in the following varieties. All prices are for a bundle of 12 sticks, the equivalent of 12 oz of non-combustible incense; each stick lasts about half an hour. sticks can be burned simultaneously unless otherwise noted; no game effects are cumulative AIR: Facilitates casting of all air elemental spells.

Of course, none of the items I sell are themselves magical, but I do stock everything a wizard needs for a complete research laboratory. Though I do not sell spell books and other magical tomes (for obvious reasons), I do offer a referral network by which wizards may track down useful tomes in other mages’ libraries. Needless to say, I refuse to transport magical tomes between wizards, and many mages— even if they have the requisite books—are unwilling to let their libraries be perused by others. Successful searches merely provide the mage’s name and location. Working an arrangement with the named wizard lies entirely in the hands of the requester. Please allow six months for a book search. Items ALEMBIC: This glass device— consisting of a pear-shaped cucurbit, venting cap, and round receiver—has become the universal distilling mechanism. Our alembics come with a metal stand, but the burner must be purchased separately. (10 gp) 3 alembics are required for a complete laboratory APRONS: In a lab stocked with acid, bat guano, and mercury, a good apron can avert death as well as embarrassing stains. Our clay-steeped canvas aprons cover the body from neck to ankle and resist stains, acids, and fires (4 gp). We also offer a leather apron with an attached beard pocket and hood to protect decades of hair growth. (10 gp) +1 bonus to saves rolled for fire or acid attacks; item saves: acid 9, magical fire 6, normal fire 4; 3 aprons of the first type are requisite for a complete lab ASTROLABE AND ARMILLARY SPHERE: Though much of magic draws its power from the world of matter, many mages turn their eyes also to the quintessent heavens. For those who have only a passing interest in the stars, we offer a solid bronze astrolabe (8 gp) crafted in Sembia and useful for tracking the sun, planets, and stars across the heavens. Our full armillary (60 gp) provides a near-flawless model of the principal celestial circles. 1 astrolabe is required for a complete laboratory BAGS: We stock bags of all sizes and materials, from large and tight-woven grain sacks to small and loose knit steeping sacks. All weave types cost the same and are available in any size. We also provide water-tight leather bags in each size (doubles cost), bags that work 39 Wizards' Laboratory especially well for fermentation processes. Please specify material type when ordering from the following sizes —Tea: 1 cp; Hand: 3 cp, Loaf: 6 cp; Flour: 8 cp; Grain: 1 sp. 5 of each size are requisite for a complete lab BALANCE: For truly accurate measurement of weight, our tabletop balance is without compare. The sturdy steel frame can handle weights up to 50 lb. Comes with weights that range from 10 lb down to 1/16 oz. Accurate to the weight of a cricket’s leg. (30 gp) 1 is needed for a complete laboratory BEAKERS, VIALS, GLASS TUBING: All our laboratory glassware is made of finest-quality, fire-hardened glass, crafted in Urmlaspyr by members of the glass-blowers guild. Vials (1 sp each) fit easily in vial racks, and are perfect for experimenting with small quantities of liquid or powder. Our beakers come in small (5 sp), medium (1 gp), and large (3 gp) sizes. We stock glass tubing in two-foot lengths (2 sp) that can be cut to size or fired and bent. We carry one specialized piece of glass tubing—the distilling coil (5 gp), which is fully compatible with our other tubing. Of course, we also carry corks for all of these containers, offering whole stoppers (5 cp), stoppers drilled for tubing (8 cp), and corks meant to connect two sections of tubing (1 sp). 18 vials; 6 beakers of each size; 10 two-foot lengths of tubing, 3 distilling coils, and 18 corks of each type are required for a complete lab. BELLOWS: An efficient set of bellows can double the heat in a furnace without adding any more fuel. We offer small and large bellows constructed of supple calf-skin and hardwood, with a brass nozzle. Small: 5 gp; Large: 10 gp. 1 of each size required for a complete laboratory BRAZIERS AND BURNERS: Though not as controllable as ovens, braziers supply quick or long-term heat to vials and beakers without removing them from sight. Our small bronze brazier (5 gp) holds enough coals to heat a large beaker, whereas our large brazier can heat an entire laboratory. Our burners (5 sp) are circular slabs of 40 hard wax in which linen rags are coiled to act as wicks. These slabs fit easily into our small braziers and provide constant, low-level heat. 3 small braziers and 9 burners are requisite for a complete laboratory BURETTE: This thin glass tube is made under the strictest supervision of glass-blower guildsmen of Urmlaspyr. Each is individually graduated by a skilled alchemist to assure proper fluid measure. Our burettes come with a cork stop-cock and a bronze stand. (15gp) 2 burettes are requisite for a complete laboratory CABINETRY AND TABLES: Absolutely essential to the well-stocked laboratory, equipment and chemical storage cabinets can make the difference between order and chaos in experimentation. Our complete cabinet (50 gp) contains shelves to accommodate all sizes of jars, as well as smaller cabinets for light-sensitive materials. We also offer braces (2 gp per pair) and fine hardwood planking (1 sp per board foot) for building your own shelves. Our tables (50 gp) are broad and sturdy, with black granite tops that can withstand great heat and strong acids. For an added fee of 5 gp we can shorten the legs of tables on a special-order basis for gnome, dwarf, or halfling mages. equivalent Wizards' Laboratory Complete laboratories must have at least two tables, 1 cabinet, and 2 ten-foot shelves—or the CANDLES: These mundane items are among the most versatile tools in the lab. Those of you new to the laboratory will quickly learn that candles can provide far more than light. We offer timekeeping candles (1 gp), which are notched to indicate the passage of hours and half-hours; incense candles (1 gp), which can clear foul odors from the laboratory; vial heaters (1 sp), which burn long and steadily; and typical tapers (1 sp), which provide excellent light for reading. All candles come in red, black, yellow, or uncolored versions. 30 of each type are requisite for a complete laboratory CENTRIFUGE: A critical tool for drawing out precipitants, this modern contraption works on the same principle as the mill wheel. By applying pressure to foot-pedals near the floor, the weighted horizontal wheel is set in motion. When stoppered vials are set in the wheel and spun, 41 Wizards' Laboratory heavy solids fall from the liquid to the base of the vial. (25 gp) 1 is required for a complete laboratory CLAY: Amongst highly reactive compounds, a nonreactive substance is most welcome. When kept moist, clay can be flattened into a pad to support hot containers, molded onto a mage’s face to protect against burns or acid, or even shaped to provide a temporary joint between glass tubes. (1 gp per pound) 20 pounds are required for a complete laboratory COAL: We offer clean- and hot- burning anthracite coal (1 gp per pound) in blocks for use in braziers and other non-vented fires as well as the more common bituminous coal (1 gp per 20 pounds), which must be vented. 10 pounds of anthracite and 200 pounds of bituminous are required for a complete laboratory DISSECTION INSTRUMENTS: Not among the more pleasant of wizardly duties, dissection is often necessary to acquire rare and unpurchasable spell components. Some (odd) mages also use our dissection instruments to study the inner workings of the bodies of beasts. (I have even known a few scoundrels who have laid open a human corpse in similar fashion—but I quickly set the constabulary on them.) Our dissection kit includes all the knives, pins, sponges, blotters, lenses, and so forth you need to make quick work of this unpleasant task. (10 gp) 1 is required for a complete laboratory EASELS: Our adjustable easels are sturdy enough to serve as sloped writing- tables and large enough to support even the widest slates. Broad feet and four-legged construction make them stable in any arrangement. (40 gp) 1 is required for a complete laboratory FILES: This assortment of 18 wood and metal files would make a thief proud. These work perfectly for shaving small measures of solid materials for components. This set of files comes with a leather satchel. (10 gp) 1 set is required for a complete laboratory 42 Wizards' Laboratory FILTER: We offer sheets of gauze or coarse-screen straw mesh (1 sp per square foot) that can be cut to fit most any laboratory setup. For those occasions in which a tighter filter is needed, we offer linen screen (1 sp per square foot) or silken screen (1 gp per square foot). 10 square feet of each type is needed for a complete laboratory GLOVES: In my many travels, I met more than a few wizards who had lost a finger to acids or knives in their labs. Contact poisons provide another reason to wear good gloves. Our clay-steeped canvas gloves (2 gp) guard against most substances. Our steel-reinforced leather gloves (5 gp) provide as much protection as a gauntlet, without the accompanying weight. 2 pairs of each type are needed for a complete laboratory HEAT MATS: Our heat mats (5 cp) are quilted in Sembia and can absorb lead-melting heat levels before bursting into flame. We also offer pads made of a fibrous white crystalline material (5 gp) recently discovered in the Osraun Mountains and capable of withstanding any heat. (I knew one mage who constructed a suit of the stuff before descending to the Abyss. He returned untouched by the fire, but died shortly afterward with a hacking cough.) 10 of the first type are required for a complete laboratory H OUR / MINUTE GLASS: Closely tracking time is crucial to the success of chemical research. We offer various sizes of time glasses: half minute (5 gp), minute (3 gp), five minute (7 gp), ten minute (10 gp), hour (7 gp), and two hour (15 gp) glasses. All of these timepieces are cast and ornately painted in Calimshan, then filled with precise sand measures in Waterdeep. Half-minute, minute, five minute, and hour glasses are required for a complete laboratory ICE CHEST: Strange though it may seem, some alchemical supplies keep better in cold rather than at common temperature. Our ice chest (35 gp) can hold up to 12 midsize jars standing upright and 2 jars lying on their sides. We also supply ice year-round (1 gp per pound), shipped from Icewind Dale and stored in a cold shed. 43 Wizards' Laboratory 1 ice chest and 20 pounds of ice are needed for a complete laboratory; 20 pounds of ice will keep for 2 months JARS: Most wizards like to keep a vast cache of spell components and alchemical ingredients on hand. To do so they need an array of jars and corks. We offer jars of ceramic (made in Tilverton) and glass (made in Urmlaspyr), charging twice the listed cost for glass. All our jars— six ounce (8 cp), twelve ounce (1 sp), quart (2 sp), half-gallon (3 sp), gallon (5 sp), two gallon (1 gp), five gallon (2 gp), and ten gallon (3 gp)— come with cork stoppers that seal them tightly. 40 six-ounce, 40 12-ounce, 10 quart, 5 half-gallon, 15 gallon, 10 five-gallon, and 5 ten-gallon jars are needed for a complete laboratory MAGNETS: AS well as using them in certain spells, some wizards use an assortment of magnets to do everything from polarizing ionized liquids to holding their ink pens. 1\" x 1\": 5 sp; 2\" x 2\": 1 gp; 3\" x 3\": 3 gp. 3 of each size are requisite for a complete laboratory OPTIC AIDS: After years spent peering at minuscule scribbles in spell books, and watching the minute bubbling of liquids in flasks, even the most youthful mage may require visual assistance. We offer the common magnifying lens (2 gp), as well as a monocle (4 gp) to enhance the vision in one eye, and an odd set of lenses called spectacles (8 gp) that balance precariously upon the tip of one’s nose. 1 magnifying glass is required for a complete laboratory; DMs may require older mages to purchase the other two items OVENS AND KILNS: If heat is the common currency of alchemical research, ovens and kilns are the usurer’s office. Our ovens (60 gp) have a fire-hardened iron shell with a stoking chamber that contains adjustable air intakes and a metal vent that fits nicely through most windows. These ovens achieve heat levels that will melt lead. Our kilns (120 gp) are large, ceramic-work cylinders heated by a broad coal chamber. Instead of adjustable vents, our kiln coal chamber is fed by four attached bellows, set to pumping by the hot air vented through 44 Wizards' Laboratory the kiln’s back. With constant stoking, our kilns can reach heat levels that will fire bisque and melt low-grade steel. (Only anthracite coal should be used in our kilns.) 1 oven and 1 kiln are required for a complete laboratory PAPYRUS PADS: An experimenting mage may write more in an hour than the average man does in a lifetime. Our inexpensive papyrus pads (25 sheets for 15 gp) use quality cross-grain stock pressed in Mulhorand and sewn together along one edge by artisans in Chessenta and Unther. 4 pads are needed for a complete laboratory PESTLE AND MORTAR: Among the most ancient of alchemical instruments, the pestle and mortar are indispensable for crushing and powdering small quantities of solid materials. Both our 4 oz (3 gp) and 6 oz (6 gp) pestle and mortar sets are made of fine-quality black marble, highly polished on the sections you will handle and left raw on the grinding surfaces. (3 gp) 2 pestle and mortar sets are needed for a complete laboratory QUERN: Based upon the principle of the miller’s wheel, this self-powered grinding mechanism can powder most any solid, from wheat to lead. Operated by a crank and cam assembly atop the stone, our quern does the work of ten mortars and pestles. (20 gp) 1 is required for a complete laboratory RACKS AND STANDS: First among the unsung heroes of the laboratory are the various racks, stands, and holders that function as additional hands for the wizard. We offer wooden vial racks (1 gp) that can hold up to six vials, cushioned metal beaker stands (3 gp) that vary in height and include variously sized clamps and rings, and three-pronged heating stands (3 gp) that fit easily over a small brazier. All can support up to 15 lb of weight before failing. 10 of each type are needed for a complete laboratory 45 Wizards' Laboratory RETORT: An indispensable tool for distillation, the retort is a stock item for even the most basic laboratories. We offer retorts in 3 ounce (1 sp), 5 A complete laboratory requires 1 lap slate, 1 wall slate, and 2 chalk bundles ounce (5 sp), 12 ounce (1 gp), and quart (5 gp) sizes. Six 3 oz, six 5 oz, one 12 oz, and one quart size are needed for a complete laboratory RODS, GLASS: Though some mages still insist upon using wooden stirring rods (which sometimes flake into solutions and always absorb liquids they contact), glass stirring rods have become essential to accurate admixing. We offer small rods (3 sp) for stirring vial-sized mixtures, medium-length rods (4 sp) for stirring even large beakers, and large, thick rods (8 sp) for stirring containers up to cauldron-size. 6 small, 6 medium, and 2 large rods are needed for a complete laboratory SLATE AND CHALK: Though our papyrus is cheap by market value, it still may cost a mage dearly. To reserve papyrus for permanent laboratory needs a setrecords, a mage’s of slates and some chalk. We offer two sizes of slates—a 1-foot square lap slate (10 gp) and a 4-by-6 foot wall slate (30 gp), which can either be either mounted on a (sturdy) wall or set on one of our easels. Chalk comes at 1 cp per stick, or a bundle of 12 for 1 sp. We also offer chalk in red and yellow for 3 cp each (2 sp for 12). SPARKER: Flint and steel set upon a wire hinge, these convenient mechanisms provide a ready spark that can be easily introduced into a beaker of vapor. (5 sp) SPONGE: Where there are wizards and beakers, there will be spills. These sponges, harvested off Tharsult Isle in the Shining Sea, can absorb 100 times their weight of liquid. Shapes and colors vary. Small: 3 sp; Medium: 6 sp; Large: 1 gp. 5 of each size are required for a complete laboratory STRING: A skein of string can cover a multitude of sins. Useful not only as wicks and draw-strings to seal opened bags, string can also temporarily jury-rig most any laboratory setup. We offer a white, resilient and absorbent string (3 sp per 50 feet) that comes from a Maztican material crop, as well as the more familiar flaxen string (2 sp per 50 feet) from the Shining 46 Wizards' Laboratory Plains. For an added 3 cp per 50 feet, we offer black, red, and yellow string. All our string can hold up to 15 pounds before fraying. a skein of 1000 feet is required for a complete laboratory TONGS: Though gloves work fairly well for some tasks, white-hot objects, acid-filled containers, and flaming coals call for more distance from the subject. With our small tongs (1 gp), a mage can easily manipulate vials, beakers, and embers. With our large tongs (3 gp), a mage could well hammer out a shoe for his favorite horse, if he wished. 2 pairs of each size are required for a complete laboratory VENT: This handy device was invented by a gnomish craftsman of Waterdeep. The adjustable frame can be placed in a window, with the tip of the bellows pointing out. When a gaseous incident occurs in the laboratory, a nimble mage can pump the bellows to empty the room of the foul odor. The one-way valve in the bellows assures that the foul air goes out and does not return. (30 gp) 1 is required for a complete laboratory 47 WATER RESERVOIR: Clean hands make for sure results. Water reservoirs not only clean hands but can cool overheated equipment and wash away acids. The top keg of our water reservoir is tapped into a shallow trough, tilted toward an open bucket on the other side. To dispense fouled water, merely lift the bucket and fling the liquid into the street. This reservoir is handy enough that some mages I know have even used it to begin bathing regularly. Our standard reservoir holds 20 gallons (20 gp), though we also sell 25-gallon (27 gp) and 50-gallon (37 gp) types. 1 20-gallon water reservoir is required for a complete laboratory.

A town united against a menacing monster and armed with the simple (but deadly) tools of common laborers can cow even the most savage army of foes. And of course, on a daily basis these same peasant heroes turn their tools to the mundane but no-less necessary task of sowing and reaping, chiseling and joining—the constant and wearying work that makes our world. In tribute to such folk, I offer a complete line of tools and implements for the common laborer— all of which will serve well in times of peace, and many of which can become weapons of defense in times of war. Farmer DMs may allow PCs with the Agriculture proficiency access to (or ownership of) any or all of the following; such PCs may have weapon proficiency in items with weapon potential (DM’s option). BILLHOOK: If farmers have any true enemy, it is fire—which can steal not only one’s livelihood, but also one’s life. Though scythes can cut a firebreak to save a field, this billhook can remove thatch from a roof to save a home. A pole, once assembled, lets you raise this hook 15 feet to the crown of a roof to pull loose the thatch before the fire reaches it. The sharp and barbed tip makes this weapon also effective against vermin who make their homes in many thatched roofs. (5 gp) Billhook: Wt. 10 lb; S L; Typ P; Spd Fctr 9; Dmg 1d4/1d4; Hit Prob. -2; disassemble to carry HARNESS AND YOKE: Some sages say that our prosperous lands would not be so but for the simple harness and yoke. These simple implements place on the backs of beasts the burdens of men. We offer the carriage harnesses for one (2 gp), two (3 gp), and four (5 gp) horses. We also supply plow harnesses for one (5 gp) and two (7 gp) horses or oxen. Finally, our oxen yokes can pull a plow through the most stubborn ground—one ox (8 gp) and two oxen (11 gp). Those who have had trouble with oxen strangulation can try our newfangled yoke, which does not pull against the beast’s throat (15 gp and 20 gp). HOE: A simple tool with a thousand uses, the hoe ranks with the shovel in importance among the farmer’s tools. Our hoes feature 6’ long hardwood handles to minimize back pain and iron heads (3 gp). We also offer a heartier steel version (5 gp) that will handle even clay soil easily. Hoe: Wt. 5 lb; S L; Typ P; Spd Fctr 7; Dmg 1d3/1d2; natural roll of 1 breaks iron head 51 Laborers' List MALLET: Anyone who works on a farm knows that many problems can be dismissed by a large mallet swung liberally. Our mallets have oaken heads with flared striking surfaces reinforced with bands of steel. We offer a 20 pound mallet (5 gp) of solid oak, as well as a 30-pound mallet of oak core-filled with lead (9 gp). Mallet: Wt 20(30) lb; S L; Typ B; Spd Fctr 13; Dmg 2d6/2d6 (3d6/3d6); Hit Prob. -4; attack takes two rounds PICK: A good pick can rescue otherwise unplantable land by breaking up hard ground and splitting rocks too large to move. Our farmer’s pick has a head of pure steel to pierce the ground well, and a duskwood handle that allows much power for prying. (9 gp) Pick: Wt 15 lb; S M; Typ P; Spd Fctr 9; Dmg 1d6/1d6 PITCHFORK: Seafarers call it the “land trident,” and for good reason: 52 a pitchfork is as mighty in battle as in planting and tilling. We offer the traditional three-pronged maple pitchfork (2 gp) as well as an inventive variation from the lands of Thay that has a four-pronged head of steel (9 gp). (I suspect that this latter variety was never intended for farm use.) Pitchfork: Wt 4(8) lb; S L; Typ P; Spd Fctr 7; Dmg 1d4/1d4(1d4+1/1d4+1) PLOW: Sages say the plow is the unsung hero of our flourishing culture, letting the work of one farmer feed up to three families. We no longer offer iron plows because of repeated complaints of their tendency toward breakage. Our small plow (8 gp) can be pulled even by a mule or a very strong man, whereas our large plow (15 gp) requires a plow horse or an ox. Both work well with our harness or yoke, turning even stiff and clay-strewn fields. RAKE: Every autumn, rakes give farmers a giant’s hand for harvest. In the north, we are the only suppliers of Chultian bamboo rakes (3 gp), with long and curving fronds that can gather up to 5 pounds of hay in a swipe. We also offer the more common twig rakes (2 sp) used currently throughout the heartlands. Laborers' List REAVER: An old Vaasan saying states that “A reaver is a scythe gone mad.” Indeed, those who have seen reaving laborers in the field might think so, for the whirling flash and scissoring scrape of the blades fills the air. In fact, reavers are simple, dual-bladed devices hinged at the tip. When swung, the blades extend until they strike an obstacle, whereby they fold and scissor together. Some say reavers halve their harvest time. Our reavers come with a leather strap for binding the blades when not in use. (5 gp) Reaver: Wt 4 lb; S M; Typ S; Spd Fctr 7; Dmg 1d6/1d6; natural 20 does auto decapitation for man-sized foe; natural 1 does 1d6 to wielder SCYTHE: Among the most ancient, simple, and useful of farming devices, scythes allow harvesters to reap a 6-foot circle about themselves with one swipe. We offer scythes with a 3-foot steel blade and a 10-foot duskwood handle (8 gp) as well as selling the blades (5 gp) and the handle (4 gp) separately. Though scythes have received much bad gossip lately in regard to “grim reaper” legends, they still rank among the most useful and indispensable tools. Scythe: Wt 6 lb; S L; Typ S; Spd Fctr 10; Dmg 1d6/1d4+1; Hit Prob. -2 SEED-SOWERS: We offer two styles of hip-borne seeding containers—a leather seed pouch (2 gp), which can hold up to 100 pounds of seed, and a woven seed basket (5 gp) with the same capacity. The basket has a tray that can be jiggled while walking to disperse seeds evenly from the bottom. SHOVEL: A farmer’s main weapons in battling the land, shovels come in as many varieties as do swords. All our shovels have maplewood handles, solid steel spades, and smith-sharpened, fire-hardened tips. We offer a gardening shovel (3 gp), coal shovel (2 gp), postholer (4 gp), snowshovel (3 gp), and a hand spade (2 sp). Shovels make great mob weapons. Shovels: Wt 6 lb; S M; T B; Spd Fctr 7; Dmg 1d4+1/1d4; hand spades have negligible weapon potential 53 Laborers' List SICKLE: Grandchild of the scythe, sickles rate among the most common items for clearing brush or harvesting small plots of land. Our sickles are made of sturdy steel and have handles of oak. (6 sp) Sickle: Wt 3 lb; S S; Typ S; Spd Fctr 4; Dmg 1d4+1/1d4 SIEVE: Useful for all farmers from vintners to herdsmen, our sieve is among our most requested items. This 2-by-2 foot sieve rests on four spruce legs and can accommodate three screen types: pebble, grain, and sand. The sieve itself costs 5 gp, and each screen type costs 2 gp. W EEDING CLAW: This small metal claw should not be passed over as a useless item— in fact, I knew one farmer who claimed to have killed a shambling mound with one. (He always tended toward hyperbole.) Held in hand, this claw (7 sp) easily removes weeds, without filling one’s nails with dirt. The weeding claw can also fit on the end of our claw pole (6 sp) and be used as a rake. Weeding Claw: Wt 1 lb (4 lb on pole); S S(M); Typ P; Spd Fctr 3(7); Dmg 1d4-1/1d4-1(1d4/1d4) WHEELBARROW: One truism of farm life is that things are never where they need to be—especially heavy things. To assuage this perennial problem, we offer a sturdy wheelbarrow that can haul anything up to 400 lb—be it a load of grain, or one’s mate! The front wheel is made of sturdy iron by Berduskan wheelwrights, and the frame and rear wheel are made of solid duskwood. (15 gp) reduces base move by one quarter for each 100 lb to a minimum of 1 W INNOWING FLAIL: After taking such scrupulous care of their crops, young farmers are sometimes hesitant to flail them. Seasoned farmers are not. Our 4-foot maple flail is topped by four 1-foot steel rods that make quick work of knocking grain from chaff. With a grain sieve, this tool lets one person work like two. (6 gp) Winnowing flail: Wt 7 lb; S M; Typ B; Spd Fctr 6; Dmg 1d6/1d6 54 Laborers' List Joiners/Stonemasons DMs may allow PCs with the Carpentry and Stonemasonry proficiencies access to (or ownership of) any or all of the following; such PCs may have weapon proficiencies in items with weapon potential (DM’s option) AWL: For starting holes or scribing lines upon wood, a needle- tipped awl is the perfect choice. We offer a 3-inch awl (2 sp) for setting nails as well as a 6-inch auger (5 sp) for setting spikes. Awl: Wt 1 lb; S S; Typ P; Spd Fctr 1; Dmg 1d3/1d2 Auger: Wt 2 lb; S S; Typ P; Spd Fctr 3; Dmg 1d4/1d3 BOW DRILL: Constructed of a sturdy iron rod, our bow drill (3 gp) can accommodate all four sizes of drill bits: needle (1 sp), nail (7 cp), spike (3 sp), and peg (5 sp). We also offer these stone-piercing bits in mithral for ten times the list price. A bow drill with a set of 4 wood bits costs 4 gp and includes a pouch for the bits. needle or nail bits drill 2\" into wood and ½\" into stone per round; spike or peg take twice as long emergency.

CHISEL: Our chisel sets contain 12 chisels from ¼\" to 2\" in blade size. We use only the Calishite steel (purer than Heartland blends) or wood chisels (12 gp) and mithral from dwarven forges (120 gp) for stone chisels. CLAMP AND VICE: When a joiner or bricksman needs an additional set of hands, our clamps and vices can be 55 BRICKSMEN’S CATALOGUE: In addition to offering the crude tools of the trade, we provide numerous accoutrements to aid bricklayers in their other occupations. (Let those who understand be advised.) Our Bricksmen’s Catalogue may or may not be on hand at one of our stations, and is available to sharers of the trowel and mallet. (The brethren and sistern are known.) Requests to see the catalogue will only be honored in cases of extreme Laborers' List invaluable. We supply clamps that can hold up to 4\" (2 gp), 8\" (5 gp), and 16\" (10 gp), as well as a 10\" table- mounted vice (20 gp) for securing heavy materials. the vice weighs 30 lb and can secure up to 1000 lb FASTENERS: We provide fasteners of all sorts for joining wood, metal, and stone. We offer 1\" finishing nails this truth is self evident. Our wood glue 3 gp/lb) sets up in 1 hour and bonds any porous substance permanently to any other. Our mortar comes dry 5 cp/lb), also sets in 1 hour, and can be used with any stony material, or as an exterior coating to wood frames. Our pitch (1 sp/lb) is perfect for sealing leaky roofs or patching tiles in place. a wood glue bond holds up to 30 points of Str after dried (e.g., between a sleeping guard’s pants and his chair) (2 sp/lb) as well as 2\" and 3\" joiners’ nails (1 sp/lb). Our spikes come in 6\" (3 gp/dozen) and 1' (5 gp/dozen) sizes. We supply 8\" bolts that can be cut to size in coarse and fine thread size with the following diameters: ¼\", ½\", ¾\", 1\"—all at 3 gp/lb. The corresponding nuts to these bolts cost 2 gp/lb. We also provide cylindrical wooden peg stock in ½\", 1\", and 2\" sizes at 5 cp/foot, 1 sp/foot, 3 sp/foot, respectively. 12\" spikes act in all ways as a dagger in combat GLUE, MORTAR, PITCH: I find it ironic that even our most lofty edifices are held together by ground horse hooves, sandy lime, and foul-smelling tar. For joiners and masons, though, HAMMER: One cannot escape amazement when considering all the problems that can be righted by a whack from a good hammer. We stock nail hammers with special claws for nail removal (3 gp), spike hammers (5 gp), chisel hammers (4 gp), peg-setting mallets (8 gp), and tone-setting mallets (10 gp). Nail/spike/chisel hammers: Wt 4 lb; S S; Typ B; Spd Fctr 3; Dmg 1d4-1/1d4-1 Peg-/stone-setting mallets: Wt 15 lb; S M; Typ B; Spd Fctr 10; 1d6+1/1d6+1 HINGE: An old halfling saying states that “A cave with a hatch is only a cave; a cave with a hinged door is a home.” We stock iron hinges of all varieties: jewelry-box (5 cp), cabinet (7 cp), door (2 sp), barn (3 sp), 56 Laborers' List gate (4 sp), massive door (5 gp). These sizes are also available in steel for twice the price. Jewelry-box and cabinet hinges also come in silver (ten times price) and gold (100 times price). LADDER: Our ladders are made of sturdy duskwood and come in 2-foot (7 sp), 6-foot (3 gp), 10-foot (5 gp) and 20-foot (10 gp) sizes. For an extra gp, our 10- and 20-foot sizes can be fitted with hooks, allowing the ladders to be strung together and hung from a window or roof. can support 500 lb vertically and 400 lb laid out horizontally identification. Trowel: Wt 1 lb; S S; Typ S; Spd Fctr 2; Dmg 1d3/1d2 57 LATHE: A simple tool in practice, lathes create elegant staffs, columns, and spindles with ease and elegance. Our lathe (20 gp) can accommodate sections of wood or stone up to 2 feet long and 6 inches in diameter. We include bits for wood (5 gp) or stone (15 gp) at your request. SAWS: We supply wood and stone saws of every variety: common crosscut saw (3 gp), two-person ripsaw (7 gp), framed jigsaw (8 gp), two-person logging saw (15 gp), diamond-toothed stone hacksaw (15 gp), and diamond-toothed stone jigsaw (17). wood saws cut up to 2 square inches per round except logging saw at 10 square inches per round; stone saws cut ½ square inch per round TROWEL: Master masons can perform miracles with this simple tool, just as master painters do with a simple brush. We carry a 5” (2 gp), 7” (4 gp), and 10” (5 gp) trowel, each with a flat edge and a grooved edge. Requests for the stonemason sigil to be added require positive Laborers' List Smith DMs may allow PCs with the Armorer, Blacksmithing, and weaponsmithing proficiencies access to (or ownership of) any or all of the following; such PCs may have weapon proficiencies in items with weapon potential (DM’s option) required for all plate armor to prevent lost of 1 AC level per 6 months ANVIL: Not only smiths, but anyone who would forge his or her own armor or metal weaponry needs a solid anvil. We offer a solid steel 70 lb anvil (45 gp) suitable for smaller weapons and armor plates as well as a full sized 160 lb anvil (95 gp) for any smithing task. access to one such anvil is vital for the three proficiencies listed above ARMOR CARE KIT: For orcish warriors, battle-scarred armor symbolizes war prowess. Less barbaric warriors, though, realize the destructive effects of rust and wear on armor. For them, we provide an armor-polishing kit: a 9 oz jar of armor cleaner, a stiff cleaning brush, a 9 oz jar of armor polish, and a soft buffingof armor polish, and a soft buffing brush. The whole kit weighs only abrush. The whole kit weighs only a pound and a half and takes little roompound and a half and takes little room in a rucksack. (7 gp)in a rucksack. (7 gp) BELLOWS: Better bellows mean hotter fires; hotter fires mean purer metals; purer metals mean greater strength; stronger weapons or armor may save a warrior’s life. We offer a small (5 gp) and a large (10 gp) set of bellows. one of each is required to perform any of the three proficiencies listed above FORGE: The empowering tool for smiths of all kinds, the forge is the center of the smithy. All our forges run off of anthracite (1 gp/lb) or bituminous coal (1 gp/20 lb). We offer a small forge (50 gp) that weighs 40 lb and can grow hot enough to melt iron and steel. Our full forge (120 gp) weighs 120 lb and can achieve temperatures that will melt silver and even gold. 58 Laborers' List the small forge achieves 900 degrees C; large forge reaches 1100 degrees C; at least one small forge is needed to perform any of the three proficiencies listed FAT AND WAX: A smith’s work, strong though it may be in battle, wears quickly beneath the ravages of rust. By coating weapons in animal fat or (for highly valued items) wax, a smith can protect the steel products, leaving them shiny for sale. Both substances are durable and easily applied to hot metal. Fat: 5 cp/lb; Wax 5 sp/lb. GRINDSTONE: A giant with a butterknife can at times be less deadly than a halfling with a razor. All smiths know the importance of a good grindstone. Our grindstone (20 gp) rests upon a weighted wheel, spun by a foot-pedal assembly to assure even sharpening. For sharpening blades while on the road, we also offer a small, flat whetstone (2 cp) for sharpening long blades and a stiff leather strop (2 cp) for sharpening daggers and knives. one grindstone is required to use the named proficiencies; any PC with an edged weapon must have (and assumedly use) a whetstone or strop (as suits) or suffer -1 to dmg per 6 months for dullness HAMMER: No self-respecting smith would ever use the hammers of a joiner or stonemason. We supply smithy hammers with solid steel heads that weigh nearly four pounds, and duskwood handles to keep your hands cool. The nose of the hammer is broad and flat, and the tail slopes into a triangle to allow detail work.

Our bending pliers (2 gp) keep hands well away from the heat, and our small tooling pliers (4 gp) are round-edged to leave no marks. one of each type is needed for use of smithing proficiencies Husbandman BEEHIVE: How fitting that the sweetest of nectars comes from insects with the most savage sting. But only bears wage war on natural hives— intelligent races raise bees like they do cattle. We offer a beehive shaped like a large egg with nesting eggs within.

We offer tools to help speed the work, and minimize the pain for the animal. Our butchering tools include a 20 lb metal mallet (8 gp) for dispatching the beast with optimal speed. We also offer a set of 8 hooks (5 gp) for hanging the creature, and a foldable long-razor (7 gp) for draining blood. The other end of the long-razor contains a 6-inch foldable gut-hook that can cut through most any hide without knicking the viscera. Finally, we offer an 8-inch full-bellied skinning knife (5 gp) for the tough but delicate work of skinning a beast.

Truly the universal tool, knives are as simple and inexpensive as they are versatile. We offer a trail knife with a jag-toothed tip and a keen steel blade (1 gp) as well as an unique folding knife with two blades (4 gp).

Our shearing pack includes a soft leather thong to hold the lamb’s legs during the shearing and a gnomish contraption called a “biter.” Drawing the biter’s handles together causes the clamp to fasten down upon the wool and “bite” off a clump of it. The biter is shielded so it will not cut the sheep’s skin, and leaves enough wool to protect the hide beneath.

Here is where desperate folk on desperate quests cross paths and exchange at least glances, and more often gold and stories. Perhaps even more than (and my ecclesiastical friends must forgive me) temples, taverns and inns provide the gathering point for the folk of Toril, for to temples we come in unusual adoration or penitence, but in the tavern we come as ourselves. How many deals struck over a frothy tankard have spelled salvation (or doom) for our troubled land? How many great warriors (or warlords) learned their trade in barroom brawls? With roof and fire to turn the wintry blasts and ale and tales to warm the wintry heart, taverns and inns draw us all. So saying, I salute the proprietors of these salvific institutions, and offer them Faerun’s finest assortment of wares for their business.

Aurora’s Catalogue therefore hails the downtrodden and ill-used class of scribes, and provides them the equipment they need to set history to paper. We use only the finest quality paper from timber felled in the High Forest, and all of our books are bound in Waterdeep under the strict supervision of the Scriveners, Scribes, and Clerk’s Guild. Our products receive no greater recommendation than our yearly mass order from a representative of the Candlekeep sages. Scrivening Specialties BLANK BOOKS: We have a remarkable assortment of blank books for ledger-keeping, notetaking, or just diaries and journals. Our most common cover style is leather-covered suthwood, but we also offer suthwood uncovered, as well as cloth (5% off table below), felt (15% over table cost), and even some exotic skins and furs (check on what is available when ordering, minimum of 500 gp over cost, depending on size and page length). We offer regular books (9 inches by 12 inches), and also a special “tome” size, which is useful for displaying prominently to impress guests (15 inches by 20 inches). We provide a variety of page numbers in our books: 25, 50, 75, 100, 200, and 500. book size: number of pages: Reg. Tome 25 50 gp 75 gp 50 90 gp 135 gp 75 125 gp 180 gp 100 175 gp 250 gp 200 300 gp 450 gp 500 725 gp 1000 gp 67 The above table of costs applies to books with parchment pages. For books with paper, the cost must be doubled. Sorry, we do not offer bound books with papyrus pages. Example: a character wants to buy a book, made with paper, that is regular size and 200 pages. Furthermore, he wishes it bound in felt. Therefore, the base cost, 300 gp (from the table) is first multiplied by 1.15 (for felt), resulting in 345 gp, then doubled (for paper pages) for 690 gp. BLANK LOCKABLE BOOKS: Any of our books above may optionally be purchased with a steel-reinforced leather strap and lock. Lock Quality Price fair 65 gp good 100 gp excellent 200 gp Furthermore, you may choose a steel link strap for an additional 35 gp. A good lock gives a -5 % for a Pick Locks attempt; an excellent lock gives -15 %. Scribes' Desk BOOK SAFE: Our 500-page books of either size may be purchased as a book safe, with a hollow space where the pages are supposed to be, for one-fourth the cost of a normal book of the same size and type. As with our real books, these may be purchased with a lock at the above-mentioned additional costs. CASES FOR BOOKS: We now offer a fine portable book case for anyone of high stature or any mage with loads of spells. These trunks stand on end, are hinged vertically at the back, and fold open to reveal shelving on both sides. They have restraining straps across the front of each shelf, and are decorative enough to be left standing open to display all of your finest tomes. Skillfully crafted of cherrywood and brass, with an inner lining of quilted velvet, these cases are 275 gp each. Each case will hold 60 to 75 normal-sized books, or 40 to 50 tome-sized books. empty weight is 50 lb.; add book weight to figure encumbrance INKS: We offer a very large choice of ink colors for that special project, whether you’re working on a simple text, or a multi-volume, illustrated masterpiece. When ordering, check with us on our colors; we try to keep every known type in stock! Individual vials sell for 8 gp each, but if you order by the case (24 vials), we only charge 175 gp. MAP-MAKING KIT: Are you tired of losing adventuring companions to catastrophe because you can’t find your way back out of a dungeon quickly enough? Do you get tired of backtracking repeatedly through endless miles of wilderness terrain, searching for someplace you should have found already? Then this kit is for you. Within one small, oaken map tube, sealed against the elements, you will find: a starter set of 10 pages of mapping 68 Scribes' Desk parchment, with a grid line system already thoughtfully drawn in; a set of five colored charcoal markers; a pair of scales, for measuring distances; a quill pen with three nibs; a miniature bottle of ink; a thin steel rule, to help measure and draw straight lines, which also has some commonly used mapping stencils, such as the North arrow, stairs, and swinging doors; and finally, the Handbook of Mapping for Better Mapping Etiquette. This guide shows the fledgling mapmaker how to read and draw accurate, quality maps, using widely accepted symbols and terminology. It also provides sample maps of Waterdeep and the Sword Coast, for the beginning mapper to study and learn from. We offer this kit to you at the unbelievably low price of 35 gp. You may also order refills of gridded parchment (45 gp for 50 sheets), and charcoal (2 gp for five sticks of five colors each). It is left entirely up to the DM how he wishes to design the Handbook of Mapping, if at all, and details the provided maps might give. MAPCASE: This is an indispensable aid to the learned mapper, whose collection has grown unwieldy. Constructed of sturdy maple and trimmed in brass, this hinged case folds open to lay flat, providing two main compartments for flat and folded maps, as well as a series of tubes for those brittle, rolled-up maps that just have (32-nib kit, 14 different types), for 70 gp. If Non-weapon proficiencies are used, a forgery pen will give a + 2 bonus to an attempted “Forgery,” added to the character’s Dexterity score. wouldn’t survive otherwise. When the case is closed, there is a convenient handle for carrying, yet it’s small enough to go into a backpack. The case sells for 15 gp, or, for you money- conscious souls, an oak version sells for 4 gp. Both cases have been sealed against the elements. PENS: If you’ve got a heavy writing load, we’ve got the pens for you. Our quill pens are cut from the finest goose feathers, or, if you want the tools the serious professionals use, we also import metal nibs from Kara-Tur. We have several nib sizes and styles to choose from, for everything from basic writing to calligraphy, and even forgery pens. A case of 50 quill pens is 2 gp. In metal nibs, we have a set of five of any one size for 12 gp. Or, you may want our new deluxe package, which offers two or three of every size and style, depending on frequency of use, of every nib we 69 Scribes' Desk SCROLLCASE: Wizards and priests quickly tire of digging through a pile of crumpled scrolls at the bottom of a backpack, hurriedly trying to find the right scroll while the party’s getting eaten. To solve that problem, we have created a special scrollcase, made of fine-tooled leather, that organizes your scrolls with quick ease. The entire device is a long strip of leather, wide enough for most standard size scrolls, in which a series of pockets have been sewn, overlapping down the line. Any scroll can be slipped into one of the pockets, with only the top edge of the parchment page showing, revealing the title of that scroll. With a whole series of scrolls in place, your entire collection is easily indexed for quick perusal, yet quite safe in individual pockets. The whole case unrolls to about two feet, holding up to fifteen scrolls. When you’re ready to travel, the case rolls up into a nice, sturdy tube that clips shut, with a special pouch at the end that seals the whole up tight, protecting your precious scrolls against the elements. Our unique scrollcase sells for only 5 gp.

But no. We are the storers, the savers, the carriers, the keepers. We have different containers for eggs, wine, jewelry, water, pottery, clothes, dead bodies, babies— all of which you will find in the following list.

Ropes and chains are, as the old dwarf proverb states, the sinew of civilization. And where good ropes are worth their weight in gold, good locks are worth their weight in platinum: indeed, many such locks guard a thousand times their weight in gems and precious metals. I am pleased, therefore, to offer the finest assortment of ropes, chains, locks, and other supplies of general hardware needed by adventurers and pedestrians of all sorts. BLOCK AND TACKLE: With properly-strung block and tackle, one man can lift a giant from the ground. All of our block and tackle sets include a sturdy steel pulley and 100 ft of rope. We supply pulleys for capacities of 100-lb (3 gp), 200-lb (7 gp), 500-lb (15 gp), 1000-lb (25 gp), and even a two-pulley ton (35 gp) load capacity, with the appropriate rope. CHAIN: A fine chain of gold can win a lady’s hand as surely as a broad chain of iron will bind that of a hobgoblin. We offer chains in all sizes, from 1/8-inch wide ornamental chains to 4-inch wide anchor chains. The chain prices listed below are for iron chains. Steel costs twice as much and can bear twice the weight. Silver is 20 times the cost, and gold is 200 times more expensive (available only in 1/8 to 1/2 inch sizes).

Our good quality lock (100 gp) is fashioned of mithral, uses two uniquely forged keys, and can withstand even brutal prying. Our excellent lock (200 gp) has workings of adamantite, uses three keys, and contains noisemakers that prevent lockpickers from hearing the mechanism. All in all, these locks are worth 100 times their weight in gold, diamonds, rubies . . . Good lock provides -30 % to Open Locks roll; excellent lock provides -70 % PAINTBRUSHES: We offer brushes for every application: 4-inch wide brushes (4 gp) for painting clapboards, 1-inch and 1-inch wide brushes (5 gp each) for sign painting, and 3/4, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 and hairline brushes (3 gp) for portraitors and painters. All use camel hair from exotic Calimshan. General Hardware ROPE: We offer many varieties of rope, from narrow strings useful for ornamentation up to massive ropes used aboard ships. All of our ropes utilize the optimum weave, from a triple braid in our string stock to a dual pentad braid. The widths of hemp rope up to 1 inch are shaved for easier handling.

We offer head and hand stocks in single (6 gp) and double (10 gp) varieties, as well as ankle stocks in single (3 gp) and double (7 gp) types. When used in conjunction with our sharpened bench (8 gp), these stocks can truly bring rehabilitation. Our shackles come in sets that include a neck ring, two arm rings, two leg rings, and the wall mounts for each. (10 gp) We do not sell the so-called “maiden’s yoke,” which has spikes within the shackles. TALLY STICK: For a long while, the counting capacity of many folk was limited to the number of digits they possessed, but no longer. With this tally stick, bakers can assure full dozens, guards can keep track of numerous prisoners, warriors can remember how many arrows they have shot, priests can track on the holy treasury, wizards can calculate the shifts in volume of their concoctions—the list of uses is endless. Accurate to the hundreds place. (10 gp) If used as weapon, functions as per club with -1 to damage and hit prob. 74 Tailors' Corner The handiwork of the weaver, the seamstress, and the tailor appears on every body throughout Toril. If it is true as they say that “A ruff makes a nobleman and a slop makes a fool,” then we all owe our station, in part, to the cloth and clothes makers. To them I offer every item they need to ply their trade. All of the fabrics I offer come from the fine cities of Berdusk, Daerlun, Elturel, Nexal, Scornubel, Sutail, and Yhaunn, and the furs from trappers and rangers across the Heartlands and beyond.

I would include clothes also in that distinction. Though the rich can afford tailored attire, most peasants, merchants, and artisans could well use inexpensive, durable, and attractive clothing. All our clothing is created in Saerloon of solid Daerlunian wool and linen. Through special order (and extra payment) many designs are available in exotic cotton weaves from Maztica, silk from Shou Lung, velvet from Hillsfar, and even the leather of Elturel. All clothes are available in white, black, gray, beige, brown. Most can be dyed red, blue, yellow, or green for an added 2 sp. For added comfort, our shoes come in four different sizes: halfling, elven, human, and jumbo. (Of course, halfling-size shoes more often end up on the feet of human children than on the hairy feet of halflings). All our shoes and boots are crafted by members of the Cobbler’s Guild in Ordulin, and each carry the guild stamp. We even offer the famous Ordulinan orc-spiker boots at only one sp over the market-stall price. Underclothes BUSTLES: These unique items have become extremely fashionable among the ladies of the Sembian nobility. I stock bustles chiefly for the opera-going ladies of Sembia, but expect them to spread throughout Toril as more women wish to present a fuller figure to their admirers. Bustles attach around the waist and extend the curves of the hips in a complementary fashion beneath the dress. They enhance the allure of countless Sembian women, and can do the same for you! Our bustles are composed of the finest woven steel wire, conforming to feminine contours while not bending except under the most extraordinary stress. We add padding to each of our bustles to eliminate chafing. Small or large side bustle: 5 gp; small or large rear bustle: 9 gp. FULLCLOTH: For those who plan a visit to the Great Glacier and for those who simply must have the warmest clothing money can buy, we offer our fullcloth. Far larger than a mere loincloth, a fullcloth warms a person from shoulders to ankles. Sewn from two layers of thick-woven linen between which lies a layer of wool culled from Moonshae sheep, our durable body cloths let you survive the coldest blasts of air. Gnome: 1 gp; halfling: 3 gp; elf: 5 gp; human: 8 gp. Available only in gray or beige. HOSIERY: Never out of style. Whether adventuring in dank dungeons or attending a fine Waterdhavian affair, a good pair of hose is indispensable. Our comfortable collection ranges from durable wool and comfortable linen (for those who require sturdy leg-wear) to silk and velvet (at double 77 Clothes and Shoes the price). Gnome: 2 sp; halfling 4 sp; elf: 5 gp; human: 6 gp. HOSE SUPPORTERS: Does the slippage in your old pair of hose distress you? Your girth has shrunk, but your hose remain serviceable? We have just the thing for you! Our hose supporters will bolster the sagging spirits of your hosiery. Made of the finest Cormyrian horse leather, our hose supporters (2 gp) use buckles and straps that allow them to adjust to any size. The advantage of using a hose supporter rather than the typical, over-used belt is that none need see that one’s hose fit less than perfectly; hose supports can be worn beneath clothing. The leather can be dyed to specifications for only an additional 1 sp per order. LOINCLOTH: Our loincloth takes the standard undergarment to new levels! While the old loincloth was simply a strip of cloth designed to conceal, this new version upgirds as well. Whether you are an oiled-muscled, sword-swinging barbarian who wears nothing else, or a fine young nobleman who desires more comfort, our loincloths are perfect. We stock loincloths in wool, linen, and a weave of absorbent Maztican cotton, as well as silk, velvet, and leather (all for double the cost). Gnome: 3 sp; halfling: 4 sp; elf: 5 sp; human; 6 sp. Please designate ecto-, meso-, or endomorphic when ordering. LOUNGING ROBES: These warm robes are ideal for wearing after arriving home from a hard day at market. These comfortable house cloaks also provide an added layer of warmth when traveling. We offer only two sizes of this robe— demihuman and human—but offer many colors. Demihuman size costs 5 gp and human size costs 8 gp. NIGHTSHIRTS: Made from the finest flannel Toril has to offer, these long shirts ensure a night’s sleep. They tell all late visitors that you are unavailable for a long period of time. Favored by innkeeps the world over, they provide extra comfort on cold winter nights. Demihuman 4 gp; human: 6 gp. 78 Clothes and Shoes MONEY BELT: Everyone wandering the streets of Faerun’s major cities has a good money belt—or little money. The closeable compartments in our money belt are large enough to carry up to 40 of your favorite coins, whether Cormyrean golden lions or Shou Lung copper. Easily concealable beneath shirt or pants, this accessory is a must for all city dwellers. (4 gp) STOCKINGS: To ensure clean feet and pleasant- smelling footwear, we offer cotton, woolen, or flannel stockings. They come short or long, as the buyer desires. Our stockings have warmed the toes of elf and dwarf alike. In fact, one loyal customer once reported finding a slain pack of orcs— all of which were wearing Aurora- ordered stockings. (They weren’t wearing any after he left.) Demihuman: 1 gp/pair; human: 2 gp/pair. Overclothes BREECHES: The unsung hero of overclothes, breeches daily upgird our civilization, raising us above the level of orcs and trolls. All of our breeches are double stitched for added strength in the seams and made of durable material. In any size, our breeches feature a draw-string waist for complete 79 adjustability and a buttoned ventral gap for the men. Our elf-size breeches run as follows: sack cloth (5 sp), linen (1 gp), woolen (2 gp), velvet (4 gp), silk (8 gp). Cost for halfling and gnome sizes is halved, cost for human sizes is half again more the listed price. Larger sizes available by special order. Please request color when ordering: white, brown, beige, gray, or black. (Dyeing is available.) belt to hold up the waistband. They come only in velvet or silk, the latter doubling the cost. For velvet cannons, the prices run as follows: gnome (5 gp), halfling (6 gp), elf (8 gp), human (10 gp). Please specify ecto-, meso-, or endomorphic and color when ordering: white, brown, beige, gray, or black (dyeing is available). CANNONS: Among the most fashionable types of modern breeches, our cannons fit tightly to legs from the waist to the ankles, providing full flexibility, warmth, and comfort. Our cannons are laced together in front and contain a slim Clothes and Shoes CHEMISE: “Beneath robes of kings and yokes of slaves there lies a chemise.” Standard apparel from the rich down to the poor, the chemise holds universal sway throughout the Heartlands. All our chemises are attractive and durable enough to be worn as an overgarment, as the peasantry prefers, and comfortable enough to serve as a nobleman’s undergarment. Prices for an elf-size chemise vary according to material: sackcloth (8 sp); linen (2 gp); Maztican cotton (3 gp); silk (6 gp). Comes only in white, beige, or gray. CODPIECE: Essential for all well-dressed men, our codpieces attach easily to all breeches, whether buttoned or laced in front. We offer both flat (1 sp) and bag (1 gp) types in linen, with gold embroidered ornamentation optional (add 1 gp). Velvet or silk codpieces cost double. Gem encrustation on special order only. Available in blue, red, black, white, and brown. COTE: Mate of the common chemise, the cote raises one’s apparel from the level of necessity to that of style. We offer linen sleeved and sleeveless cotes in white, tan, brown, and black (gnome: 3 gp; halfling: 4 sp; elf: 6 gp; human: 7 gp). Dyeing is available, but at double the price. Decorative gold embroidery can be added for 4 sp more. 80 DOUBLET: Along the northern shores of the Sea of Fallen Stars, doublets have grown to tremendous popularity. All our doublets are fronted by a row of buttons and contain comfortable joints for shoulders and elbows. The stock material for our doublets is linen, and is available in gnome (3 sp), halfling (4 sp), elf (6 sp), and human (1 gp) sizes. For velvet or silk, the cost is doubled, and for brocade it is tripled. We offer doublets in the common colors—white, beige, gray, brown, and black—for no Clothes and Shoes additional cost and in red, blue, or green for the dyeing charge (2 sp). DRESS: Dresses and gowns are almost universally praised by admiring men for “complementing the fairer figures” and providing women “a healthy circulation of air.” In turn, they are almost universally cursed by women for “making us immobile” and “letting our knees freeze off.” Though most adventuring women have donned garb suitable for such actions, dresses and gowns still remain popular among homebound folk. We offer a common laborwoman’s dress made of durable and comfortable linen and available in gnome (7 cp), halfling (8 cp), elf (1 sp), and human (2 sp) sizes. The central drawstring makes the dress fit all girths. White, beige, gray, brown, and black cost nothing extra, and any dyeing costs 2 sp. Our gown is a simple dress of silk that can be later adorned by lace and ruffles. The dress comes in gnome (5 gp), halfling (7 gp), elf (10 gp), and human (15 gp) sizes in red, blue, green, black, brown, and white. Please specify ecto-, meso-, or endomorphic. GIRDLE: Girdles are not only a perfect ornament for the hips but also a useful article of clothing. All our girdles are 2 inches wide, made of finest silk, and embroidered with curvilinear patterns by Calishite craftsmen. The girdles themselves come in blue, green, red, and yellow, each with gold thread embroidery upon them. The pattern can be geometric, floral, or curvilinear. All girdles are 6 gp. Outerclothes BELTS: We offer a magnificent variety of belts, from the hefty leather weapon belts (with an optional baldric, for those quivers and short swords that we all prefer to keep handy, 7 sp), down to finely crafted gold-braid waist belts for those of elegant dress (25 gp). Our most common style of belt is either the canvas belt (2 sp), or leather (3 sp). In either of these styles we offer a special option; secret pouches between layers, where special documents or high end coinage can be safely and secretly stored. Access is from the inside surface of the belt, 2 sp above base cost. Widen your leather belt, and you now have enough room in your secret pouch for a 81 Clothes and Shoes very thin blade. Aurora’s also offers money belts, for merchants who dislike walking about with large sums of cash visible. We provide special sound-dampening fabric as an inner lining on these to dampen the jingle of your coin from being discerned by prying ears. We also offer some other unusual belts, such as the tool belt, with many built-in pouches and tool loops for the handyman (5 gp), and harvesting belts (3 sp), with hooks for attaching vegetable sacks. Please specify waist size when ordering; anything in silk is triple normal cost. CAPES: No outfit is complete without a stylish cape. We sell capes of several different materials, including wool, fur (some exotic animal furs can be acquired through special order) and even a very handsome black silk cape, lined with red velvet. Half-capes, 4 sp, Full-, 7 sp. Capes available in white, brown, black, and gray for wool, and above plus red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet for silk. For all sizes, fur is double and silk triple normal cost. CAPS AND HATS: There are probably as many different styles of caps and hats as there are people in Toril. We always keep a choice supply on hand. We have berets, stocking caps, skull caps, fur-lined hunting hats (with ear flaps, if desired), turbans, hoods, and coifs. A variety of materials are used for our hats and caps, including linen, wool, leather, and fur (doubles cost). Silk and felt may be specified in special order, and at triple cost. Most hats and caps: 1 sp; turbans and berets: 3 sp; fur lining adds 1 silver piece. Colors are available as per capes. CLOAKS: We strive to keep a superior assortment of cloaks on hand for the most demanding customer. We stock cloaks made of most common materials, as well as imported fabrics. Our stylish dress cloaks are very well made, with a variety of elegant clasps and brooches, and are suitable for most formal occasions (8-15 sp). We also have some cold weather full cloaks (2 gp), which are made of several layers of wool for added insulation, and which serve well as a blanket, too. Fur cloaks made of bear, wolf, raccoon, and other common animals are usually available (50 gp), and other types can often be acquired through special order (costs 82 vary, starting at 150 gp). We offer several styles, with or without hoods, and even some specially designed cloaks with inner pouches and pockets to keep valuables inconspicuous. Anything custom designed like this doubles the cost. The colors available for cloaks are white, brown, black, grey, and forest green for all fabrics but silk, which comes in red, orange, yellow, blue, and violet for silk. GLOVES AND MITTENS: Everyone hates to have cold hands, and with that in mind, we offer a fabulous selection of gloves and mittens. For the purchaser of distinction, we offer fine linen gloves (5 gp), or even silk (15 gp) for special occasions. We also have working gloves, made of canvas or leather and suitable for tasks from gardening to smithing (1 gp), and gauntlets (2 gp) for weapon masters.

They have a steel- reinforced toe and heel, as well as steel plating in the shin guard. They go to mid-shin. You can purchase these in human and dwarven sizes. At only 45 gp a pair, these boots are a “steel!” using these boots in unarmed combat, a kick will do 1d2 damage. However, the greater weight of these force a character to subtract 2 from any movement speed greater than walking (i.e., base move is 12, jog is 22, not 24). ELF SHOES: The world is filled with elven adventurers writing home for a new pair of boots each season. Write no longer. Aurora’s now stocks your favorite footwear. These go for 45 gp a pair, and are certain to make you quiet. Unfortunately, elves are the only ones who can get their slender feet into these. I’ve spoken to the craftsmen about “other” sizes, but they claim that half of the benefit of the shoe comes from the elf foot inside them. Sorry, folks, but at least the orcs won’t be wearing them either. when an elf wears these shoes, he/she gains a +1 bonus on surprise rolls, and a +10% on move silently; no other creatures can gain these bonuses though, regardless of the method used to alter them to fit HIGH BOOTS: One of our standard, top-of-the-line boot types, these high boots come in two main styles: hard and soft. Either style comes to just above the knee, with a fold-down flaring cuff. The hard boots are constructed of toughened boiled leather, and sell for 3 gp, while the soft ones are made of leather-reinforced kid, and go for 1 gp. You can also purchase high boots made of sheepskin or other animal pelt, such as the barbarians usually wear, for 4 gp. Any one of these boot types can have a dagger sheath sewn into them for 1 gp each. HIP BOOTS: Originally designed and worn by fishermen in the shallow reaches of the Moonsea, these “pants” are constructed of leather and sealed in pitch to make them watertight. Also known as waders, they are quite useful in shallow-water activities for folk who prefer not to get wet. We sell them for 15 gp, and they come in brown or black. Retarring of old waders costs a mere 3 sp and requires two days for service. 87 Clothes and Shoes LOW BOOTS: Similar in style and construction to the high boots, these come up only to mid-shin, so there’s not quite as much weight to lug around. Hard low boots sell for 2 gp, while soft ones are 15 sp a pair. Again, animal skin low boots are available at 3 gp/pair, and also the same option of dagger sheaths at 1 gp each. MOCCASINS: These shoes have recently been imported from Maztica. They are similar in style to the low, soft boot, but they have soft soles, and are laced for added fit. No weapon sheaths can be sewn into these, as the fit is too snug, but they are very quiet. We sell them for 2 gp a pair. a character wearing moccasins gains +5 % to move silently, but these cannot be worn by non-Maztican natives for more than one day, due to lack of arch support. For each day of use, a character must go 1 day with regular shoes, to rest his feet. ORC-SPIKER BOOTS: These interesting boots have been asked for lately, and now, here they are. You get your basic high or low hard boot, but with a socket at the toe, for attachments.

Think of them as fine, soft, cozy “mittens for feet.” Worn by eastern assassins, these shoes are quiet. We sell them only in black, but you may get wool (45 gp) or silk (100 gp). These are limited in supply, so order early. These shoes improve silence (+10%) to all Rogue characters who wear them, but are readily noticeable as the shoe of sneaky people, who often distrust the wearer 89 Boom's Garden In all my travels I have seen many miraculous things: penitent dragons, lusty paladins, a pair of dwarf and elf drinking buddies—even the world-shattering war of the Avatars. None of it, however, has amazed and stupefied me as much as the appearance of armored undergarments: scale-mail loincloths, chain-mail brassieres, plate-mail bustiers—I once even saw a berserker rush into battle wearing nothing more than a narrow strip of gold about his waist. (He was dispatched by the first blow.) The advent and popularity of these flashy pieces of (non)armor have set my mind to wonder: why do people wear such armor? what sort of protection does it afford? do the protected members contain regenerative qualities that will aid the rest of the body after it has been hacked to bits? what odd sports do these folk engage in that armored undergarments would aid them? Plagued for months by such questions, I at last found the answer to my question, as well as finding the maker and seller of such finery—Boom’s Garden of Waterdeep. This unique shop is set up in the smoke-blackened brick warehouse of a failed gnome inventor, and I daresay the shop packs more explosive power now than ever. The proprietor is a woman who goes by the name Kar and can wield smithing tools better than any five men put together. In the scant 15 minutes I spent wandering about the shop, I discovered items that still amaze me. Many of them I cannot offer in this catalogue of mine, but you will find a few of the choice (and tame) selections in the following pages. All must be special ordered with complete measurements to insure a perfect fit. Small and medium sizes cost the prices shown; large and extra large are half again more. BROADBELT: These metal-studded leather belts are the geographic and stylistic center of fashion armor: Broadbelts can support a bustier, carry weaponry, suspend a loin guard, and impress the enemy all at once. Our steel-spiked broadbelt is replete with small holes for mounting the aforementioned articles of armor or weaponry. The massive buckle can be tightened to compress one’s viscera when lifting heavy objects. Available in black or brown. For both male and female.

Our black leather collar contains eight spikes and an adjustable buckle to fit any neck. 91 provides no AC adjustment CORSET: Though I cannot imagine doing battle in this constrictive and torturous device, many female warriors swear that the attractiveness produced by an armored corset often lets them avert combat altogether. Available in leather for 5 gp (6 lb), chain mail for 25 gp (14 lb), and scale mail 45 gp (14 lb), all of the armored corsets we carry include steel stays for the perfect waistline. One size fits all.

As well as offering the full leggings of chain mail for 35 gp (20 lb), we offer partial leggings that clutch the thigh and calf in alluring curvilinear patterns for 33 gp (12 lb). These plate mail leggings must be fitted exactly, so make certain your measurements are accurate. full chain mail leggings provide -2 to AC; half leggings provide no AC adjustment LOIN CLOTH: Once only a utilitarian item of clothing, loin cloths have become of late statements of a warrior’s style. We offer loincloths in many varieties of material and accompaniments: stiff leather (2 gp), supple leather (5 gp), wolf fur (9 gp), bear fur (12 gp), chain mail (20 gp), scale mail (23 gp), and plate mail (35 gp).

Gem setting loin guards can hold up to 100 gems (laid by a jeweler after purchase). All types cost the same amount in bronze (5 gp), iron (3 gp), steel (6 gp), silver (30 gp) and gold (60 gp).

Constructed of overlaid semicircles of bronze (3 gp/pr), steel (5 gp/pr), silver (20 gp, pr), or gold (40 gp/pr), these shoulder plates will turn fierce blows without hiding the alluring lines of shoulder and collar bones. Some orcs have seen these and turned to run.

Our skirts wrap well around the vulnerable tendons and muscles of the rear leg while open for bare legs or stylish leggings.

We offer shoes in red, brown, or black, with steel or bone blades. (10 gp) SWIMWEAR, DROW: Through dark connections Boom’s Garden has acquired the much-talked-about drow spiderweb swimwear.

With a tailer secured to one’s broadbelt, an adventurer needn’t fear attacks from behind—at least from halflings and kobolds.

Please specify the following when ordering: gender of the wearer, costume or formal, powdered or non-powdered, color, the country and city in which the wig will be worn, and the event at which it will be worn. The best crafters of Tethyr will create a wig suitable for your needs. (1 gp) 101 Illuminations Many epigrams speak to the importance of light. The elves commonly say, “One who lights a candle awakens a small sun.” An old dwarf expression runs, “With a shovel I can dig a grave; give me a lantern too, and I’ll dig a home.” The ancient human proverb, “Seeing is believing,” can be matched in pragmatic wisdom only by the orcish saying, “Kill anything you see.” Clearly, even many of the foulest races seek some illumination. We offer not only the common lamps, lanterns, and other light sources, but also implements that can aid those with infra-vision, or extend sight into a deep fog. All of our devices of illumination come from the work-tables of the finest artisans, who use only the most pure, elegant, and durable materials. As well as lighting a home or providing aid to scriveners, our lighting accoutrements may prove as valuable as a broad-sword in the depths of a dungeon. Lamps CALISHITE: Featured in many children’s tales about genies, this imported lamp of finely worked and engraved metal features a classic design with a pointed wick holder. Available in brass (1 gp), copper (5 gp), silver (15 gp) and gold (50 gp and up— special order only). Comes with a two-pint flask of exotic lamp oil. Patchouli, sandalwood or cinnamon scents. Exotic scented lamp oil refills are available. Lights a 360-degree area out to 15 feet. Burns 12 hours per pint of oil. Holds one pint. CHIME LAMP: The chime lamps of Evermeet have delighted many a person with their pleasant tinkling and rosy glow. Constructed of brass with brass or crystal chimes, the heated air created by this lamp turns a delicate vented wheel, the blades of which strike 102 tiny chimes arrayed around the lamp (20 gp). Lights a 360-degree area out to 15 feet. Burns 6 hours per half-pint of oil. Holds a half pint. GNOMISH FIREFLY LAMP: Gnomish lamps have recently become popular at parties held by the nobility in Waterdeep, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, Suzail, and Arabel. This odd, basket-like device of wire mesh, when whirled on its chain in the woods, catches fireflies. The captured fireflies provide an eye-catching but feeble glow, and are prevented from escaping when the lid is lowered. The lamps are often hung about a room or from poles or trees in a garden to provide atmosphere. If the fireflies are not released at the end of an evening, they die. Those with a tender heart should Illuminations remember to complete this task before going to bed after a jolly night of carousing. (9 sp) Provides no real useful illumination, but does not generate heat that would cause problems with infravision either. HURRICANE: This oil lamp is most notable for its reputation for not blowing out once lit. The glass cylinder which protects the open flame, quaintly referred to as a chimney, is what prevents the errant breeze or any quick motion of the person bearing the lamp from extinguishing it. My hurricane lamps are quite beautiful, as each features a matching design etched into both its metal base and its elegant blown glass chimney. A delicate cog arrangement of dwarven manufacture raises and lowers the braided wick. Brass, 1 gp; copper, 4 gp; or silver 12 gp. Available with floral or geometric pattern. Lights an area 20 feet in diameter, with a 5-foot area of semidarkness. Burns for eight hours on one pint of oil, and holds one pint. Light cannot be extinguished accidentally without removing the glass chimney first. At the DM’s discretion, the lamp can receive a saving throw as a third level fighter versus spells that might extinguish its flame—for instance, gust of wind. OIL: Oil lamps are a staple form of illumination, but are more suited to indoor use as they are difficult to carry and prone to go out in breezes. Oil lamps can be formed of many materials, and I offer exquisite versions in several mediums (all hold one pint of oil and a wick in their bowls): Carved onyx (other semiprecious stones available by special order), 9 sp; worked brass, 5 sp; and kiln-glazed pottery, 1 sp. Lights a 360-degree area out to 15 feet. Burns 12 hours per pint of oil. Holds a pint. WARMING: Many a chilly bed or pair of frost-nipped hands has been rendered toasty by a warming lamp. This fist-sized iron sphere has tiny vents to allow air to reach the coals which provide its heat. Coals are inserted into the lamp through a small trapdoor held closed with a tiny pin or hook. Elves, gnomes, and other beings with infravision often make use of warming lamps as small beacons. (8 sp) Lanterns BULLSEYE: The easily portable bullseye lantern is the friend of many an adventuring band. My fine bullseye lanterns have metal housings with panels of glass to keep wind away from the flame. The metal is polished on the inside to reflect light outward in a funneled path. A shutter (included) can be set in place over the glass to block out the light. This bullseye is equipped with adjustable vents to regulate airflow, and thus the brightness and longevity of the flame and heat of the lantern (12 gp). 103 Illuminations Even when the shutter is closed, some light still escapes from the lantern. Closing off every crack in the lantern’s assembly would quickly extinguish the flame. Adventurers must remember that even if the shutter is closed, the lantern will shed enough light to give away their position in a dark dungeon. A bullseye lantern’s light reaches 60 feet, with an additional 20 feet of semidarkness. A bullseye lantern burns six hours per pint flask of oil, and holds one pint. FOG-CUTTER: After a friend of mine spent some time on the coast at a lighthouse, he brought back with him a lantern which he found useful in cutting through the frequent sea fogs. The fog-cutter is an adaptation of the design of that lantern, and is a variant on the bullseye lantern. It features a glass focussing lens of an amber color which illuminates an area better in foggy conditions than a standard bullseye or hooded lantern (15 gp). A fog-cutter’s light reaches 60 feet, with an addition 20 feet of semidarkness. In the fog, its light reaches 30 feet, with an addition 10 feet of semidarkness (as opposed to a normal light source which is cut by two-thirds in fog). A fog-cutter burns six hours per pint flask of oil, and holds one pint. If a referee is using the optional degrees of darkness found on page 119 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide, within the illumination path of the fog-cutter, moderately foggy conditions are treated as clear, and densely foggy conditions are treated as moderately foggy. HOODED: The hooded lantern is the basic lantern which all other lanterns are variations on. A sturdy classic design, the lanterns I stock feature a rust-resistant metal reservoir for the oil and a metal cap. Between the two is a metal assembly with disks of thick glass inset in it that allows light to escape. The metal cap limits heat radiated to the top of the lantern, allowing it to be carried by a handle which curves over its top. (7 gp) This lantern projects light 30 feet in all directions (360 degrees) and burns six hours per pint flask of oil supplied. Holds one pint of oil. INFRA- LANTERN: This strange device appears to be a normal hooded lantern, but in place of a wick, dancing with a flame, it holds a faceted gem. These gems are pieces of the dweomercraft of the dark elves, and as such will lose their power if they ever are touched by the rays of the sun. A creature or person who sees by way of infravision finds this lantern to be a great boon underground and at night, for it allows him to see with greater clarity by infravision. These infra-lanterns are fashioned only from extremely rare imported and magical gems, and so I am sorry if your request finds me temporarily out of stock (1700 gp). Infra-lanterns are nigh useless to beings with normal sight alone, as the vibrations the lanterns emit cannot be seen at all by them. 104 Illuminations DMs should allow the purchase of infra-lanterns only if they feel that their campaigns would not be unduly unbalanced by them. An infra-lantern does one of two things, depending on how infravision is handled in a game. If the DM is using standard infravision, then an infra-lantern allows infravision (seeing in the dark) out to 90 feet. If the DM is using optional infravision, where creatures with infravision see heat, then an infra-lantern sharpens the infra-vision and allows greater details to be made out: an orc can be identified as an orc, not a man-sized humanoid, for instance, and objects usually of such a small difference in temperature as to be indistinguishable, like the walls, the floor and a door, can all easily be told apart. It also increases the range of infravision to 70 feet. SPELUNKER’S: This lantern is gyroscope or other affixed to a heavy leather headband which is adjustable. It somewhat resembles a gnomish or dwarven artifact in that it consists of a series of half circles of formed wood which pivot within each other to allow the weighted bowl of the lantern to remain ever upright, no matter what position the wearer is in. The lantern is constructed so as to make SELF- DOUSING: Self-dousing lanterns are particularly popular with innkeepers. The metal pincers hold a candle over a water reservoir, and as the candle burns down, drips are prevented from marring the inn’s furniture. But most importantly, if a tipsy patron falls asleep without extinguishing the candle, the water will put out the flame when the candle gets low. I recommend this lantern also to sages, learned nobles, priests, and wizards who are prone to stay up late reading and might doze off over their studies. I have heard of more than one clumsy innkeeper whose life was saved when they tripped and the self-douser extinguished. (6 sp) Lights a 360-degree area out to 15 feet. Typical candles burn from 2-3 hours, although self-dousing lanterns can be constructed to accommodate larger candles. it virtually impossible to involuntarily douse the lantern's flame or to catch the wearer or his clothing or supplies alight (20 gp). Illuminates a funnelled area 30 feet long, with an addition 5 feet of semidarkness. A spelunker’s lantern burns three hours per half-pint oil, and holds one half-pint. Other Supplies BEESWAX: Suitable for use in candles or as sealing wax (1 gp per pound; colors other than natural, 11 sp per pound). Available in any color. If I don’t stock the color you want, supply me with a sample of the color, and I’ll match it. 105 Illuminations CANDLE- STICKS: While candles are a trusted source of illumination, they require holders. I carry candlesticks by the pair ranging from the fanciful to the sturdily utilitarian: carved wood, 4 sp; lathe-turned brass, 6 sp; lathe-turned copper, 8 sp; carved onyx, carnelian, or soapstone, 1 gp; kiln-glazed pottery, 3 sp; large wrought iron, 3 gp. LAMP OIL: This long-burning whale oil is pure and has none of the lingering, rancid scent found in lesser products of the type (6 cp per one-pint flask). LAMP OIL, EXOTIC SCENTED: The purest of imported oils from Calimshan, these can be used in the Calishite lamp or any other oil-burning lamp (4 sp per two-pint flask). Available in cinnamon, patchouli, frankincense, sandalwood, myrrh, rose, lily of the valley, violet, and pine scents. TINDERBOX, FLINT AND STEEL: All of my tinderboxes are constructed of sturdy heart of oak for durability, and resistance to warping, dings, and scratches. They include a number of items: the waterproofed, small oak box, a large piece of flint, several coarse steel bars, tinder, and scraps of charred cloth (15 sp, 5 sp for just the flint and steel). A character can start a small smoldering flame in 1d6 rounds (longer in windy conditions or if the kindling is wet). TORCHES: A sturdy torch often provides light in dungeons and caves, and my torches are prepared and treated to reduce the excessive smoke that many improvised torches produce (1 cp ea). WICKS: These fine, braided linen wicks come in two sizes, thin, for candles, and thick, for oil lanterns (1 cp per yard for thin, and 1 cp per 2 feet for thick). At least four feet of the thin wicking is required for the candle mold. 107 Diversions Occasionally stout-hearted adventurers need to unwind and enjoy themselves in amusements and diversions which do not risk life and limb. So too the children of older adventurers need their own entertainment when mother and father are out smiting evil. For this reason we’ve included a section of toys for the younger set and games for Aurora’s more mature customers who remain young at heart. Drawing from the rich cultural traditions of the Heartlands and the wonders beyond, I have assembled a selection of toys for the children and games for the adults. All amusements are durable and elegant in their design, crafted by the finest artisans in the country of the toy or game’s origin. Most can be packed away in a rucksack and brought out for fireside amusement while on adventure or during that long winter’s respite from the adventuring life. While I have separated these diversions into two separate categories, there is no rule to say that a child would not find wonderful entertainment in the games section, or that an adult would not be delighted by a selection from the toy department. Enjoy! Toys ANIMAL MODELS: Carved of rich woods from Sembia and Cormyr, these twelve-inch long toys are fitted with wheels so a child can pull them along. Expertly crafted with internal hinges that allow the mouth to open and close and the tail to wag as it moves, each is a delight for the younger ones. Recommended ages 2-5. Specify animal when ordering. All styles available for 1 gp each. Each model weighs around 5 lbs. Rolling Horse Rolling Dragon Rolling Pegasus Rolling Unicorn Rolling Cow Rolling Elephant Rolling Pack Mule Rolling Beholder (DISCONTINUED) 108 BALLS, LEATHER: These strong, sturdy cowhide balls are available in 2\" juggling sizes, 4\" handball sizes, and cloth-wrapped 12\" sizes for small children. The most durable of these balls comes from Ordulin, and Aurora’s has an exclusive license with Anaster’s Leatherworks to distribute balls made from their soft, supple leathers beyond the Sembian borders. 2\" ball—1 sp 4\" ball—2 sp 12\" ball—2 gp Bow AND ARROW SET, PLAY: Your child can emulate his or her favorite ranger with this safe play set. The arrow tips are bean-bags affixed securely to the shafts, and the bow is a marvelously resilient willow stem with a Diversions 5-lb pull. In addition to letting the child act like the grown-ups, the set teaches good missile weapon etiquette and care. Always supervise your child when playing with our weapons, especially since they ARE harmless. Made in the Dalelands. Play set costs 2 gp and contains bow, three bowstrings, and 5 safety arrows. ROF 1, Range 1/2/3, Weight 2, Size S, Type B, Speed Factor 8, Damage 0/0 CLOCKWORKS: Made in the fabled island nation of Lantan by the craftworking Gondsmen, these small (2\"-long) toys look like birds, animals, and fish. Their delicate metal shells are crammed with springs and wires, so that the birds fly, the animals scurry along the ground, and the fish can swim, all for short distances. The metal is painted and draped with streamers. These are beautiful and fragile toys, so order more than one. All clockworks are tested by our salespeople before delivery to ensure that they work correctly (and because THEY enjoy playing with the toys as well). Clockworks cost 2 gp each, or get a selection of 10 for 15 gp! 109 DOLLS, FABRIC: A staple for both boys and girls throughout Faerun, these dolls come from a variety of sources, from Waterdeep to the small cities of the Dragon Sea. All are of the highest-quality cloth (for porcelain dolls see the next entry) and stuffed with down and felt for softness. Check out our variety for that perfect companion, at 3 sp each. Townswoman Townsman Princess Prince Warrioress Warrior Sorceress Sorcerer Priestess Priest Rogue (female) Rogue (male) * Note: All adventurer dolls are provided with soft stuffed weapons. When ordering priest and priestess dolls, if a particular alignment or faith is desired, please note in the order, otherwise a nondenominational doll will be provided. Special orders available for halflings, dwarves, elves, and gnomes. Diversions DOLLS, PORCELAIN: Made in Tilverton and Urmlaspyr, these baby dolls are made of fine china and decked out in rich swaddling clothes. While not suitable for life on the trail, they are perfect for the children of retired adventurers who have a long winter’s rest ahead of them. Due to complaints on quality, Aurora’s no longer carries Westgate porcelain or dolls. Only human dolls available, at 2 gp each. KALEIDOSCOPE: Imported from Calimshan, these brass tubes look like a spyglass, but they allow sight into a totally new world—colored bits of glass and gems spin and are mirrored in the tube, so that the viewer sees rainbow snowflakes through the tube. Exciting, and non-magically safe, it a wonderful toy for children of all ages! A special value at 50 gp! NESTING DOLLS: Always a favorite among children and adults, these hollow wooden dolls fit one within each other. Exquisitely carved and individually painted, the nesting dolls are always a popular item. RACES SET: Contains a human, elf, dwarf, gnome, and halfling: 2 gp. ADVENTURER’S SET: Contains a warrior, rogue, priest, bard, and mage: 2 gp. MARBLES: A continual favorite among children of all races and ages, these marbles are turned from stone by dwarven craftsmen for their own children, and are superior in weight, durability and smoothness to glass. Available in minnies and shooters, bag of 20 costs 2 gp. 110 Diversions AVATAR SET: Contains Elminster, Adon, Kalimvor, Mystra, and Cyric: 2 gp. HEROES AND RULERS SET: Contains Piergeiron Paladinson, King Azoun IV, Alusair, Mourngrym, and Simbul: 2 gp. FAMOUS WIZARDS SET: Contains Elminster, Khelben, Vangerdahast, Lord Manshoon, and a Red Wizard of Thay: 2 gp. PUPPETS: A source of amusement and amazement for children of all ages, these puppets out of Saerloon have heavy felt bodies and expertly-sculpted, hand-painted heads. In addition to the ones listed here, the Stringpullers guild of Saerloon take special orders, and make marionettes and other puppets as well. If you don’t see it here, ask! Hero puppet with sword Heroine puppet with sword Dragon puppet Trusty halfling puppet King puppet (any resemblance to King Azoun IV of neighboring Cormyr is coincidental) Wizard puppet (likewise for Vangerdahast) Great bard puppet (a personalized rendering of the great Finder Wyvernspur, commissioned by O. Ruskettle) Evil red wizard puppet All puppets are 2 gp, or get three for 5 gp! ROCKING MOUNTS: A wonderful toy for the castle nursery, these wooden rocking mounts from Cormyr are the perfect toy for practicing knight-errants. Available in a number of styles, all at the bargain price of 4 gp. Destrier Pegasus Unicorn Sea Lion Dragon (specify color) 111 Diversions TOPS: These perfectly-balanced tops are from the land of Amn, and made of brass, copper, and bronze. They are available in both solid and “singing” versions, the latter being ringed with holes such that they emit a sharp whistling while they spin. Order either type at 5 sp each, or get a mixed variety of 5 tops for 2 gp. Games CHESS: One of the four universal games (draughts, dice, and talis cards being the others), chess is the most challenging and intriguing of the four, truly the king of games. It is said that kings wage wars in the summer months and practice wars with chess in the winter. Several sets are currently available from our catalog: standard at 20 gp. TRADITLONAL SET: Made of ivory and ebony on a black and white marbled board, this is the most common set available—king, queen, priest, knight-errants, rooks, and pawns are hand-carved and the entire set is carried in a padded teak case. An old AVATAR SET: The main players from the Time of Troubles are represented here in finely carved hardwoods from the Loudwater area. Elminster and Cyric are kings, Mystra and Cyric’s sword the powerful queens, and the rest of the players are portrayed here. SPECIAL CLEARANCE: We’re trying to move these following a string of mysterious fires in the warehouse. A bargain at 15 gp! HORDE SET: Through special permission with the Kingdom of Cormyr, Aurora’s is proud to offer a limited-edition set commemorating the repulsion of the recent Tuigan Incursion. Cast in gilded iron and stone, the set has accurate (and flattering) portrayals of King Azoun IV, Lady Alusair, Vangerdahast, and the Horde leaders and horsemen. A phenomenal seller in the gentle homes of Cormyrean gentry, the Horde set has induced many of these lesser nobles to learn the game of kings! A special value at 25 gp. 112 Diversions DICE: An old staple, one of the four universal games which are common across the known planes, dice are used for a number of purposes ranging from bar-entertainment and gambling to fantasy gaming. I ship my dice in from Turmish, where they are carved from high-grade ivory in standard six-sided, and multi-sided versions. Four six-sided dice with leather dice cup. 3 sp. Assortment of 4, 6, 8, 12, and 20-sided dice (one each type), with leather dice cup. 4 sp. DRAUGHTS: Also called checkers, this game uses the same board as chess, and is found from Neverwinter to Mulhorand and beyond. Where chess is complicated and drawn out, draughts can be learned in moments and quickly played. I offer a set of stone pieces in red and black on a marble board, suitable for those early winter evenings with hearth and friends. A popular game at a popular price—5 gp for the fine set! FIGHTING DOLLS: A popular diversion originating in Ordulin, but becoming increasingly popular as far away as Waterdeep, these foot-high wooden dolls are made of joined finished pieces hinged and mounted on long wands. By manipulating the wands, the doll can be made to move and fight its opponent. A careful blow knocks the opponent’s head off, or caves in its thin metal shield. Crafted of fine Sembian woods and hand-painted, these fighting dolls can provide many evenings of amusement, and Ordulin is famous for its “battle-masters” who have raised this novel toy to an art form. A set of two fighting dolls can be yours for the modest investment of 7 gp. Not recommended for children under 12 due to the sharp points on the swords. Important Note: An earlier order of clockwork fighting dolls has been canceled, and no further orders will be taken. These dolls, from Lantan, staged their own mutiny in Baldur’s Gate, and escaped into the city at large. I deeply regret the inconvenience caused by these defective toys, and have lent all my available resources to capturing and destroying them. To that end, no further fighting dolls from Lantan are 113 Diversions imported (though other clockwork dolls are available, and have been heavily screened to ascertain their harmlessness). OLD MEN’S BONES: The classic game of pick-up sticks made with needle-like slivers of dragons, wyverns, and other fell creatures. Remove the bones from the pile but be careful not to topple the stack! Originally from Phlan and the Moonsea area, our diviners attest that no sentient humanoid bones are in the shipment. Stored in a metal tube for easy storage and available at the low cost of 2 sp. A special version made exclusively of dragon bones is available at 4 gp. TABLE DICE: A game also called backgammon, this is a popular bar game in the Dalelands, and has spread by trade routes through the Heartlands and into the North. Our set is made of polished white and black markers, ivory dice, fine leather dice cups, and carried in a finely-worked case of sturdy ironwood. Make yourself at home in the taverns of the civilized world with a Table Dice set from Aurora’s, at the low cost of 5 gp. 114 TALIS DECK: Fourth of the four universal games, the Talis deck is used for some non-magical divining, but also for a variety of card games, including whist, poker, talison, elemental empires, and old wizard. The deck consists of the four 12-card planar suits (stones, waves, winds, and flames) and the traditional 22-card major arcana (Sun, Moon, Star, Comet, Throne, Key, Night, etc. . . .). The deck offered by Aurora is decorated by illuminators from Candlekeep, where they keep the texts of Alaundo the Sage, and has become the definitive Talis representation in the Realms. Note: This deck is non-magical in nature, but still a bargain at 3 sp! Aurora's Larder In my travels throughout Toril, I quickly learned that a full larder holds far more than tea and cakes. As well as stocking the kitchens of countless merchant-class folk, our larder list is perused and used to provision the highest courts in the land. My agents have traveled far and wide to set up lines of trade with places as distant as the jungles of Malatra and the mysterious stone-city of Tukan, as well as the more familiar sites of the Heartlands.

Every people across Toril has its own bread, from the nomadic Bedine of Anauroch to the exotic folk of Nexal. In my years of adventuring, I tasted many of these breads, typically without the time to get recipes or even pack away a rucksackful. Therefore, when I began my merchandising business, I immediately set up lines to sell many of the exotic and wonderful breads I had tasted in my travels. Here they are, with stories (where appropriate) of how I first encountered them. Breads BLACKBREAD: The sweetest, strongest molasses from Amn is used in our exclusive blackbread. Wastel flour, the finest grind available, forms the basis for these tasty loaves. After the first taste, you will agree that these don’t need any topper! Sold in lots of four; sad to say, we cannot split lots. Blackbread, 4 loaves: 10 sp. CRACKERS: Delightful with tea or other beverages, these crispy tidbits are flavored with the freshest herbs and spices from the Dalelands. Select from Onion, Garlic, Pepper, or Savory, or if you prefer take the Gourmet Pack containing all four flavors. Crackers, herb (three dozen per package): 5 sp/package. 119 ELVEN: Another coup for my catalog! Shipped direct from the legendary Isle of Evermeet, this is the lightest, sweetest, finest-grained bread you will ever taste. Tales are told of its extraordinary nutritional values, none of which I can confirm or deny, naturally. Some even say a secret cache of its been keeping Elminster going these years! I, on the contrary, can only promise your taste buds a delightful sensation with every bite! Elven bread: 2 gp/loaf. nutritional values, indeed! This bread acts as double-strength iron rations, providing twice the food value with half the weight (and many times more taste!) FRUITCAKES: Flavored with rum or brandy from the Pirate Isles of the Inner Sea, and studded with dried fruits (dates, citron, currants, raisins, cherries, and more) and nuts (walnuts, Breads hazelnuts, and filberts), these make lovely accompaniments to afternoon tea. (Let them age long enough, though, and they also make fine missile weapons, doorstops, paperweights, and ballast.) Shipped in a decorative tin, pattern may vary (let us choose for you). Fruitcake: 10 gp, includes tin. including tin. GINGER- BREAD: Top quality ginger from Shou Lung gives this cakelike bread its distinctive flavor. Delicious topped with whipped cream or rum sauce. Shipped in a reusable tin, with my company logo stamped on the lid. Gingerbread: 1 gp, HARD-TACK: Although I cannot conceive why anyone would willingly partake of this dry, bland, flour-and-water, unseasoned biscuit, apparently there are those among my customers who became fond of them during their time at sea. For those who wish to relive those days of glory (and scurvy) I offer this dubious culinary delight. (I use the term loosely.) Stock up. It won’t quickly go bad. Hard-tack: 10 cp/dozen. 120 NOODLES: On his last trip to Kara-Tur, Volo (a peripatetic acquaintance of mine) happened upon several varieties of noodles far superior to those we enjoy here at home. Kozakuran udon, fat, white, and long, are delicious in a broth with bits of cooked egg and onion. Soba, fine, thin, vermicelli-like buckwheat noodles from Wa, are served there in broth made from, of all things, green tea! Bean curd noodles from Shou Lung are made from a protein-source called “tofu,” a curd of soybean origin; they are long, fine, and nearly transparent when cooked, and quite chewy. Ramen, another thin noodle, is very curly and cooks in mere minutes. We offer all of these, in convenient one-pound packages. They have been dried under carefully controlled conditions, and are Breads guaranteed to please. All varieties are priced per pound; order in 1-pound increments only, please, as we cannot split packages. Udon, soba, bean curd, or ramen noodles: 15 gp per pound, includes shipping direct from maker. SOURDOUGH: A curious concoction from the Pirate Isles of the Inner Sea, this bread is made with a bit of dough from the previous batch, left to “go sour” in order to leaven the next batch. It has a pleasantly heavy consistency, and a hard, flaky crust. Sold in 2-lb round loaves, wonderful for use as trenchers at your next feast. (Slice off the top, scoop out the inside, and use the “bowl” that remains instead of your good wooden ones! The leftover bread is fine in bread puddings, stuffings, and the like.) Sourdough, 2-lb loaf: 15 sp. TARTS: Delightful little pastry shells from the bakers of Waterdeep, favorites of Piergeiron Paladinson! These are about a palm’s width across, and are shallowly curved to hold jam, lemon curd, mincemeat, or whatever savories or sweets you care to serve in them. Sold by the dozen, shipped in special wooden crates to minimize breakage. Price includes crate and shipping. Tarts: 15 sp/dozen. TORTILLA: My newest discovery, from the land across the sea known as Maztica! A native grain called mayz is ground between stones, and the coarse flour that results is baked on hot stone “griddles.” The flat bread can be eaten plain, sprinkled with cinnamon and a bit of sugar (if you are lucky enough to have such a thing!), wrapped around spiced, cooked meat, filled with spiced beans and baked in a cheese sauce . . . I have even heard of people who cut the tortilla into smaller pieces and fry them in deep fat or oil, rendering them crispy and crunchy! Shipped direct from the Temple of Helm at Ulatos; a percentage of the sales goes to the temple’s efforts to aid the natives with medical and educational efforts. Tortillas, 2 dozen: 25 gp, includes shipping. 121 Cheese Shop The cheeses of Faerun are as diverse as its cities, and range from the common “holed” cheese of Waterdeep and Cormyrian Cheddar to the spicy Chessentan Lotus and the exotic (and addictive) Luiren Spring Cheese. A quick tour through the various cheeses available in the Realms is a culinary tour of the peoples and cities that we trade with. Cheese is an excellent foodstuff for a long trip or extended visit. It stores well, travels without undue spoilage, and excites even the most common meal. It is equally well-suited to the winter meal by the hearth and the spring caravan trip. Cheese makes a perfect welcoming gift or parting memento. Cheese is sold by the 1 pound loaf or wheel or the 100 lb whey, unless otherwise noted. Buy in bulk and save! ARABELLAN CHEDDAR: The most popular cheddar cheese of the Sea of Fallen Stars, this sturdy, orange cheese is the definitive cheddar from the Dragon’s Mere to the borders of Thay. I order only the best of this cheddar, made in Arabel and shipped from the port of Suzail. Cured Cormyrean cheddar travels extremely well, and is the adventurer’s choice in dependable cheeses; Arabellan is the best of the entire breed. Available in 1 lb wheels (4 sp) or 100 lbs circular wheys (35 gp). CHESSENTAN LOTUS CHEESE: A novelty cheese popular in Chessenta and the old empires that crouch on the southeastern side of the Sea of Fallen Stars, Lotus Cheese is mixed with flower petals. Roses and honeysuckle are commonly used, but after long experimentation Lotus petals have proved both the most exotic, attractive, and long-lasting of the Chessentan cheeses, and I’m proud to offer it here. Available in 1 lb torus-shaped wheels (6 sp) and similarly-fashioned wheys (55 gp). DEATH CHEESE: A deadly little number from the swamps bordering Sembia and Cormyr, it takes its name not from its effect but from the creature it comes from—the deadly catoblepas. This creature can kill with a glance, and the cheese is reputed to come from the services of blind monks who locate their herds by sense of smell. Actually, out of work adventurers are pressed into service to herd and milk these creatures, and the monks do the actual production. A soft cheese with a red paraffin rind, catoblepas cheese is a rich, delicate addition to the dining table, exotic both in its taste and the method by which it is acquired. Available (obviously) only in 1 lb loaves, marked with a stylized imprint of a catoblepas (5 gp). DAMARITE RED: Bloodcheese from the lands of the Bloodstone, Damarite is made of goat’s milk, giving it a sharper, heartier, more pungent tang. The cheese travels well in its heavy, black rind. Not recommended in large quantities, Damarite Red provides that 122 Cheese Shop excellent accent of a snack cheese. Available in 1 lb wheels (5 sp) or 50 lb oblong wheys (20 gp). ELTURIAN GREY: A heavy, whitish sheep cheese with black veins, Elturian Grey is also known as stonework or dwarfcheese. Despite such daunting names, the premiere cheese of Elturel is a tasty, pungent treat. I keep Elturian Grey in my own larder, and spring it on unsuspecting guests who complain about the trade cities. Now that the word of the delightful flavor of Elturian Grey has gotten out, a number of the other trade cities are producing their own versions. These tend to use cow’s milk instead of goat and are sold under similar names (Elturel Grey, Elturel Gray, etc. . . . ). Aurora’s only offers the original Elturian Grey. Available only in 1 lb loaves (6 sp). FARMER’S CHEESE: Also called pot cheese or cottage cheese, Farmer’s Cheese is a simple cheese, little more than aged milk strained through a cheesecloth sieve and drained of most of its whey into large curds. Popular throughout the small farming communities of the Realms, it is usually made and consumed locally, as it does not travel well. An order of Farmer’s 123 Cheese from Aurora’s will result in delivery of the freshest cheese possible, regardless of location. Serve it with salt and pepper for a light meal, or add cream for a rich side-dish with supper. Available wrapped in muslin in 1 lb lots (3 sp). GREEN CALISHITE: Sample at your own risk, for the management accepts no responsibility for those who think this just another cheese. The Calishites mix ground curry in with their cheese as a preservative and flavor-enhancer. And what flavor it has! Many a northern barbarian has been brought low by grabbing a hunk of Green, thinking it an ordinary cheese, and biting in. The curry gives Calishite its radiant aquamarine hue as well, serving as a warning to the uninitiated. Available in ½ lb loaves (4 sp), but special orders may be made through your local station. LUIREN SPRING CHEESE: Also calling Halfling’s Cheese, mind cheese, or cheeeeese, this cheese is available on a limited basis in Waterdeep only, and then only with the express written permission of Lord Piergeiron, Khelben Arunsun, or the patriarch of an established temple. While not the most pleasing of cheeses to the human palate, its effects on Cheese Shop halflings is markedly different, inducing a state in them similar to strong wine. Pungently aromatic and soft, it is normally eaten as an aperitif, though recipes for fondues and pasta do exist which are palatable to humans. In small doses it is less dangerous, but bring a notarized note before even thinking about buying some. Available by the half-pound loaf ONLY, and ONLY in Waterdeep station, (40 gp). Luiren Spring Cheese: Has no effect on any other races than halflings. Effect of 4 oz. amount on halflings: -2 on all proficiency checks and combat rolls, -20% on all thief abilities. Effect of ½ lb or more; as above, plus saving throw versus death or unconsciousness for 1-10 turns. Luiren Spring Cheese causes strong cravings, and the halfling eating it must make a Constitution Check to avoid this effect. Failure indicates need for additional cheese within 24 hours, or else the halfling loses half hit points and suffers painful cramps and hallucinations. USE WITH CAUTION. MIST CHEESE: The Loudwater Vale produces some of the richest cheeses in the North. This soft white cheese is called the Ethereal Cheese by the elves, for if sliced thinly it becomes translucent while retaining all of its succulent bite. Mist cheese owes much of its appearance and taste to its ripening in nearby caves, and the unique taste of Mist has never been duplicated elsewhere. Truly a taste delight! Available only in 1 lb loaves (2 gp). storing unshelled nuts—they mix them into their first-rate cheeses. The nut cheeses of the north are rich, hard cheeses, worth trying in their own right. Hickory nuts, walnut, and chestnuts are ground and mixed throughout the cheese, and the entire wheel is left to ripen. A variety is available, so if you want one from a particular town, say so on the order, otherwise we’ll send you a mixed lot. Variety is the spice of life! Available in 2 lb wheels (1 gp) or 100 lb elliptical wheys (50 gp). PEPPER CHEESE: Much as the North prizes its nut cheeses, Tethyr is known for its spice cheeses, and best known for its pepper cheese, which mixes southern spices in with a mixture of goat and cow cheese to form a tangy, supple concoction. The leathery rind is dotted with peppercorns to give the cheese a unique appearance. The pepper and other spices give the pepper cheese its own unique flavor, perfect with southern dishes. Available in 1 lb loaves (5 sp) or 100 lb wheys (45 gp). 124 NUT CHEESES: The cities of the savage frontier, including Silverymoon, Mirabar, and Sundabar have a unique way of Cheese Shop TURMISH BRICK: A crumbly, square burgundy cheese made with the heavy red wine found in the region. The wine itself travels poorly, but when mixed into the cheese provides a sweet concoction that is popular as far north as Neverwinter. Made in great platters, the Turmish brick is ripened and carved, and each loaf is wrapped in red wax, giving the cheese its common appearance. Available in 1 lb rectangular loaves (4 sp) and 100 gp cubic wheys (35 gp) VILHON BLANC: A light reddish cheese which gains its color and complexion from the lighter wines mixed in during initial straining. Vilhon is a delicate cheese in comparison with Turmish brick, which uses the same procedures but a heavier wine. Vilhon Blanc is rarely found beyond the Sea of Fallen Stars, as the cheese is usually consumed locally, and rarely makes it beyond Sembia. Through special arrangement with the Thousand-Heads Trading Coster, I’m able to offer Vilhon to our consumers at all stations. Give it a try, and you’ll be rewarded with a sweet, delectable cheese. Available in 1 lb loaves (6 sp)—special orders available for larger wheys—contact your local station for more details. 125 WATER- DHAVIAN: Also called eyed cheese, holed cheese, or arrow-shot, this pale cheese has a sharp, tangy bite which would make it instantly recognizable without its unique appearance. A popular and common cheese in the City of Splendors, it is found both in the most common bars and on the richest tables of the nobles. Remember, I sell cheese by weight, not volume, so you aren’t paying for the holes! Available in 1 lb wheels (4 sp) or 100 lbs oval wheys (35 gp) YAK BUTTER: Actually a soft cream cheese made from yak milk, yak butter is found from the Spine of the World to the Hordelands. Yak butter is mild and delicate, but has more character than most cream cheeses, and is excellent with blackbread or elven loaves. I promise to deliver the freshest available yak butter to our customers, but the best always comes in the spring, after the first major thaw. Available in 1 lb earthenware containers (4 sp) or 100 lb wooden tubs (35 gp). Weight of container is not counted in final weight. Wines and Ales Elminster once said, “The heavy wisdom that sorrow teaches is lightened by the pint, and lost by the gallon.” For all the insight in this typically pedantic Elminsterism, I’ve more than once seen the old mage well into his cups. Of course most of us rely upon distilled fare not for its deleterious effects, but for the mere quenching of thirst. Unless one dwells in Vaasa, the High Moor, or the glad halls of Evermeet, water consumption has proven consistently dangerous to health, as well as producing what the dwarfs term “sloshtomach.” By contrast, a strong, almost impenetrable ale scours the palate, pleases the stomach, and lightens the head for philosophical debate. And what ale does in two swallows, wine does in one. As you will see in the next few pages, I am committed to offering a wide variety of distilled fare, with selections suitable for most any palate and purse. I caution that a wise drinker will engage in philosophy but avoid driving beasts of burden. Purchasing Sizes Despite Elminster’s fables about some faraway land where even the most common of drinks are sealed and sold in glass bottles, I can offer only those standard containers adopted by vineyards of Faerun. All of the beers, wines, and other products here are to be found in sizes and packages like these: Hand keg: 12\" long and 8\" in circumference, the hand keg weighs about 10 pounds and carries roughly 2 gallons of liquid. Cask: This small barrel is roughly 2' long and 18\" in circumference, casks carry 12 gallons of wine or beer. Barrel: Generally 3-5' long and as wide around as a healthy man’s shoulders, barrels are the most common container for transporting liquids. Barrels hold 30 gallons. Butt: 100 gallon butts are roughly 6-7' long and wider than a man, a standard purchase size for well-to-do manors, estates, and small castles. Tun: Generally mounted into the wall of taverns with a tap directly into it, a tun holds 250 gallons. 126 Wines and Ales Ales & Beers Nearly every dale, village, town, and city in Faerun has a brewery that makes a local concoction of variable quality and entertains a parochial following among its patrons. But the brews I offer are easily transported or of the finest quality, which makes them worth the time and effort. Though I cannot personally vouch for the taste and judging of these brews (my palate prefers wines, though a sip of Luiren’s Best is a wonder with a bit of nut cheese), my staff vouches for, and dips into, them all. Clearly I can’t stock every brew: selections not offered are limited by travel, supply, or demand. BITTER BLACK: This hearty stout from Arabel is one of that city’s major exports, and deservedly so. Best served at cellar temperature (Arabellans sniff at any other way of serving this drink), the stout is heavy and is jet black with a dark brown head of foam. Hand keg, 3 sp; cask, 2 gp; barrel, 5 gp; butt, 15 gp; tun, 30 gp. DRAGON’S BREATH BEER: A Sembian brew of strong, harsh temperament, Dragon’s Breath is often served with a platter of dark rye bread and death cheese. Hand keg, 12 cp; cask, 6 sp; barrel, 2 gp; butt, 6 gp; tun, 10 gp. ELMINSTER’S CHOICE: This is among our more popular brews, made and shipped from Immersea. Whether its name is authorized by the old dear himself or is just a marketing ploy (the wisdom of this is questioned: any who know the old wizard knows he drinks anything this side of gorgon’s milk), this dark beer, cloudy with yeast and having a heavy head, is of standard quality. Its bitterness leaves a smoky aftertaste, and is preferred by adventurers around the Wyvernwater. Hand keg, 14 cp; cask, 8 sp; barrel, 2 gp; butt, 7 gp; tun, 15 gp. GOLDEN SANDS BREWS: Southern brews, including these Calishite beers, are rare, interesting, and lighter drinks called lager. They are lighter in taste, color, and weight and have more effervescence. Golden sands brews come in varying types, each with different additives to alter the taste of the base lager. These are available only through ports at Baldur’s Gate and Waterdeep, though we will attempt to distribute to a wider clientele in the near future. Prices for all golden sands beers are the same: Hand keg, 2 sp; cask, 1 gp; barrel, 25 sp; butt, 8 gp; tun, 16 gp. The following are the variants of this Calimport brew: Golden Sands Basic: Unadulterated lager with no added flavorings after brewing. It has a pale yellow color, white foam, and light bubbles. Golden Sands Gold: The basic brew specially fortified with extracts from cacti and nettles, giving the beer a sharp, more bitter aftertaste and its deeper golden color. Golden Sands Orange: Braced with flavor of orange and currant, this unique lager has an acidic aftertaste, but is sweeter than the basic lager. 127 Wines and Ales IRIAEBORAN NORTH BREW: This local brew is best appreciated by less-refined palates than my own, but is passing fare for tavern or home consumption. This dark amber liquid has a harsh, bitter aftertaste (sold by Iriaeboreans as “the bite of the north winds”) that is, for many, an acquired taste. The product, when initially brewed ten years past, was placed in any empty barrels ordered from the city; this practice stopped in order to increase the plummeting orders of the cask trade. Hand keg, 9 cp; cask, 5 sp; barrel, 12 sp; butt, 4 gp; tun, 8 gp. LUIREN’S BEST: Brewed by the Smokardin clan of coastal Luiren, this hefty stout is as black as ink and nearly as thick as the snows of the Spine of the World. Possessed of a sweet flavor and a frothy head, this halflings’ brew lives up to its name. Found easily in Luiren, Halruaa, and the Shining South, it is rarely transported north aside from its limited exports to my outlets in Sembia. Hand keg, 3 sp; cask, 2 gp; barrel, 5 gp; butt, 15 gp; tun, 30 gp. OLD ONE EYE: This beer, its containers stamped with a brand of a cyclops’ head, is brewed in Llorbauth on the southern coast of the Deepwash, just north of the Thornwood. The local brewer, a retired half-elf fighter/mage named Araneth Idogyr, learned the recipe from a cyclops he met and, strangely, befriended during the local Goblin Wars of 1358 DR. This relatively new brew is akin to the lagers of Calimshan—lighter and less opaque than the standard stouts of the North, but with a higher alcohol content. Old One Eye’s fiery red color comes from its secret brewing process. (Rumors mention pepper and other minute spices in the grain mix.) Its odd “hot” aftertaste makes this beer a one-of-a-kind drink. It is gaining quite a following among the locals and adventurers south of Cormyr, and tavern keepers like it for its long life and ease of travel. Hand keg, 15 cp; cask, 1 gp; barrel, 3 gp; butt, 7 gp; tun, 15 gp. SHADOWDARK ALE: This frothy ale is almost sinister in appearance, with pale yellow foam atop a cloudy brown bubbly liquid. Despite a daunting demeanor, this ale is excellent, with a light bitter taste. Brewed in Shadowdale, this ale travels easily and is found as far away as Luiren; many adventurers who first tasted this fine brew at the Old Skull are glad to have its familiar taste in any major city’s taverns. Hand keg, 17 cp; cask, 1 gp; barrel, 35 sp; butt, 9 gp; tun, 18 gp. “SUZALE”: This fine-quality ale is specially prepared by the royal brewer of the House of King Azoun IV of Cormyr. Though its proper title is Purple Dragon Ale, the name listed is its most common appellation. First brewed for the royal servants and household of the Palace Royal, Suzale will now spread its nutty flavor throughout Faerun. Hand keg, 3 sp; cask, 2 gp; barrel, 5 gp; butt, 15 gp; tun, 30 gp. 128 Wines and Ales TANAGYR’S STOUT: This product is one of few exempted from trade embargoes against Zhentil Keep: a heavy, pitch-black stout with a low, rich malt flavor—the richest, smoothest, headiest drink this side of Evermead. This drink has long been limited to the Moonsea region, but is expanding its trade farther south, using unmarked barrels to avoid the stigma of its point of origin. Hand keg, 35 cp; cask, 25 sp; barrel, 6 gp; butt, 20 gp; tun, 50 gp. Ciders KNEE- CRACKER: This cider, derived from local pressings of windfall apples, is available in bulk. The nature of local presses leads to a heavy sediment, and the cider should be allowed to settle for at least three days after it arrives at its final destination. Stronger than an ale but weaker than a good wine, this is a robust cloudy drink. Hand keg, 1 sp; cask, 4 sp; barrel, 1 gp; butt, 35 sp; tun, 8 gp. PURPLE HILL CIDER: This clarified cider, prepared in Myratma, comes from a mixture of apples and accent fruits (cherries, plums, quinces, gooseberries) from the Purple Hills orchards of Tethyr. By carefully coaxing further fermentation of the cider must, the vinters have produced a fine, fruity cider with the punch of a strong wine. Hand keg, 4 sp; cask, 2 gp; barrel, 5 gp; butt, 15 gp; tun, 30 gp. VILHON CIDER: Made in Nimpeth on the south shores of the Vilhon Reach, this heady cider is strong in its sweet flavorings of apples, cherries, blueberries, and pears. An exquisite cider, it is best served piping hot with cinnamon or cloves. Hand keg, 5 sp; cask, 25 sp; barrel, 7 gp; butt, 20 gp; tun, 40 gp. Wines ARABELLAN DRY: This fine red wine is very dry and should be served at cellar temperature to best exhibit its woodsy undertones and slightly berrylike taste. Cask, 25 sp; barrel, 6 gp; butt, 20 gp; tun, 48 gp. BERDUSKAN DARK: Berduskan dark wine is a heavy, sweet, and burning wine. It is very dark in hue, almost black, and high in alcohol content. It is highly prized by some across the Realms. Once Berduskan dark was bottled in a cooperative effort of guilds in Berdusk. After a falling out between the Vintners’ and Alchemists’ Guilds, the wine became available in the containers found elsewhere in Faerun. Hand keg, 14 gp; cask, 24 sp; barrel, 60 gp; bottle (when available), 12 gp. BLOOD WINE: Blood wine, a product of Aglarond, has a heavy body and deep-red tone. The taste is lush and full, with a slight afterbite. The wine comes from a shriveled variety of grape 129 Wines and Ales that grows on twisted vines, grapes said to be possessed by the dead who enacted petty cruelties upon others while they lived. True or not, blood wine has a distinctly heavy flavor. Hand keg, 15 sp; cask, 4 gp; barrel, 10 gp; butt, 30 gp; tun, 70 gp. CLARRY: A blend of table wines sweetened with honey and spices, pink Clarry is a treat for any special occasion. Hand keg, 4 sp; cask, 2 gp; barrel, 5 gp; butt, 14 gp; tun 35 gp. EVERMEAD: Evermead is the elven mead—the one against which all other meads (and any other drinks) are compared. A sip is reputed to be a taste of the higher planes themselves. Made according to closely guarded traditional methods in Evermeet and allegedly aged for hundreds of years, very few kegs of Evermead ever reach non-elven hands. Outside of Evermeet, Evermead can be bought only through direct contact with me. Hand keg, 50 gp; bottle, 30 gp. FIRE WINE: This thick, dark, almost black wine made in the Old Empires is named for the fire it creates in one’s belly. Fire wine is an extremely strong and spicy wine, reputed to have medicinal qualities. Hand keg, 38 cp; cask, 18 sp; barrel, 46 sp; butt, 15 gp; tun 38 gp. MEAD: Mead, a delicate, slightly sweet wine made from honey, is slow to ferment and in scarce supply compared to grape wines or those of other fruits. Mead-making is an art, and the vintner must be careful to neither over-yeast his mead, making for a foul taste, nor allow it to grow too hot or cold, killing the yeast and forestalling proper fermentation. The mead offered here is the finest found in the Northlands, as the honey comes from the fantastic honey bees that inhabit the gardens in Neverwinter. Hand keg, 25 sp; cask, 6 gp; barrel, 20 gp; butt, 48 gp. SAERLOONIAN SPECIAL VAT: This pale red wine leaves a tingle on the tongue. While the recipe for Saerloonian Special Vat is rumored to be over half raspberry and strawberry, with some grains added for smoothness and body, many claim this stable and untiring wine’s full-bodied tones come from the special fermenting and aging processes used to make it. Hand keg, 6 sp; cask, 28 sp; barrel, 8 gp; butt, 23 gp; tun, 56 gp. SAERLOONIAN GLOWFIRE: A pale chartreuse wine renowned for its faint luminescence. Glowfire is neither sweet nor very dry, and has a taste reminiscent of summer breezes and pears. Hand keg, 5 sp; cask, 26 sp; barrel, 7 gp; butt, 22 gp; tun, 54 gp. SAERLOONIAN TOPAZ: Topaz’s yellow-amber color is what lends it its name. It is slightly dry and has a nutty quality balanced by bold fruit overtones. Hand keg, 48 cp; cask, 2 gp; barrel, 5 gp; butt, 17 gp; tun, 42 gp. UNDERMOUNTAIN ALURLYATH: A surprisingly sweet white wine with a slightly nutty aftertaste, this wine is a rare and limited annual acquisition. Its wonderful taste and full body are further enhanced for romantic evenings by its prominent silver and green luminescence; it is 130 Wine and Ales stored in ceramic bottles and kegs to prevent its light from fading during transport. Without contacts to its secret creators, one cannot even buy more than a hand keg from Skullport, its port of origin. Although my Waterdhavian buyer will not divulge the location of the winery within Undermountain’s confines, I have translated the elvish name of the wine to mean “Best of the Temple.” Ceramic bottle (1 qt.), 5 sp; hand keg, 30 sp; cask, 8 gp. WESTGATE RUBY: A bold crimson wine with a slightly acid inclination, my Westgate Ruby is ideal for consumption with a hearty stew or beef. Hand keg, 3 sp; cask, 13 sp; barrel, 3 gp; butt, 10 gp; tun 25 gp. WINE, SPICED: Spiced wine, our best from Calimshan and Tethyr, is a taste treat and a sovereign remedy for many ailments, including nausea, cough, and huskiness of the throat. Raisin, cinnamon, fennel, anise, nutmeg, and clove varieties are available. Raisin, fennel, cinnamon: hand keg, 4 sp; cask, 2 gp; barrel, 5 gp. Anise, nutmeg: hand keg, 5 sp; cask, 25 sp; barrel, 6 gp. Clove: hand keg, 6 sp; cask, 3 gp; barrel, 7 gp. WINE, TABLE: This good wine, red or white, is available in bulk as provisioning for a tavern, castle, or manor. I am able to supply it cheaply as shipping costs are kept to a minimum due to numerous local suppliers. Though this wine supplies a merry evening and is unfailingly tasty, I cannot vouch for its even and consistent quality due the nature of local suppliers. Hand keg, 3 sp; cask, 12 sp; barrel, 25 sp; butt, 8 gp; tun, 20 gp. WINTER WINE: This unusual wine indigenous to the North is a purplish-blue hue, often leading to jokes that the grapes that go into making it “caught a chill.” This is quite true, as the grapes are allowed to freeze on the vine. They are then harvested and crushed while still frozen. Winter wine is very strong and sweet, and is usually served in small quantities as a dessert. The Chessentan berries that give it the blue tinge also lend it a unique spicy tone. Hand keg, 7 sp; cask, 33 sp; barrel, 8 gp; butt, 26 gp; tun, 65 gp. 131 Exotics Among my favorite offerings, each of my exotics comes from a distant land and a fascinating people. More than any other section in my catalogue, this list of exotics showcases the finest and oddest products of Toril. In my journey to Maztica, I discovered that the Nexalan product tabacco (or tobacco) is far and away superior to our pipe weed. When questing through Shou Lung, I learned to appreciate the wonders of their candies, which have a subtle sweetness that can be more satisfying than the overwhelming flavor of Selgauntan candy. Perhaps the exotics I offer here will allow you to relive your own journeys, or perhaps awaken in you a hunger to travel to these distant lands. CHILIS: Without comparison throughout Toril, this spice can be compared most similarly to Malatran pepper, though much greater in bite to the tongue. These Maztican spices can easily conceal the flavor of even the worst meat. We offer these as strings of whole dried pods or ground spice. (100 gp/lb whole; 20 gp/oz ground) CIGARS: Made from the rolled leaves of Nexalan tabacco (something never possible with pipeweed), the cigar is an indescribable smoking pleasure. Rich and pungent, these are among the latest fashion of those returning from Maztican shores. (10 gp each) COCOA: This Maztican product has become quite the rage among the wealthy of Calimshan with little shops devoted entirely to the drink now opening. Mixed with water in the Maztican manner, the powder forms a bitter and stimulating tonic, reputed to restore energy and romantic prowess. (100 gp/lb.) COFFEE: Though long familiar in the lands beyond Eastern Shaar, this beverage has gone all but unrecognized in the north. The dried beans are imported at great expense from distant Durpar and then carefully roasted and ground. Infused in hot water, coffee brews a stimulating tonic, excellent for combatting weariness and enhancing mental acuity. (50 gp/lb.) FAGARA: This spice comes from the forbidding interior of T’u Lung where few western travelers, save myself, have ventured. Similar in size and flavoring to peppercorns, fagara possesses the unique addition of a mild tingling numbness. So powerful is the effect that a little will serve for even the largest dish. (100 gp/lb.) GARUM: I first became acquainted with this salty sauce of fermented fish and other flavorings in the jungles of Malatra, where it was used to add tang to all manner of dishes. Now, using a recipe brought back from the far reaches of the east, I am able to offer this 132 Exotics superior condiment for use at your table. (10 gp/gal.) KETJAP: From the eastern lands beyond Durpar comes a new flavor wonder. There in the kitchens of caliphs and viziers, the chefs of Durpar created a new condiment using the exotic new fruits of Maztica. Now, for the first time in the west I offer the results of their efforts—ketjap. This thick, spicy condiment is the perfect addition to grilled and roasted meats, adding flavor to an otherwise plain meal. (20 gp/pt.) LITCHI FRUIT: Served to emperors in the courts of Shou Lung, this unusual fruit is not available in the West. I offer this rare fruit in two forms; dried, so that it is not dissimilar to Imnescarian dates, and preserved in syrup, so the fruit retains all its tender sweetness. (50 gp/lb dried; 10 gp/pt. preserved) LONG BEANS: This tender-podded vegetable grows rampant in Maztica and is used in households rich and poor. Sweet and crisp when fresh, the long green beans can also be dried or pickled for nutritious winter fare and in this form brought back to Toril. I have imported both varieties and now am pleased to be the first to offer this wonder of the new world. (Dried beans 100 gp/lb.; pickled beans 10 gp/qt.) POTATO: Far superior to the northern root that bears the same name, the Maztican potato (or batata) is larger, firmer, and stores better. Trial plantings indicate the plant grows well in poor conditions, an asset for every farmer with small acreage. From my fresh tubers and rootstock you can propagate your own garden. (20 gp/lb. rootstock) RICE CANDIES: Imported from distant Shou Lung, these candies are certain to appeal with their gelatinous chewy texture and tart flavor. Flavored with essences of exotic fruits and flowers, these will certainly appeal to young and old alike. (100 gp for 100 pcs., assorted flavors) SOYA SAUCE: Since bringing back the secret of this sauce from distant Shou Lung, Aurora’s Authentic Soya Sauce has graced the tables of kings and princes, enchanted by its unique flavor. Not wishing to deny its wonderful flavor to any valued customer, I have now made soya sauce available to everyone. Order today and discover what wonders it does to soups and stews. (15 gp/qt.) TABACCO: Dark and sweet-scented, this Nexalan leaf can be used for the same purposes as common pipeweed. However, there all comparison ends, for 133 Exotics pipeweed cannot match the rich, full flavors of true Nexalan tabacco (or tobacco). I sell only the finest tabacco, imported directly from Nexal and packed in sealed pots to retain all its true flavor. Every pot comes with a complimentary churchwarden so that you need not delay your enjoyment. (100 gp/lb.) TEA: In my travels to the outlying parts of Shou Lung, I had the pleasurable opportunity to become familiar with refined practice of tea drinking. Similar in concept to our herbal infusions, the Shou have raised tea drinking to a fine art. Through special arrangement, I am now able to offer a variety of Shou teas, invigorating and yet soothing at the same time. Pale Jade is our most popular variety, subtle in flavor and color, while for those who prefer a stronger taste, Earth Dragon’s Eye will satisfy. (Pale Jade: 20 gp/lb.; Earth Dragon’s Eye 50 gp/lb.) TOMATO: During my journeys in Maztica, I had several opportunities to taste this unique crop fresh-picked. While this delicate red fruit cannot survive the long journey across the ocean, it can fortunately be dried, which only intensifies the sweetness of its flavor. Packed in oils, dried tomato can be used in soups, salads, and candies. (10 gp/pt.) VANILLA: Words cannot describe the delicate flavors of this wondrous spice, certain to become a favorite throughout all Toril. From the deep jungles of Maztica comes this strange bean of exotic orchids, hand-picked by natives of those distant lands. I import only the finest beans, sealed in individual vials to preserve the delicate essences.

Those bent on adventure will find themselves more often than not among the trees and grasses instead of the streets and buildings. Our compact wilderness gear can provide adventurers a home in most any environment without encumbrances that stop adventurers in their tracks. What could be more comforting to the wayfarer than a sturdy tent to turn the chill winds of Icewind Dale or the insects of Chult? Many times on my adventures I longed for such helps. Gear BEDROLL: One of the most important parts of any adventurer’s day is restful, healing sleep. Staying warm and dry is essential to getting a good night’s rest, so we offer a special adventurer’s bedroll that is easy to tote, yet durable and heavy duty. It is designed as a sack that is long enough to hold a human, with special eyehooks down one side for quick entrance and egress. The bedroll is multi-layered, with an outer layer of soft leather for waterproofing, and an inner layer of flannel cotton from Maztica for warmth and softness. In between, loosely spun wool padding creates a layer of insulation for superior warmth. It will keep you warm on some of the coldest nights, and you won’t lose any sleep over the price—just 20 gp. For the warmer climes, we also offer a thinner version, without the wool padding: 17 gp. CANTEEN, WINESKIN, FLASK: Keep plenty of fluids handy when you’re on your own in the wilderness with our collection of skins and canteens. We offer a basic one gallon water- or wineskin, made of sheep’s bladder (8 sp), as well as a larger three gallon skin for you really thirsty folk (2 gp). We also would like to tell you about a new item, a personal canteen. This is a stoppered wooden tank, lined with sheep’s bladder and covered in thick wool. It holds one-half gallon, but will keep your drink cold longer. A handy shoulder strap is attached for easy carrying, and it is better protected against bursting if dropped. This nifty device is available for 5 gp. CLIMBING GEAR: If you’re going to be doing some serious mountaineering, you’re going to need some serious equipment. You may pick and choose from the list below, or purchase a special package that provides a typical set of gear for one person. down. 15 gp each. ASCENDERS: These are special hand grips that will roll one direction (up) on a rope, but have a pinching brake, to keep them from sliding back 135 Wilderness Gear CARABINIERS: These are simply closed clips that can be used to hook together items, like a looped knot in a rope to an eyelet on a spike. 10 gp each. DESCENDERS: These are also called brake bars, and are used to halt a person who is sliding down a rope. The rope is woven into five or six crossbars, and adjustments to the level of friction can be controlled during descent. 15 gp each. his rope. 20 gp/set. HARNESSES: These are special straps that wrap around the legs, trunk, and sometimes shoulders, to keep a climber attached to ICE AXE: This is used to climb slick surfaces, like ice and hard snow. 10 gp. ice axe is equivalent to horseman’s pick except for weapon proficiencies; military pick cannot substitute for an ice axe in climbing PULLEYS: A pulley will help lift heavy items with rope by increasing leverage, and will also let items roll across horizontally tied ropes (across a chasm, for example). 15 gp each. any adventurer with Mountaineering proficiency should have these items to use his proficiency; DMs not using proficiencies may assign a +10% to climbing success rates (DMG Table 65) FIREGRATE: When you’ve come to the end of a long hike, and are ready for a hot meal, this miniature firegrate is perfect. It is a simple iron rack, about 6 inches by 12 inches, with a set of hinged legs on both ends. Simply swing the legs away from the rack, and it looks like a table, ready to hold your cookpot while it stands over the fire. Includes an iron prod for moving hot pots. 3 gp. HAMMOCK: On those comfortable nights, when it’s not too cold, you can tie your hammock up between two trees. Woven from hemp rope, this sturdy sleeper comes with a drawstring carrying satchel. Also good for keeping packs and food up off the ground, away from scavengers. 5 gp. 136 Wilderness Gear HORNS: Don’t ever get lost when separated from your companions, again. With these miniature horns, you can signal your position easily, to be found, or to let the group know that it’s okay to follow. Set up simple codes, and keep your group on track. 4 gp for a set of five. INSECT NETTING: The jungles of Chult are teeming with biting insects, but it’s too hot to sleep in a bedroll in a tent. Use this material to set up a canopy to protect yourself from constant aggravation, without losing the benefit of the breeze. The net is made of silk, so it’s very light in your pack. 300 gp for a section 10' by 20'. MESS KIT: Now, all of your eating utensils are in one, easy-access kit. Inside a small cooking pot is packed a collapsible leather cup, a plate, a spoon, and three stoppered seasoning vials in a padded leather pouch. A small leather strap keeps the lid on the pot during transport. 8 gp. POLES: Most of the time, you can cut saplings for your tent or netting. But what if you’re above the timberline, or on the tundra? Take along some telescoping, collapsible poles, just in case. These are made of steel, but well worth the price of 20 gp for a set of six. R ATION PACKS: This is handy when you don’t have time to stalk and kill your own food in the wilds. Each meal is wrapped in waxed parchment, then wrapped in sackcloth and tied with string. There are a variety of combinations, but each meal includes a hard roll, a slice of dried cheese, some dried fruit, some seasoned jerky, and some sort of tuber or root vegetable, like a potato or turnip. These meals usually last for at least two weeks. 10 gp per week’s worth. REPELLENTS, HERBAL: Keep insects away from your campsite with these special repellents. We have candles with oil of citronella that will chase them away (3 gp for a dozen), or a special oil of pennyroyal, which can be rubbed on exposed skin to keep them at bay (5 gp for a flask, 50 uses). 137 Wilderness Gear of leather it’s 1 gp. RUCKSACK: This is a smaller version of the typical backpack, and can be used as an auxiliary pack for additional items. It can be carried over a shoulder, or worn around the waist like a belt, and comes with a special buckling strap for this purpose. Made STAKES: As with poles, sure you can cut your own, but not if there’s no wood. Our stakes are made of high-impact steel, so you can drive them into almost any surface (ice, rock, etc.). A set of eight stakes is 30 gp. STRAPS: No one ever seems to have enough straps. I find that I’m always wishing for one more strap to attach another item to my pack or belt. We have a full range of lengths to choose from, or, we will sell a special strap kit, where you get a coil of leather strapping, and twenty-five self-tightening buckles. You cut the lengths you need. Short straps sell for 7 sp for a dozen, 12 sp for medium, and 1 gp for long. The kit is 2 gp. TENT: Shelter is one of the most important things we need, as creatures, to survive. This two-person tent is made of durable canvas, and includes hemp rope, wooden stakes and poles. This tent costs 8 gp, or you can purchase our bigger six-man tent for 20 gp. TINDER & FLINT: We like to call these our “instant fire starters.” Each starter is wrapped in oiled cloth, and contains wood shavings and a briquette of charcoal. Just touch it to a spark, and it’ll do the rest. 3 gp for a dozen. W ALKING STICKS, STAVES, CANES: I really adore this collection of ornamental and decorative walking aids. We offer everything from a basic walking stick (3 sp), to a fully carved ash staff (8 gp), to silver and gold carved cane heads, some set with gemstones (prices vary). If you just want to go hiking, cut down a sapling, but if you prize fine craftsmanship, you’ll want to get our entire collection. Yes, we will special order personalized cane handle requests. 138 Wilderness Gear Transportation BIT AND BRIDLE: Any horseman will tell you that the difference between a good bit and bridle and a poor one is a stiff neck, an aching back, and a bad temper. Our horse bridles work well both for long journeys and for high-speed chases. This bridle has double checks, a quirt-length end, a padded crown piece and doubled chafe. Without bit: 13 sp; with bit: 15 sp; blinder bridle and bit: 2 gp. provides +1 to Land-Based Riding proficiency when used with saddle HARNESS: Leave behind the plowman’s trappings—our light and sturdy harness can add miles to a horse’s endurance and speed to its gait. Suitable for heavily loaded wagons and fine carriages alike, this harness has a stuffed-bottom pad, blacked Ordulan leather traces and lines, heavily folded breeching, comfortable breast straps, and a blinded bridle. Available in single (3 gp) and double (5 gp) horse draws. We also supply four (9 gp), six (15 gp), and eight horse draws (22 gp), though they must be special ordered. Meant for horses 1,250 lb or less. Larger harness for horses up to 1,600 lb cost half again more. HORSE BLANKET/HOOD: Some of the nicest spots in Faerun are under ice for most of the year; in others the summer never ends. Those who adventure to such spots will want a horse blanket and hood to protect their mounts from wintery blasts, and a fly net for turning back the biting bugs of summer. Our blanket and hood (3 gp) attach together, but can be separated for more temperate climes. Both are made of thick wool to keep the horse as snug as a lamb. Our fly net (2 gp) is made of fine leather for durability and includes tassels to warn off even the nastiest bugs. important to care of horses in these climates; effects of nonuse are DM’s option OARS AND PADDLES: An old saying from the Pirate Isles goes, “The oars in me lifeboat’s worth their weights in gold.” But we don’t charge that much. Our paddles and oars come in 5 ft (1 gp) and 8 ft lengths (2 gp). We also sell oarlocks (1 gp/pr) that can accommodate any of our oars. SAILCLOTH: Since the opening of the magnificent shores of Maztica, sailcloth has become a critical commodity. After a hundred voyages to the golden lands, we have learned what material best withstands the rigors of sun and rain, the sea and its thousand leviathans—even the torches of generals like Cordell! We offer that 139 Wilderness Gear double-thick, clay-steeped sailcloth in 15-yard widths at a price of 1 gp/sq yd. SADDLE, BLANKET, STIRRUPS: Those who think saddles uncomfortable have never ridden a horse bareback. Our saddle (10 gp) is far from uncomfortable, made of the finest blacked Ordulan leather, with elegantly tooled fenders, a single-cinch strap, and a fourteen inch tree. Includes straps for the addition of saddlebags. The saddle rests comfortably upon our contoured saddleblanket (2 sp). adds a +1 to Land-Based used with bit and bridle Riding proficiency when SADDLEBAG: Though some riders let their mounts chafe under a load of bags tied sloppily together, others wisely use our saddlebags. These saddlebags are joined by a double-thick and double wide leather strap that spares the beast the pain of binding ropes. Each bag can hold as much as one rucksack, spreading the weight in kind fashion across the animal’s hindquarters. (2 gp) SLEIGH: You'll not find a wealthy wheelwright north of Neverwinter: wheels either mire in the northern snow or slide helplessly across the ice. Cutters, on the other hand, are another matter entirely. In our sleigh, you can travel north of Icewind Dale until your horse freezes before you will get mired in snow. All of our sleighs have hardwood runners plated with steel, canted frames for stability, broad footboards, and a leather-padded seat. We offer both two-person (200 gp) and four-person (300 gp) models. horse can pull its normal capacity load across ice and snow at ½ normal movement rate; horse can trot but not gallop SKATES: Strapping blades to one’s feet and then propelling one’s self at high speeds across a thin and profoundly slick field of ice that overlies a bottomless and near-frozen lake sounds like a bad idea to me. Nevertheless, skating is all the rage in the north. We offer strap-on skates (3 gp) that can turn any stiff-soled 140 Wilderness Gear footwear into instant skates. We also offer skates in the typical shoe sizes: gnome for 7 gp, halfling for 8 gp, elf for 9 gp, and human for 10 gp. (new) Skating proficiency takes 1 slot in general group—(Dex/0); nonproficient move at ¼ speed SNOWSKIS: One way to make your way across snow-covered wastelands is to ski crosscountry. We sell sets of these skis for all sizes of creatures. They are made of oak, and have special leather straps to wrap around your regular boots. 15 gp with a pair of poles for balance (20 gp for creatures larger than man-sized). (new) Skiing proficiency takes 1 slot in general group—(D/0); non-proficient must move at ½ speed downhill on these skis; provides base move of 36 and requires a Dex check to keep balance; failure does 1d6 dmg and 5% risk of bone fracture WAGONS AND CARTS: Almost as soon as humans and demihumans began shifting their burdens to the backs of animals, animals began shifting their burdens to carts and wagons. Our cart (30 gp) has rugged runners, a solid wooden wheel, and a steel axle. It can carry up to 250 lbs of material. For heavier loads, our wagon (80 gp) works perfectly with our team harnesses. The wagon can hold up to 4 tons of material. WHIP AND QUIRT: Unpleasant though it may be, whips and quirts are sometimes necessary to move a stubborn team or mount forward. Our whip is 20 feet long, reaching even to the first pair of horses in a six-horse team. Our quirt fits comfortably in the hand and can spur any horse on to greater speed. horsewhip: Wt 2; S M; Typ —; Spd Fctr 8; Dmg 1d3/1d2 quirt: Wt 1; S S; Typ —; Spd Fctr 5; Dmg 1d2/1d2 141 Priest in a Poke Of course, true healing comes only by the gods, and gods are notoriously clannish about whom they grant powers to (read “priests”). Occasionally, parties must embark on adventures without a healer in the company, due to either a dearth of priests or a dearth of priestly courage. Therefore, I offer the following healing devices, grouped under the whimsical title “Priest in a Poke” because they are too crude and painful to ever be used by a priest-toting company. Crude and painful, yes, but occasionally life-saving too. In addition to offering the stock supplies such as bandages and splints, we stock tools smuggled from the dark land of Thay, whose inhabitants are more often interested in killing than healing. Though I cannot vouch for the healing effectiveness of any of these items, they remain popular among those desperate folks who travel priestless. BANDAGES: Stanching blood can become a full-time occupation for adventurers of all types. Our fluffy white gauze comes from a Maztican crop and soaks up blood like a sponge. We offer the gauze in 1 inch squares (100: 2 sp) as well as 2 inch wide strips (50 yd roll: 1 gp). to stanch blood per “Hovering on Death’s Door” rule in the DMG; requisite for use of Healing proficiency B ALMS : In the absence of a priest or paladin, party members will pour just about anything down an open wound. Our balm kit is constructed in Scornubel and weighs only 3 pounds. It contains many well-known salves: lemon juice (8 oz), lotus-blossom nectar (8 oz), onion juice (3 oz), pitch (8 oz), sea salt (8 oz), snake dung (2 oz), tea leaves (4 oz), vinegar (8 oz), and wood alcohol (7 cp/5 oz vial). (10 gp) wood alcohol adds 1 hit point; lotus-blossom nectar, pitch, tea leaves, and vinegar have no effect; lemon juice, onion juice, sea salt, and snake dung subtract 1 hit point CRUTCHES: Once a leg is straightened and splinted, the next priority is ambulation. We offer sturdy hardwood crutches in two sizes— demihuman (3') and human (4'6\"). (Elves should order human size.) Each of these sizes is in turn variable by the addition of wood armpit rests of varying heights. When ordering, please specify the size of the crutch and the height of the armpit rest (in inch increments). Demihuman: 4 gp; human: 6 gp; armpit rest (all sizes): 1 gp. allows characters with one wounded leg to move at ½ movement rate; two wounded legs moves 1/6 regular movement (at DM’s discretion) 142 Priest in a Poke CRANIAL DRILLS: Despite their immateriality, headaches and madness can be persistent and torturous. I have found that a mug of ale and a good song can cure most of them, but others swear by the effects of cranial drills. I carry only one type of this suspicious apparatus for draining cranial pressure—a drill with sturdy iron construction and a gnomish ratchet mechanism. Though I doubt the true usefulness of such drills, I am told they can be occasionally effective. Even so, they should only be used by skilled surgeons (or joiners). Can also be used on wood. (10 gp) ½ Dex check required to keep from killing patient; after roll percentiles—1 to 40 lowers Int 2 points, 41 to 70 lowers Int 1 point, 71 to 95 has no effect, 96 to 100 relieves symptoms HERBAL MEDICATIONS: When a priest’s healing touch is miles distant, the healing touch of nature may aid those with illness, injury, or madness. We offer a case containing witch hazel extract (8 oz) for bruises, marshmallow- comfrey oil (12 oz) for burns, dandelion juice (6 oz) for warts and corns, horehound tea (4 oz of leaves) for the croup, garlic powder snuff (2 oz) for nasal ailments, rose hip marmalade (12 oz) for sore throats, marshmallow roots (10 dried) for abscessed teeth, red clover (3 oz) for trench foot, conserve of cowslips (10 oz) for madness. (10 gp) each has a 20% chance to work in one application except conserve of cowslips, whose effect lies entirely with the DM HOOKS AND PEG LEGS: Quite popular among our seafaring clientele, hooks and peg legs are said by pirates to “werk compensatorily by grantin’ in flair what they takes in facil’ty.” We supply demihuman and human sizes, with the latter costing half-again more than the list price: Demihuman Hooks Cost Steel 3 sp Brass 9 sp Silver 9 gp Gold 95 gp Demihuman Pegs Cost Wood 7 cp Steel 7 sp Ivory 2 gp Brass 18 sp Silver 18 gp Gold 170 gp Hooks: Wt 1 lb; S S; Typ P; Spd Fctr 2; Dmg 1d4+1/1d4+1; not magical when bought KNIFE KIT: At times, the only way to reach an ailing organ is to carve up what lies atop it. Though I do not condone such probings, I cannot deny the stories of their occasional success. I have also, heard of many deaths. But, for those few who might be saved, our 143 Priest in a Poke special joint cutters (7 gp) and snips (5 gp) for removing soft, fleshy parts. Our artisans in Procampur assure us that the keen teeth of their blades are perfectly sized for the limb type to be removed. Note that tourniquets and plenty of absorbent gauze should be on-hand for this procedure. These saws are best used upon drunken subjects. can halt rot grubs, mummy rot, etc.; ½ Dex check to apply tourniquet; finger saws cannot be used as weapons; other saws have weapon potential only on sleeping or drugged foes; Saws: Wt 4 lb; S M; Tp S; Spd Fctr 10; Dmg 1d6/1d6; Snips: Wt 3 lb; S S; Tp S; Spd Fctr 7; Dmg 1d4/1d4 SPLINT SET: Adventures quickly lose their spice when broken limbs result. Our splint set weighs only 4 pounds, fits nicely in a pack, and contains all the leather straps and spruce boards you need for complete splinting. (4 gp) best used with limb rod; for those without Healing proficiency, requires ½ Dex check required for proper application; failure does 1d4 points damage TRAIL BOOTS: 145 No trail is easy upon the feet— most produce callouses, cuts, blisters, bulging veins, and even flat feet. For those who suffer from these ailments, we stock trail boots. These ingenious boots contain sandpaper to rub away callouses as you walk, plumes to tickle your feet into arching, and silk pads to absorb the shock of the trail. These all reside upon a hardwood sole that prevents the monotonous flexing of fragile foot joints, and thick leather uppers. Comfortable though they are, I find myself incapable of motion when wearing them. The gnomish cobbler who makes them, however, gets about quite easily despite his injured back. (5 gp) Wt 5 lb; slow movement by half; -4 to Dex when worn; each five days of wear temporarily reduces Con and Str by 1 due to back pain TOOTH WRENCH: Why bother with the torture of strings and slamming doors when you can pull a tooth the safe way? With this tooth wrench, a strong person can rip out even well-rooted molars. Developed by craftsmen of Thay, this ingenious device clamps in place and can pry against the opposing gum for extra leverage. (5 gp) combined Str roll must equal patient’s Con to remove tooth; patient rolls ½ Con to remain conscious Priest in a Poke TOURNI- QUETS: A must for those who plan quests against dragons, beholders, or other limb-swallowing species, tourniquets are light-weight and easily applied. Our tourniquet cloth is durable and absorbent linen, and our tourniquet bar can easily be strapped in place after tightening. (1 sp) for those without Healing proficiency, ½ Dex check is required for proper use; improper use fails to stop bleeding THERIACA: An antidote for many poisons, adventurers often carry theriaca along by the jarful. We offer an 8 oz metal flask, perfect for the rail. (5 gp) 50% effective against class A, B, G, H, and K poisons W OUND PACKINGS: Wounds may be sealed in ways other than bandages. We offer gum, resin, tar, and wax, each in 4 oz quantities and each for 1 sp. application promotes as much infection as it prevents—no game effect 146 DaRoni's Workshop In the wilds outside of High Horn lives a peculiar gnomish hermit named Nadul DaRoni. Hermit though he may be, he does not live alone: his sprawling hermitage is peopled with ramshackle devices of wood and metal, massive and wobbly worktables, racks of unidentifiable tools, and countless bits of curled parchment, which are piled up like snow across everything. Madman, perhaps; genius, perhaps; annoying, most definitely. He cornered me once at an affair Elminster was hosting in Shadowdale and all but demanded admittance to my catalogue. At first I refused him outright, but after continual pestering, I finally took a look at his manuscripts, and was amazed. My curiosity landed me a week later in his workshop where I was subjected to endless anecdotes and theories from the dear old creature. At last, I said that if he were to write up some of his inventions following my format, I would allow him five pages. Next month I received a package with 97 such pages, and have since narrowed them down to a dozen or so. At the outset of this section, I believe it only fair to warn buyers that they must beware of this merchandise. These machines are as untrustworthy as they are peculiar, though all of them smack of a genius little encountered in our world these days. Note that all the items here must be special ordered, with listed prices only vaguely reflecting what Nadul DaRoni will end up charging. And finally, the tight-fisted buyer may as well pass over this section entirely. Remember, too, his Common is not well developed. Mechanisms Clockpieces: It is the mechanisms of time that make kings kings and mortals mortal. We mark time by looking at the sun™s perpetual motion; we watch tides moving with behemoths' rolling slumber on the sea floor; we see stars in their skating watches pass the night. So I think how other thingsŠnot only the sun and sea and starsŠmove with reason in time. Hourglasses use sand through a hole to mark time and time candles use burning of wax. But sand grains have different size and fires have different heats. Things made by thinkers can be more exact. So I built clockpieces of springs and gears and metal-tooled wedges to make true time machines. Some have winders and others have pendula, so tell me what you want. From 75 to 230 gp. all timeclocks lose 1 hour per a number of days equal to the cost in gp 147 DaRoni's Workshop Furnace Wagon: A man sees an ox and knows it has greater strength than he, but lesser wisdom. He uses wisdom to put his burden on the ox. Even more powerful than the ox is the elementsŠearth, air, fire, and water. The elements support the ox and the man. Man is far wiser than the elements. So I try to make a wagon to put the burden of man on the elements. My furnace wagon (150 gp) has a hot fire on it stoked by coal and a man. The fire™s heat pushes the air through the shaft and turns the fan blades. The fans are geared low so they turn many times to move the wheel a little. Works very well down hills. can move its own weight, plus a 200 lb cargo (coal) and a 200 lb passenger at a rate of 4 across level ground; must be pushed up slopes greater than 5 degrees; consumes 200 lb of coal per 8 hours; has 10% chance per hour 4 spontaneously combusting 148 Hand Wagon: Some say my furnace wagon is too dangerous, but I only heard of one person who burned to death. So, if you don™t have an ox or ass and fear of death by fire but still want a wagon, I have a hand wagon. Men are poor beasts of burden, with two legs rather than four and the fear of tipping over always there. I didn™t want a walker before the wagon to hold his own weight and pull the wagon™s and not stumble. So my hand wagon has the rider sit comfortable and pull on loops, using his weight to pull his weight. The work is like pulling himself from a seat, over and over for hours. can propel own weight and driver™s weight at ¼ driver™s str in speed and for driver™s Con in rounds over level ground; extra passenger up to 200 lb halves speed; must be pushed across bumpy ground or up inclines more than 5% DaRoni's Workshop Instruments, Mechanical: The art of music is most strange and not convenient. Sculpture, painting, and architecture last when the artist™s hand leaves the substance, but music stops if the artist™s hand is stilled. So I ask myself how to make the timely music last, and I think of mechanical instruments. I put gears and levers and springs to make music and not fingers. This way a song stays when the bard leaves or the bard can play other instruments along with it. Drum: This mechanical drum (40 gp) has four sticks on pivots that strike the head and return. A turning cylinder has gouges out of its round edge to trigger the stick. Has different cylinder for different music (8 gp each) and cylinder can be wound up on a spring to turn moderate in speed or turned by hand for fast or slow speed. Violin: The catgut rolls over the strings when the crank turns, and the strings go up and down to make different notes with levers inside the soundbox. The violin (95 gp) has different master cranks (20 gp each) per song. Yeoman™s Fiddle: A crank makes the wheel covered with rosin go around against the strings while a set of gears presses the keys. The yeoman™s fiddle (75 gp) can crank or have a spring wind it. It has different wheels for different folk songs (15 gp each). use of one of these instruments by a bard in a marketplace attracts much attention, bringing 3d4 gp, per hour of play; all mechanical instruments have a 10% chance of malfunction per turn 149 DaRoni's Workshop Light Splitter: All creatures of day seek light and fear dark. A gnome on a hill can scare a giant below if his shadow is tall over the giant™s head. A bird above a clear lake passes a shadow in the bottom as great as the leviathan. Water and glass make shadows big by the way they are shaped, and distance spreads shadows far. So I ask myself how to make a machine that makes small shadows big? My light splitter (25 gp) lets candle light go through a glass to straighten it, then past a colored glass stencil, then through another glass, then to a wall. Makes the shadow of the stencil upside-down on the wall. The stencil can be cut to look like a man, orc, horse, whatever. useful for creating diversion or nonmagical illusion; focuses up to 30 feet away; saves per wood or glass, whichever is worse Telescope: The light splitter sends out light; the telescope brings it in. With a glass in a tube, things that are dim are bright, and things that are far are close. Works like two magnifiers put together. The tubes pull apart and you can see far things. The tubes push together and you can see close things. Useful for looking at the heavens and the stars painted inside of them. Good too for the wanderers in the firmament and for the moon to see the creatures there. Helps commanders at back of army to see what happens at front. Comes with stand for 70 gp. quadruples distance and detail of vision at ranges over 100 feet; allows study of moon™s surface and planetary appearance 150 DaRoni's Workshop Flight go to the ether. All people everywhere dream to fly, except maybe dwarfs, but they may not dream at all. So I studied the flight of birds to learn what they do to fly so nice. I looked too at the clouds and winds and storms to see what makes them move in the sky. What I come up with is here and I swear all of them work some, if the flyer practices. So I made the air screw (75 gp) I show here. By turning the crank with your feet, the screw starts spinning in circles above the device and makes a great wind. Will then lift straight off the earth into the sky. Can™t get to the ether, though. to calculate probability of failure per round, subtract str and Dex from PCs weight [e.g. 120 lb - (Str 14 + Con 16) = 90% chance failure per round]; if successful, can rise 10 feet/round; regular falling damage applies for failure; magic that alters weight, Str, or Con affects flight through formula Air Screw: I come up with this idea when I was watching a big whirling storms at sea. A water spout grew up from the sea and started to suck the water out into the ether. I thought maybe if I make a spout like that, I could also 151 DaRoni's Workshop Doubles Wheel: I am fishing on the lake by my house when I see two dragonflies flying with tails joined. Then two more, these with one on top of the other. So I watched and saw how they all liked to fly that way; I thought I should make a machine that would let two people fly together. First I tried the air screw, but another person below the screw caught too much wind. We pumped harder and harder but to no use. The frame broke. The whirling part hit my assistant and so he left. I gave up on the screw. I went back to the dragonfly. I put two wings on each side, like for the dragonfly: two men could make more force. The wings have a pivot over the wheel and a hinge to a coarse screw. One man sits on each side, strapped to the frame. The heavier man steps and pulls on the wheel and the wings go down. The lighter steps and pulls and they go up. (95 gp) chance of failure per round equals average weight minus average Str and Dex [e.g., (130 lb + 90 lb)/2 - ((Str 16 + Str 14)/2 + (Con 13 + Con 17)/2) = 80% chance of failure per round]; when successful, can rise 20 ft per round and move at 15; regular falling damage applies for failure; magical alteration to weight, Str, and Con apply 152 DaRoni's Workshop Heartland Flier: I wished to make also a flier that lets one man fly alone, like the birds do. Lie prone on the heartboard with feet strapped into the stirrups in back and hands strapped to stirrups in front. Push the right foot and sweep with arms to draw wings down. Push the left foot and extend arms to draw wings up. (45 gp) chance of failure per round equals weight minus Str, Con, and Dex [e.g., 120 lb - (Str 10 + Con 16 + Dex 14) = 80% chance of failure per round]; if successful, can rise 25 ft per round and move at 15; regular falling damage applies for failure; magical alteration to weight, Str, Con, and Dex apply Tentfall: Any man who has a linen tent twelve yards square and twelve in depth, he can cast himself off of any great pinnacle and fall without harm. I used this tentfall many times with no harm. 10% chance of failure, checked once; requires Str check to hold on; falling damage applies 153 DaRoni's Workshop Sketches Architectural: I have made sketches of the most important buildings in Faerun. Aurora will duplicate these by magic for any person interested. Cost is 1 gp per sketch, some more. I have Caer Corwell, Caer Allisynn, the Ivy Mansion, the Tower of Ashaba, Valjevo Castle, Redstone Castle, the Temple of Bane, Castle Kilgrave, High Horn Keep, and others. if DM wishes to allow purchase of one of these, see the FORGOTTEN REALMS® Atlas Biographical: I draw portraits (30 gp). Aurora, King Azoun IV, and Elminster are here. I can sketch you. Come to me or give your name and locationŠI might come near. DM™s discretion as to how much time passes before DaRoni comes to town (if at all) 154 Biological: Much can be learned of the world™s outer workings by looking at what it™s doing on the inside. I have done so. King Azoun IV of cormyr has agreed to let me dissect the bodies of enemy dead. My sketches show all the systems of the body: skeletal, muscular, ligamentary, visceral, vital, lymphatic, sanguine, auditory, optic, olfactory, and palatal. The sketches show theory for working of all systems. The sketches also have studies to balance the four humorsŠblood, phlegm, choler, and black bile to thereby correct saguine, phlegmatic, cholic, and bilious natures. Aurora will reproduce. All sketches 4 gp per page. Some more. DaRoni's Workshop Warfare For King Azoun IV I built my great crossbow. He has not used it in battle. In tests it razed walls 3 feet thick and smashed solid towers. It is rolled on six wheels and holds a straight trunk 30 feet long by 2 feet wide. Pine works best, stripped of branches. Dry needles make a slick bed for launching. It must be staked into the ground Crossbow, Great: Most sieges are easy to begin and hard to end. I thought to myself: What siege weapon could break a fortress? what siege weapon could break down a castle door? or fell a tower? or smash a wall to rubble? And I thought: what heavy thing could impact to do this? A boulder? a small brick building? a family of giants? These things are thrown easily by a great catapult, but arc too highly and tumble too oddly to be accurate. I thought: perhaps a tree, if shot like a quarrel, would do such damage. before firing. None should stand in front. 1250 gp structural saving throws for great crossbow: hard stone 14, soft stone 16, earth 17, thin wood 20, thick wood 18; requires 4 horses and 4 men to pull/guide, 8 men and 4 horses to load; does 10d10 + 50 damage to anyone hit 155 DaRoni's Workshop Guard, Casement: I was in a castle where orcs jumped up on the casements and raged at us. I thought how to stop orcs from climbing the casements. I made this machine to sweep the casements with steel blades. They climb atop the casement and lose their legs and fall back on the others. I can build one for youŠ300 gp. Foil, Ladder: Some places have battlements and I thought: how do I stop the orcs from climbing ladders to the battlements? I made this machine for tipping ladders. You wait for the shout on the wall, then pull. I™ll make one for 250 gp. Hurler: This great machine hurls rocks. It is 10 feet high and throws rocks faster than an arrow. The weight twirls the rod where the sling is. It hits the grounds to release the rock. The rock can be up to 20 lb. Buy one for 15 gp. Hurler: wt 20 lb; S L; Typ B; Spd Fctr 15; Dmg 1d10/1d10; ROF 1/3; Hit Prob -3; only useful when staked to ground Missile Thrower: Here is a machine for one man on a wall to fight like twenty. He uses special tongs to put a rock or ball of iron in the cup, then hits it with a mallet. A castle with these stands good on first strike. They are reloaded quick in battle. The ball or rock can weigh up to 25 pounds. I make them in groups of eight for 180 gp. Missile Thrower: wt 125 lb; S L; Typ B; Spd Fctr 15; Dmg 1d10/1d10; ROF 8/2 with 2 rounds to reload; Hit Prob - 3; only useful when installed in castleworks 156 DaRoni's Workshop themselves in battle and how to use their great larger in 10 foot radius; must move at rate of 45 to function; strength. warhorses must be trained for 6 months to use; on natural roll of 20, jams and must be stopped and detangled for 2 rounds Then I saw the men out working to harvest wheat and I thought of this scythe wagon. I have 157 Scythe Wagon: I sit and watch warhorses two types: one with blades in front and one with run into battle and I feel sorry. Their eyes and blades in back. The blades are ten foot and very brains are in front, their throats are showing, sharp. They spin from the wheels of the wagon. their hearts are wide open. Even if they have when they hit somebody, he says REEEEPŠ barding they still have no weapons to use. The what just happened to him. Front: 75 gp; horse, too, is ten times as strong as the man who Back 60 gp. rides and swings his little tiny sword. So I think Scythe Wagon: wt 650 lb; S L; Typ S; Spd Fctr 7; Dmg to myself how to help warhorses fight for 1d10/1d10; Hit Prob. +5 bonus for everything M size or DaRoni's Workshop Wagon, Armored: I once saw a king try Provides AC 0 when upright; moves as top speed of 24; wt to get into his castle past a village crowd. They 400 lb; requires 25 points of Str to turn over set on him with only tools: scythes, hayforks, flails, cudgels. He wore full plate mail and his Wagon, Flailing: Once I made my scythe horse had full barding. Both died in thirty feet of wagon and my armored wagon, I thought to make entering the crowd. They cut of his head and put something that joined the two. That way the it on the pub sign. I wondered if somebody could wagon couldn™t be turned over so easy. So I came be safe going through the crowd. up with these two wagons. One has maces So I made this armored wagon. You sit under attached to the chains and one has morning it and turn the cranks on the sides to make the stars. 90 gp wheels roll. It goes fast on roads or smooth land. provides AC 1 when upright; top speed of 22, mud move at 18 to function; wt 440 lb; with successful attack does 1d6 to Sheds rain. Should still have lots of armored creatures in 4 foot radius; on natural 20, stalls for 1 round; knights with you. Don™t let them turn it over. takes 25 points of Str to turn over 250 gp. 158 DaRoni's Workshop Water Tools Aqualker: Believe it or not, there are spiders who can walk on the water. I saw this and thought how to make me walk on the water like does a spider. So I made my Aqualker, with these cone-shaped pads for the feet and rods for the hands with pads at the bottom. Lets you not sink. Works better for light people. You better not use it in rivers or oceans. 8 gp supports up to 150 lb; works only on still water; allows move at 1/6 normal peed Diving Hood: I thought of how the leviathans swim underwater and spout their air above them. I thought if I could breathe my air like they breathe their air I could move underwater too. So I made this diving hood. The top floats on the water and the tube goes down to a mask you wear. It doesn™t help you see, but does help you breathe. Best if you put rocks in your pockets and wax in your ears. 25 gp allows descent to 20 feet; wearer can move at ¼ normal movement rate Underwater Boat: I saw a boat be stove by a whale. The men on it shouted and shaked their fists and threw harpoons, but the whale dived. I thought if I could make a boat to travel underwater it would help. So I made this. With air and driver and sandbags, submerges. Let out sand to surface. Moves well with flippers on back. if operator weighs over 220, will not surface; moves at ½ regular movement; air lasts equal to operator™s Con in rounds; 10% chance of leakŠcheck once per outing Water Screw: I wanted to have water on the second floor of my house. So I made this screw to bring water up for me. I crank it 30 times and have 5 gallons of water up on top. Works well for filling hot oil containers tooŠworks for any liquid. 75 gp 159","libVersion":"0.0.0","langs":"","hash":"","size":0}
