## Overview

The Cerulean Trench is a massive underwater canyon that many believe was the origin point of [Great Drownin]]. Stretching for hundreds of miles and plunging to unknown depths, its waters glow with an unnatural blue light - pure [[The Cerulean Breath in its most concentrated form. Strange creatures, [Ancient Ruins]], and reality-warping phenomena make it one of the most dangerous regions in [[Aquabyssos|[[Aquabyssos [World Overview]]]].

### The Azure Shelf (5000-7000 feet)

The "shallow" entry area where [[Depth Warden|[Depth Wardens]] maintain observation posts. [[Scout Captain Vera Deepwatch leads expeditions from Outpost Sigma, the last "safe" structure before the true trench.

### The Luminous Drop (7000-10000 feet)

Vertical cliff faces lined with glowing crystalline formations. [The Trencher Folk]] have settlements carved into the walls here, led by [[Elder Whisper-In-The-Dark.

### The Pressure Cathedral (10000-12000 feet)

A region where water pressure creates natural formations resembling gothic architecture. [Mad Prophet Silas the Depth-Touched]] claims to receive visions from [[12 Research here.

### The Void Gardens (12000-15000 feet)

Forests of giant kelp that shouldn't exist at this depth, feeding on the Cerulean Breath itself. [Doctor Silas Voidtouch]] harvests specimens here for his experiments in [[Lumengarde.

### The Unknown Deep (15000+ feet)

No one who has descended below 15000 feet has returned sane. Expedition logs speak of "singing stones" and "the dreaming city."

### [The Drowning]] Gate

Massive stone archway at 8000 feet, covered in pre-drowning runes. Water passing through takes on deeper blue coloration. [[Sage Lysander Deepthought believes it's a portal to the source of the flooding.

### The Memory Streams

Currents of pure Cerulean Breath that show visions of the past to those who swim through them. Highly addictive and mentally dangerous.

### The Titan's Graveyard

Collection of massive skeletons from creatures that shouldn't exist. [Beast Master Krell Chainbreaker]] claims one skeleton is still partially alive.

### The Echo Chamber

Natural formation that amplifies sound across impossible distances. [[Free Current|The [Free Current]] uses it to send coded messages.

### The First Temple

Partially collapsed structure that predates the drowning by millennia. Contains references to "the sleeping one" and "the necessary flood."

### The Trencher Folk

Humans who have adapted to extreme depths through disturbing modifications. They worship the trench itself and trade depth-crystals for supplies.

### Cerulean Spawn

Creatures mutated by concentrated exposure to the Cerulean Breath. Includes:
- Glass eels that can phase through matter
- Pressure sharks that implode their prey
- Thought-jellies that feed on memories
- Depth angels (origin unknown, possibly hallucinations)

### [[The Lost Expeditions

Various [Groups]] that went too deep and never returned, occasionally spotted as ghostly figures in the blue glow.

## Current Activity

1. Increased creature migrations toward the surface
2. The blue glow intensifying over past months
3. [[Order of the Sunken Crown]] expedition hasn't returned
4. Tremors suggesting something massive moving below
5. Trencher Folk fleeing upward, refusing to say why
