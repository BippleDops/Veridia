# Captain Echo
*The Voice That Speaks for the Drowned*

> *"They say the dead cannot speak, but I hear their voices in every current, every whisper of the deep. The drowned have much to tell us, if only we have the courage to listen."*
> â€” Captain Echo, addressing her crew before a dangerous mission

## Overview

**Captain Echo** stands as one of the most enigmatic and effective naval commanders in [[Aquabyssos]], leading the specialized vessel *Resonance* on missions into the deepest and most dangerous waters of the realm. Her unique ability to hear and communicate with the voices of the drowned has made her invaluable for both military operations and supernatural investigations, though it has also marked her as someone to be both feared and respected.

Born during the legendary **Echoing Storm** thirty-five years ago, Echo was one of only three survivors from a merchant vessel that was pulled into supernatural waters during a massive temporal-magical disturbance. The experience left her fundamentally changed, able to perceive and interact with the echoes of those who have died in the depths, making her a bridge between the living and the drowned.

Her command of the *Resonance*, a specialized vessel equipped for deep-sea operations and supernatural encounters, has become legendary among both the [[Deepwatch Guard]] and the broader naval community. Under her leadership, the ship has successfully completed dozens of missions that other commanders would consider impossible, from rescuing survivors of supernatural disasters to investigating ancient mysteries hidden in the deepest trenches.
