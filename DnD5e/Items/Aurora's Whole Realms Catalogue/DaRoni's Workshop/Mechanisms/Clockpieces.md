## Description
It is the [[Mechanisms|mechanisms]] of time that make kings kings and mortals mortal. We mark time by looking at the suns perpetual motion; we watch tides moving with behemoths' rolling slumber on the sea floor; we see stars in their skating watches pass the night. 

So I think how other thingsnot only the sun and sea and starsmove with reason in time. Hourglasses use sand through a hole to mark time and time [[Candles|candles]] use burning of wax. But sand grains have different size and fires have different heats. Things made by thinkers can be more exact. 

So I built clockpieces of springs and gears and [[Metal|metal]]-tooled wedges to make true time machines. Some have winders and others have pendula, so tell me what you want. From 75 to 230 gp. all timeclocks lose 1 hour per a number of days equal to the cost in gp
