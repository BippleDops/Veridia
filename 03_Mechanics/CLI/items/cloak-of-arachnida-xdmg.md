# Cloak of Arachnida
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  



This fine garment is made of black silk interwoven with faint, silvery threads. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits.

## Poison Resistance

You have [Resistance](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to Poison damage.

## Spider Climb

You have a [Climb Speed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/climb-speed-xphb.md) equal to your [Speed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) and can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

## Spider Walk

You can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were [Difficult Terrain](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb.md).

## Web

You can cast [Web](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/web-xphb.md) (save DC 13). The web created by the spell fills twice its normal area. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
