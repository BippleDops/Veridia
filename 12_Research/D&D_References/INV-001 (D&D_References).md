## Overview
INV-001 represents the inaugural investigation conducted by inter-realm authorities into anomalous phenomena affecting both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. This foundational case involved the mysterious synchronization of tidal patterns with surface weather systems, leading to the discovery of previously unknown magical connections between the realms.

### Duration
Official investigation lasted six months, with ongoing implications for current policy.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Case Review**: Characters investigate discrepancies in original findings
2. **Copycat Phenomenon**: Similar patterns emerge requiring new investigation
3. **Classified Evidence**: Discovery of suppressed evidence from original case

## Campaign Use
Provides historical foundation for investigation-based adventures and inter-realm cooperation storylines.

## Player-Facing Summary

INV 001 is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of INV 001 as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around INV 001.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
