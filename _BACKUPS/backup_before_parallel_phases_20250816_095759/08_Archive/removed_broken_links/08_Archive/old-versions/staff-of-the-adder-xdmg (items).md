--- # Staff of the Adder

*Staff, weapon, uncommon (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/staff-of-the-adder.webp#right) - **Damage**: - One-handed: `dice: 1d6` bludgeoning - Two-handed: `dice: 1d8` bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[item properties#Versatile|Versatile
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs. As a [Action Xphb]], you can turn the head of this staff into that of an animate, venomous snake for 1 minute or revert the staff to its iimate form. When you take the [[actions#Attack|Attack action, you can make one of the attack rolls using the animated snake head, which has a reach of 5 feet. Apply your [Proficiency Xphb]] and Wisdom modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes`d6`Piercing damage and``dice: 3d6``Poison damage. The snake head can be attacked while it is animate. It has AC 15, HP 20, and [[immunity-xphb (variant-rules) to Poison and Psychic damage. If the head drops to 0 [hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]], the staff is destroyed. As long as it's not destroyed, the staff regains all lost [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] when it reverts to its iimate form. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 310* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Staff of the adder xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
