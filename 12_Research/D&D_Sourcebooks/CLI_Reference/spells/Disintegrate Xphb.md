# Disintegrate
*6th-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a lodestone and dust)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You launch a green ray at a target you can see within range. The target can be a creature, a nonmagical object, or a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by [[Wall of Force Xphb]].

A creature targeted by this spell makes a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes `10d6 + 40` Force damage. If this damage reduces it to 0 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]], it and everything nonmagical it is wearing and carrying are disintegrated into gray dust. The target can be revived only by a [[True Resurrection Xphb]] or a [[wish-xphb (spells)]] spell.

This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or a creation of magical force. If such a target is Huge or larger, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-[[Cube Area of Effect Xphb]] portion of it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `3d6` for each spell slot level above 6.

**Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]
