## Description
In a time of prosperity like this one, when a man may well have two asses and ten oxen, a branding iron is a welcome tool. We offer irons in every letter of the alphabets (specify Thorass, Espruar, or Dethek and character when ordering). For an added 5 gp, a personal crest can be fashioned and mounted upon the branding iron. By combining characters, every husbandman can leave a distinct mark. (8 gp)
