# Sleep
*1st-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sand or rose petals)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each creature of your choice in a 5-foot-radius [[Area of Effect Xphb]] centered on a point within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] condition until the end of its next turn, at which point it must repeat the save. If the target fails the second save, the target has the [[conditions#Unconscious|Unconscious]] condition for the duration. The spell ends on a target if it takes damage or someone within 5 feet of it takes an action to shake it out of the spell's effect.

Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, or that have [[immunity-xphb (variant-rules)]] to the [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] condition automatically succeed on saves against this spell.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
