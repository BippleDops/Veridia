## Lair actions
_Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Zariel can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; she can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- Zariel casts [[major-image-xphb|major image]] four times at its lowest level, targeting different areas with the spell. Zariel prefers to create images of intruders' loved ones being burned alive. Zariel doesn't need to concentrate on the spells, which end on initiative count 20 of the next round. Each creature that can see these illusions must succeed on a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw or become [[conditions#frightened|frightened]] of the illusion for 1 minute. A [[conditions#frightened|frightened]] creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- Zariel casts her innate [[fireball-xphb|fireball]] spell.  

## Regional effects

The region containing Zariel's lair is warped by her magic, which creates one or more of the following effects:

- The area within 9 miles of the lair is filled with screaming voices and the stench of burning meat.  
- Once every 60 feet within 1 mile of the lair, 10-foot-high gouts of flame rise from the ground. Any creature or object that touches the flame takes 7 (`2d6`) fire damage, though it can take this damage no more than once per round.  
- The area within 2 miles, but no closer than 500 feet, of the lair is filled with smoke, which causes the area to be heavily obscured. The smoke can't be cleared away.  

If Zariel dies, these effects fade over the course of `d10` days.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
