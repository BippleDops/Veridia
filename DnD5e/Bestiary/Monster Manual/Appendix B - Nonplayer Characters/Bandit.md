## Description
**Bandits** rove in gangs and are sometimes led by [[Thug|thugs]], [[Veteran|veterans]] , or spellcasters. Not all bandits a re evil. Oppression, drought, disease, or famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry.

**Pirates** are bandits of the high seas. They might be freebooters interested only in treasure and murder, or they might be privateers sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation's vessels.
