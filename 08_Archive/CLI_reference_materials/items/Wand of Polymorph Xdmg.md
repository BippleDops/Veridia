# Wand of Polymorph
*Wand, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/wand-of-polymorph.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 charge to cast [Polymorph](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/polymorph-xphb.md) (save DC 15) from it.

## Regaining Charges

The wand regains `1d6 + 1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll `d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.
