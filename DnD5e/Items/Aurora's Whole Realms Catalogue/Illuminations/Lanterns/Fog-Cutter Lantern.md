## Description
After a friend of mine spent some time on the coast at a lighthouse, he brought back with him a lantern which he found useful in cutting through the frequent sea fogs. The fog-cutter is an adaptation of the design of that lantern, and is a variant on the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Illuminations/Lanterns/Bullseye Lantern|bullseye lantern]]. It features a glass focussing lens of an amber color which illuminates an area better in foggy conditions than a standard bullseye or hooded lantern (15 gp).

## Additional Details
A fog-cutter’s light reaches 60 feet, with an addition 20 feet of semidarkness. In the fog, its light reaches 30 feet, with an addition 10 feet of semidarkness (as opposed to a normal light source which is cut by two-thirds in fog). A fog-cutter burns six hours per pint [[Canteen|flask]] of oil, and holds one pint. If a referee is using the optional degrees of darkness found on page 119 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide, within the illumination path of the fog-cutter, moderately foggy conditions are treated as clear, and densely foggy conditions are treated as moderately foggy.
