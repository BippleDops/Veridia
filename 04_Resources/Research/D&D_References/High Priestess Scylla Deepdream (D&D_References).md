Once a surface world oracle who foresaw the Great Drowning, Scylla chose to drown herself ritually to gain the power to shape it. Now barely recognizable as having been human, she leads the Wake faction in their mission to awaken Thal'mexis and drown the surface world completely. She speaks only in prophecies and views linear time as a quaint limitation. ## Abilities & Stats

4. Seeking to corrupt one of the Seven Shards ## DM Notes

Scylla represents the alien horror of Aquabyssos—someone who chose transformation and can't understand why others resist. Her temporal abilities make her nearly impossible to surprise or defeat conventionally. She should feel like a force of nature rather than a person, speaking in paradoxes and prophecies that come true in unexpected ways. Her genuine belief that she's saving the world through drowning makes her sympathetic yet terrifying. ## Player-Facing Summary High Priestess Scylla Deepdream is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of High Priestess Scylla Deepdream as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around High Priestess Scylla Deepdream. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
