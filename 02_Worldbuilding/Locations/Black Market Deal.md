## Overview

The Black Market Deal represents an ongoing network of illicit transactions and underground commerce that thrives in Aquabyssos's hidden corners. As political tensions escalate, the black market has become increasingly important for acquiring restricted items, information, and services that the various factions need but cannot obtain through official channels.

This underground economy operates in the spaces between legitimate authority - abandoned pressure tube stations, forgotten maintece tunnels, and neutral territory where official faction control is minimal. Deals range from simple smuggling operations to complex exchanges involving magical artifacts, restricted information, and services that could shift the balance of power in the city.

The black market serves multiple functions: providing necessary goods during shortages, enabling communication between hostile factions, and creating opportunities for both legitimate [Merchant]]s and criminal enterprises to profit from the city's instability.

### Phase 1: [[Introduction to the Underground

**Objective**: Make contact with black market operators
- PCs are approached by a desperate merchant, faction representative, or private citizen needing something unavailable through legal channels
- Introduction to the complex network of signals, passwords, and meeting protocols
- First contact with low-level brokers who evaluate the PCs' trustworthiness and capabilities

### Phase 2: Proving Worthiness

**Objective**: Complete a trial transaction to establish credibility
- PCs must successfully complete a relatively simple deal to prove they can handle black market protocols
- Opportunities to demonstrate discretion, capability, and reliability
- Introduction to the various types of goods, services, and information available

### Phase 3: The Major Deal

**Objective**: Facilitate or participate in a significant black market transaction
- High-stakes deal involving valuable or dangerous items that could affect the city's political balance
- Multiple complications: rival bidders, faction interference, security threats, or betrayals
- Moral choices about supporting various sides or maintaining neutrality

### Phase 4: Consequences and Connections

**Objective**: Deal with the aftermath of the major transaction
- Investigation by authorities or rival factions
- New opportunities or threats based on the PCs' actions
- Permanent connections to the black market network for future adventures

### The Neutral Depths

Abandoned sections of the city's lower levels where faction control is minimal and black market activity flourishes.

### The Shifting Market

Mobile trading posts that move location regularly to avoid detection, using coded signals to inform customers of new meeting points.

### Safe Houses

Secure locations where high-value transactions can take place with reduced risk of interference.

### The Drop Points

Hidden caches throughout the city where goods and payments can be left for later collection.

## Moral Considerations

The black market presents complex ethical choices:
- Supporting illegal activities vs. helping desperate citizens obtain necessities
- Maintaining neutrality vs. using black market connections to support preferred factions
- Balancing profit motives with social responsibility
- Dealing with criminal elements while avoiding corruption

## Long-term Consequences

Participation in black market activities can lead to:
- Permanent connections with underground networks providing future adventure opportunities
- Reputation changes affecting relationships with official authorities and factions
- Access to rare items and information unavailable through legal channels
- Potential legal consequences if discovered by authorities
- Moral complications from association with criminal activities

## Adventure Hooks

1. **The Desperate Diplomat**: A faction representative needs the PCs to acquire restricted magical components for a critical defensive system, but official channels have been blocked by [Political Maneuvering]].

2. **The Missing Shipment**: A valuable black market cargo has disappeared, and multiple factions are secretly searching for it. The PCs must navigate competing interests to recover it.

3. **The Double Agent**: A prominent citizen is using black market channels to secretly support an opposing faction, and the PCs must decide whether to expose them or protect their operation.
