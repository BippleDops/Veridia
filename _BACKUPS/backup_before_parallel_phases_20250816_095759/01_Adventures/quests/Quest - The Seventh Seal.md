**Difficulty**: Moderate (Levels 3-5)

The Order of the Shattered Crown has discovered that each party member bears an invisible "Seal"—a magical mark that connects them to one of the Seven Shards. These Seals are awakening, granting power but also making them targets for those who would use them to reunite the Crown of Stars. The party must decide whether to embrace, remove, or master these marks before they consume them. ## Quest Hook

[[The Crimson Sage|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage appears to each party member in individual visions, revealing glowing marks on their souls that pulse in rhythm with distant Shards.
