--- # Shadow-Touched

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 207* **Prerequisite**: 4th Your exposure to the Shadowfell's magic grants you the following benefits. **Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20. **Shadow Magic.** Choose one level 1 spell from the Illusion or Necromancy school of magic. You always have that spell and the [[see-invisibility-xphb (spells)]] spell prepared. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either spell in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells' spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Shadow touched xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
