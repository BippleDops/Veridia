--- ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Blindsight

_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 361. Available in the SRD_ If you have Blindsight, you can see within a specific range without relying on physical sight. Within that range, you can see anything that isn't behind [[Cover Xphb even if you have the [conditions#Blinded|Blinded]] condition or are in [[darkness-xphb (variant-rules). Moreover, in that range, you can see something that has the [conditions#Invisible|Invisible]] condition. ## Darkvision

_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 365. Available in the SRD_ If you have Darkvision, you can see in [[Light Xphb within a specified range as if it were [Light Xphb]] and in [[darkness-xphb (variant-rules) within that range as if it were [Light Xphb]]. You discern colors in that [[darkness-xphb (variant-rules) only as shades of gray. ## Tremorsense

_Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 377. Available in the SRD_ A creature with Tremorsense can pinpoint the location of creatures and moving objects within a specific range, provided that the creature with Tremorsense and anything it is detecting are both in contact with the same surface (such as the ground, a wall, or a ceiling) or the same liquid. Tremorsense can't detect creatures or objects in the air, and it doesn't count as a form of sight. ## Truesight If you have Truesight, your vision is enhanced within a specified range. Within that range, your vision pierces through the following: - **Darkness.** You can see in normal and magical [darkness-xphb (variant-rules)]]. - **Invisibility.** You see creatures and objects that have the [[conditions#Invisible|Invisible condition. - **Visual Illusions.** Visual illusions appear transparent to you, and you automatically succeed on [Death Saving Throw Xphb]] against them. - **Transformations.** You discern the true form of any creature or object you see that has been transformed by magic. - **Ethereal Plane.** You see into the Ethereal Plane. ## Player-Facing Summary Senses is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of senses as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around senses. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Hidden Prophecy of Depths ## Plot Hooks - A stranger needs help stealing before the new moon
