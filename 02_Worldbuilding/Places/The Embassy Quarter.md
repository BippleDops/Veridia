## DM Notes
The Embassy Quarter provides a hub for political intrigue and international plots. It's where global consequences of the crystal corruption become apparent through diplomatic maneuvering. The location offers opportunities for social encounters, espionage missions, and navigating complex political situations. The various embassies can introduce elements from distant lands without requiring travel, and the diplomatic immunity creates interesting challenges for law enforcement scenarios. The Quarter's connection to multiple plot threads makes it ideal for gathering information and launching international adventures.
