## Description
Mead, a delicate, slightly sweet wine made from honey, is slow to ferment and in scarce supply compared to grape [[Wines|wines]] or those of other fruits. Mead-making is an art, and the vintner must be careful to neither over-yeast his mead, making for a foul taste, nor allow it to grow too hot or cold, killing the yeast and forestalling proper fermentation. The mead offered here is the finest found in the Northlands, as the honey comes from the fantastic honey bees that inhabit the gardens in Neverwinter. Hand keg, 25 sp; cask, 6 gp; barrel, 20 gp; butt, 48 gp.
