## Overview
Archdruid Thornweaver has protected [[The Verdant Reach|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Verdant Reach]] for three centuries, watching the forest struggle against crystal expansion. Leading the [[The Verdant Accord|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Verdant Accord]], she represents the natural world's resistance to crystalline corruption. Ancient, wise, and increasingly desperate, she may be the last hope for preserving the pre-Shattering world.

### During the Crystallization
> [!warning] DM Only - Her Secret Memory
> She saw one of the Seven Betrayersâ€”the original Thornweaver, her ancestorâ€”participate in the Crown's breaking. She hides this shame and has spent centuries trying to atone.

## Secret Knowledge
> [!warning] DM Only
> - Knows location of the Green Shard (Southern Spire)
> - Her ancestor was one of the Seven Betrayers
> - Has been in contact with [[The Crimson Sage|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]]
> - The forest itself is becoming sentient from crystal exposure
> - Plans to awaken the World-Tree to fight crystals
> - Knows the true cure for corruption (requires massive life sacrifice)

## The Great Withering
> [!warning] DM Only - Ultimate Plan
> If all else fails, she can trigger the Great Witheringâ€”killing all plant life on the continent to starve out the crystals. This would doom millions but might save the world.

## Speaking Style
*"I have watched this forest for three centuries. I will not see it die in the fourth."*

*"You humans measure time in years. I measure it in trees. And too many have fallen."*

*"The crystals are not evolutionâ€”they are infection. And infections must be purged."*

## The Sacred Grove
Her seat of power, containing:
- The Heart Tree (500 years old)
- Pool of Pure Water (uncorrupted)
- Circle of Standing Stones (pre-Shattering)
- Hidden entrance to root tunnels
- The Green Shard (secret)
