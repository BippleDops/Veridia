*Wondrous item, common* This copper amulet contains tiny interlocking gears and is powered by magic from Mechanus, a plane of clockwork predictability. Faint ticking and whirring noises emanate from within. When you make an attack roll while wearing the amulet, you can forgo rolling the`d20`to get a 10 on the die. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 245* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Clockwork amulet xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
