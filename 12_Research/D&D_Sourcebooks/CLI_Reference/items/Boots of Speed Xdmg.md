# Boots of Speed
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/boots-of-speed.webp#right)


While you wear these boots, you can take a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] to click the boots' heels together. If you do, the boots double your [[speed-xphb|Speed]], and any creature that makes an [[actions#Opportunity%20Attack|Opportunity Attack]] against you has [[disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.

When you've used the boots' property for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function for you until you finish a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]].
