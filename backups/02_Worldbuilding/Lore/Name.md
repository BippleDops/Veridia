# Name

![[04_Resources/Assets/Art/Lore/Name.png|Name Portrait]]

## Summary
Name describes a turning current in history where choices about memory, depth, and sovereignty reshaped travel, trade, and ritual.

## Historical Context
- Origin: Scribal disputes escalated into pressure-lock conflicts.
- Spread: Merchant routes adopted secret signs to bypass tariffs; songs encoded depth-keys.
- Present: Competing narratives justify new taxes, oaths, and contraband routes.

## What It Means at the Table
- Investigation: On a lead toward old tariffs, players can extract schedules that reduce travel risks for a session.
- Social: Reciting the chapel oath grants advantage on one Persuasion check if honored afterward.
- Exploration: Recognizing encoded waystones reduces the chance of getting lost by one step.

## Threads and Revelations
- Records implicate agents tied to [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Sunken Library of Thalassius.md|The Sunken Library of Thalassius]].
- A rite echoes the activation cadence needed for [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]].
- Testimony suggests [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn.md|Vex Shadowthorn]] financed a pivotal bribe.

## Player-Facing Summary

Name is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Name as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Name.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Name to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at Name to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to Name active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
