## Overview

The Temporal Harvest refers to both a mysterious phenomenon and a theoretical magical practice involving the manipulation and collection of temporal energy. [[reports describe events where time itself appears to be "harvested" or "gathered" like a crop, with practitioners somehow extracting temporal essence for unknown purposes.

This phenomenon has been observed sporadically throughout Aquabyssos's history, typically manifesting as areas where time flows differently, objects that age rapidly or slowly, and individuals who experience [Temporal Displacement]]. Recent increases in these occurrences have caught the attention of scholars, mages, and city officials who are concerned about the implications for the stability of local space-time.

The concept has evolved from isolated incidents into a subject of serious academic study, with researchers attempting to understand whether the Temporal Harvest represents a natural phenomenon, magical practice, or something far more dangerous.

### The Chrono Gardens Incident (15 years ago)

The first major documented Temporal Harvest occurred in what is now known as the Chrono Gardens district. Residents reported that certain areas of their neighborhood began experiencing time at different rates - some flowers bloomed and died in minutes while others remained frozen in perfect stasis for months. The effect lasted for three weeks before gradually normalizing.

### The Age Storms (8 years ago)

A series of temporal disturbances swept through the [[Merchant|[Merchant Quarter]], causing rapid aging and youth reversals among affected individuals. Some merchants aged decades in hours, while others reverted to childhood. Most effects reversed themselves within days, but some changes proved permanent.

### The Echo Market (3 years ago)

A portion of the main marketplace became temporally unstable, creating "time echoes" where the same events repeated multiple times simultaneously. Shoppers could observe the same transaction occurring at different temporal rates in overlapping timestreams.

### Academic Theories

**The Cultivation Theory**
Proposed by **Chronarch Vera Timeweaver**, this theory suggests that time can be deliberately cultivated and harvested like any other resource. According to this model, skilled practitioners create temporal "fields" where time accumulates like sediment, then extract concentrated temporal energy for various applications.

**The Parasite Theory**
Advanced by **Scholar Mordant Voidtouch**, this darker interpretation proposes that the Temporal Harvest represents feeding by extradimensional entities that consume time itself, leaving behind temporal distortions as [[Evidence of their predation.

**The Natural Phenomenon Theory**
Supported by **Natural Philosopher [Marina Currentflow]]**, this theory argues that the deep ocean environment creates unique conditions where time naturally accumulates and is periodically released, similar to how tidal pools collect and release water.

**The Artificial Origin Theory**
Defended by **Investigator Captain Thane Deepwatch**, this theory suggests that the Temporal Harvest is the result of experimental magic or ancient technology that has become self-sustaining and unpredictable.

### Magical Applications

If the Temporal Harvest can be controlled or predicted, potential applications include:

- **Accelerated Research**: Speeding up experimental processes and observations
- **Preservation**: Slowing time around valuable or fragile objects
- **Healing**: Reversing injuries and diseases by manipulating personal [[Timelines
- **Communication**: Sending messages across different temporal rates
- **Defense**: Creating temporal barriers that slow enemy actions

### The Temporal Studies Consortium

A collaborative effort between multiple institutions studying the Temporal Harvest phenomenon:

**Research Goals:**
- Predict when and where harvest events will occur
- Develop protective measures for affected areas
- Investigate potential beneficial applications
- Determine the underlying cause of the phenomenon

**Current Projects:**
- [map]]ping temporal distortion patterns throughout the city
- Monitoring individuals with chronic temporal displacement
- Developing instruments to measure temporal flow rates
- Creating theoretical models for temporal energy manipulation

### Field Investigations

**The Deep Time Expedition**
Led by **Explorer-Mage Chronos Deepdiver**, this team investigates whether the source of temporal disturbances lies in the deepest ocean trenches where conventional time measurement becomes unreliable.

**The Memory Archive Project**
Directed by **Archivist Vera Remembrance**, this [[Initiative collects testimonies from individuals affected by temporal harvest events to identify patterns and predict future occurrences.

**The Paradox Prevention Initiative**
Managed by **Logic-Keeper Marcus Causality**, this group works to prevent temporal paradoxes that could result from uncontrolled harvest activities.

## Connection to Current Events

Several factors suggest the Temporal Harvest may be connected to Aquabyssos's current political crisis:

- Temporal disturbances have increased in frequency since political tensions began rising
- Some faction leaders appear to age or remain youthful at unusual rates
- Intelligence reports suggest research into temporal magic by unknown parties
- Prophecies and divination magic have become increasingly unreliable, possibly due to temporal interference

## Adventure Hooks

1. **[The Harvest]] Moon**: A predictable temporal event is approaching, and various factions are positioning themselves to either exploit or prevent it.

2. **The Time Thieves**: Someone is deliberately stealing time from specific individuals, and [[The Party must identify the culprits before they claim more victims.

3. **The Paradox War**: Competing [Groups]] are using temporal manipulation to gain advantages in the political conflict, creating dangerous paradoxes that threaten reality itself.

4. **The Chronicle Crisis**: The party discovers that their own actions in a previous adventure created a temporal disturbance, and they must decide whether to fix the timeline or accept the changes.
