--- ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Blinding Sickness

_Source: Player's Handbook p. 227_ Pain grips the creature's mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is [[conditions#Blinded|blinded]]. > [!note]

> This disease can be inflicted with the [[Contagion Xphb spell. ## Cackle Fever

_Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 61. Available in the SRD_ Cheaply made potions and elixirs are sometimes tainted by Cackle Fever, which affects Humanoids only (gnomes are strangely immune). A creature suffers the following effects`d4`days after infection: - **Fever.** The creature gains 1 [conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] level, which lasts until the contagion ends on the creature. - **Uncontrollable Laughter.** While the creature has the [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion condition, the creature makes a **DC 13** Constitution saving throw each time it takes damage other than Psychic damage. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (`d10`) Psychic damage and has the [conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] condition as it laughs uncontrollably. At the end of each of its turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically. **Fighting the Contagion.** At the end of each Long Rest, an infected creature makes a **DC 13** Constitution saving throw. After the creature succeeds on three of these saves, the contagion ends on it, and the creature is immune to Cackle Fever for 1 year. **Spreading the Contagion.** Any Humanoid (other than a gnome) that starts its turn within a 10-foot [[Area of Effect Xphb originating from a creature infected with Cackle Fever must succeed on a **DC 10** Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can't catch the contagion from that particular infected creature for the next 24 hours. ## Filth Fever A raging fever sweeps through the creature's body. The creature has disadvantage on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength. ## Flesh Rot The creature's flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage. ## Grackle-Lung

_Source: Out of the Abyss p. 54_ The constant smog in Gracklstugh causes grackle-lung in living, breathing creatures, resulting in persistent, wracking coughs and the spewing of thick, black phlegm. Whenever a living, breathing creature finishes a long rest in Gracklstugh, it must make a **DC 11** Constitution saving throw. On each failed save, the creature gains one level of [conditions#Exhaustion|exhaustion]] as its airways become increasingly clogged. A creature that reaches level 6 [[conditions#Exhaustion|exhaustion dies, as normal. A creature with one or more levels of [conditions#Exhaustion|exhaustion]] brought on by grackle-lung must succeed on a Constitution check to take the [[actions#Dash|Dash action. If the check fails, the action cannot be attempted. If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a verbal component, it must succeed on a Constitution check or be unable to complete the spell, causing the spell to fail with no effect. The DC for each check is 10 + the creature's current [conditions#Exhaustion|exhaustion]] level. If a creature's [[conditions#Exhaustion|exhaustion level drops below 1, it no longer suffers the effects of grackle-lung and becomes immune to it for the next week. Duergar and derro are inured to grackle-lung, making Constitution checks against it with advantage. Any spell or effect that cures disease also cures grackle-lung, effectively removing all levels of [conditions#Exhaustion|exhaustion]] brought on by the affliction. ## Mindfire The creature's mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects of the [[Confusion Xphb spell during combat. ## Seizure The creature is overcome with shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity. ## Sewer Plague Fouled potions and alchemical waste can give rise to Sewer Plague, which incubates in sewers and refuse heaps and is sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in such areas, including otyughs and rats. Any Humanoid that is wounded by a creature that carries the contagion or that comes into contact with contaminated filth or offal must succeed on a **DC 11** Constitution saving throw or become infected with Sewer Plague. A creature suffers the following effects`d4`days after infection: - **Fatigue.** The creature gains 1 [conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] level. - **Weakness.** While the creature has any Exhaustion levels, it regains only half the normal number of Hit Points from spending Hit Point Dice. - **Restlessness.** While the creature has any Exhaustion levels, finishing a Long Rest neither restores lost Hit Points nor reduces the creature's Exhaustion level. **Fighting the Contagion.** Daily at dawn, an infected creature makes a **DC 11** Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion level as its fatigue worsens. On a successful save, the creature's Exhaustion level decreases by 1. If the creature's Exhaustion level is reduced to 0, the contagion ends on the creature. ## Sight Rot Any Beast or Humanoid that drinks water tainted by Sight Rot must succeed on a **DC 15** Constitution saving throw or have the [conditions#Blinded|Blinded]] condition until the contagion ends. **Fighting the Contagion.** Magic such as a [[heal-xphb (spells) or [Lesser Restoration Xphb]] spell ends the contagion immediately. A character who is proficient with an [[Herbalism Kit Xphb can use it to create one dose of nonmagical ointment, which takes 1 hour. When applied to the eyes of a creature suffering from Sight Rot, the ointment suppresses the contagion on that creature for 24 hours. If the contagion is suppressed in this way for a total of 72 hours (requiring three doses and applications of the ointment), the contagion ends on the creature. **Spreading the Contagion.** Any Humanoid that makes skin contact with a creature infected with Sight Rot must succeed on a **DC 15** Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the contagion. On a successful save, the Humanoid can't catch the contagion from that particular infected creature for the next 24 hours. ## Slimy Doom The creature begins to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is [conditions#Stunned|stunned]] until the end of its next turn. ## Player-Facing Summary Diseases is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of diseases as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around diseases. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Accord - Manipulate succession ## Plot Hooks - A shipment has gone missing and truth emerges
