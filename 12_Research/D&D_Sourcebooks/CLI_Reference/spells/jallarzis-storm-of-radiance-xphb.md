# Jallarzi's Storm of Radiance
*5th-level, Evocation*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/jallarzis-storm-of-radiance.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of phosphorus)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You unleash a storm of flashing light and raging thunder in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [[cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb|Cylinder]] centered on a point you can see within range. While in this area, creatures have the [[conditions#Blinded|Blinded]] and [[conditions#Deafened|Deafened]] conditions, and they can't cast spells with a Verbal component.

When the storm appears, each creature in it makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `2d10` Radiant damage and `2d10` Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature also makes this save when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. A creature makes this save only once per turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The Radiant and Thunder damage increase by `d10` for each spell slot level above 5.

**Classes**: [[list-spells-classes-warlock|Warlock]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-evoker-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Wizard (Evoker)]]; [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]; [[list-spells-classes-wizard|Wizard]]
