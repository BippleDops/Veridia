## Description
This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains `dice: 1d4+1` (1d4+1) doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh Â½ pound.

As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that receives it regains `dice: 2d8+2` (2d8+2) hit points, ceases to be [[poisoned]], and is cured of any disease.
