3. **Action**: Players create choices using the system

- **Recovery**: How resources regenerate
- **Costs**: What actions consume resources #### Time Factor - **Action Economy**: How it fits in combat/exploration
- **Duration**: How long effects last
- **Frequency**: How often it can be used ## Detailed Rules ### Prerequisites Before using this mechanic:

- **Partial Success** (Fail by 5 or less): Limited success with complication
- **Failure** (Fail by 6+): Intended result not achieved
- **Critical Failure** (1 or fail by 10+): Significant negative consequence ### Modifiers & Advantages #### Circumstantial Modifiers - **Favorable conditions**: +2 to +5
