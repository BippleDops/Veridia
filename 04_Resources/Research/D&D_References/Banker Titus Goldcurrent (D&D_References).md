*The Pearl Counter, Master of Depths Fice, The Pressure Baron* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Titus Goldcurrent controls the largest ficial institution in [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], the **Deep Vault Banking Consortium**. From his coral-carved office in the ficial district, he orchestrates loans, investments, and currency exchanges that shape the economic fate of both realms. Behind his respectable facade lies a cunning manipulator who uses debt as a weapon and ficial leverage as chains, ensuring that anyone who needs capital eventually finds themselves dancing to his tune. ## Background

Born into a modest merchant family, Titus showed early aptitude for numbers and negotiation. He built his fortune through a combination of shrewd investments, strategic marriages (and strategic divorces), and carefully orchestrated ficial manipulation. His rise to power came during the **Crystal Currency Crisis** fifteen years ago, when he cornered the market on stable currency exchange and emerged as the most trusted ficial authority in both realms. ## Secrets

> - Artificially manipulates currency exchange rates for profit
> - Owns secret shares in most "competitor" banks, creating a monopoly
> - Has been embezzling from the Imperial Treasury for over a decade
> - Maintains detailed blackmail files on every major political figure
> - His "charitable donations" are actually bribes disguised as philanthropy
> - Plans to crash both realm economies to consolidate absolute ficial control
> - Has a hidden vault containing enough wealth to buy a small kingdom ## Motivations

1. **Primary**: Accumulate wealth and ficial control over both realms
2. **Secondary**: Establish a banking dynasty that will outlast him
3. **Hidden**: Create economic conditions that make him indispensable to rulers
4. **Personal**: Prove that money is the ultimate source of all power ## Business Holdings

2. **The Bank Heist** - Either rob Titus or help him stage a fake robbery for insurance
3. **The Corruption Investigation** - Uncover his illegal activities while avoiding his retaliation

5. **The Devil's Contract** - Magical contracts are trapping people; break the binding system

*"Money flows like water - it finds its way into every crack, every weakness, every need."* *"I don't deal in charity, my friend. Every pearl has its price, every favor its cost."* *"The beautiful thing about debt is that it never forgets, never forgives, and always comes due."* *"Politics? Religion? Love? All temporary. But compound interest? That's eternal."* ## Ficial Instruments

- **Depth Loans**: High-interest loans secured by property value
