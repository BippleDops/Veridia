## Special Traits
***Amphibious.*** The grung can breathe air and water.

***Poisonous Skin.*** Any creature that grapples the grung or otherwise comes into direct contact with the grung's skin must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature no longer in direct contact with the grung can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Standing Leap.*** The grung's long jump is up to 25 feet and its high jump is up to 15 feet, with or without a running start.

***Variant: Grung Poison.*** Grung poison loses its potency 1 minute after being removed from a grung. A similar breakdown occurs if the grung dies.

A creature poisoned by a grung can suffer an additional effect that varies depending on the grung's skin color. This effect lasts until the creature is no longer poisoned by the grung.

***Green.*** The poisoned creature can't move except to climb or make standing jumps. If the creature is flying, it can't take any actions or reactions unless it lands.

***Blue.*** The poisoned creature must shout loudly or otherwise make a loud noise at the start and end of its turn.

***Purple.*** The poisoned creature feels a desperate need to soak itself in liquid or mud. It can't take actions or move except to do so or to reach a body of liquid or mud.

***Orange.*** The poisoned creature is frightened of its allies.

***Gold.*** The poisoned creature is charmed and can speak Grung.
