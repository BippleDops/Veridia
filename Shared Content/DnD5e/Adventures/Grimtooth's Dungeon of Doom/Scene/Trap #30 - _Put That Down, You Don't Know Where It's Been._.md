# Trap #30 - "Put That Down, You Don't Know Where It's Been."
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> When the door is opened it will reveal a room 30 feet by 30 feet with a 15 foot high ceiling. The door is centered in one wall,and all the other walls arefearoreless,save for frescos on the stucco depicting a short stumpy wizard doing battle with a warrior wearing a bright crimson suit of armor. The wizard seems to be getting the worst of the battle. At various points the scenes depict a variety of magical attacks being defeated by the armored figure, who is pursuing the wizard determinedly.
> 
> The delvers will get a chance to inspect this wonderful armor first hand. There before the party, in the center of the room, arrayed on a frame manikin is the same suit Needless to say it reeks of magic at a level so high, and spells so over lain that it is hard to discern just exactly what they are intended to do.
> 
> If the party is wise they will give this armor a wide birth, but if they were wise they would not be traipsing about this deep delver shredding machine.
> 
> The armor seems to consist of crimson baked ceramic panels. Close inspection will show these panels to be made up of tightly packed fibers in a resinous matrix, baked into the various necessary forms for plate armor. The most unique aspect of this suit is that the helm is featureless. There are no eye openings at all. In all other respects this armor seems made to fit a nonnal human.
> 
> Don't fear; eventually someone will crack. Then either they will try it on, or some member of the party will be "volunteered" to try it on. Better still, not trusting each other various members of the party will try on various parts at the same time. What they will find is that the armor will confonn to who ever dons it, from the most petite female rogue to the most burly brute of a warrior. The second thing they will note is that the armor will not allow itself to be worn over other protection. If a delver attempts to put the armor on over another piece of armor, reguardless of its nature, the crimson armor will absorb the other piece and the original armor will no longer exist!
> 
> The party can test the armor to their hearts content Magical spells cast at the annor are either deflected off, in the,case of the more elemental powers, flame, wind, or energy blasts, or they are absorbed into the fabric of the armor in the case of more cerebral spells, like mind control, illusions, or death spells that attack the substance of ones being. It is proof against enchantment up to any level the party, in fact any party can generate. All in all it is a most remarkable suit!
> 
> In all the joy of finding a room where nothing is trying to kill them, and a treasure that is genuinely a treasure, the party may not notice that the frame manikin from which they extracted the suit is still radiating very powerful magic. This will require a direct detection of magic spell upon the frame manikin. The only spell remaining hereupon is one of restraint, at an unprecedented level. (Note the subtle hint!) The party will also note if a wizard tries to cast magic with the armor, or a piece of the armor on he finds that the armor works just as well from the inside as from the outside. In fact if the wizard is wearing the gauntlets and casts a flame spell he will be subject to the blast reflected back into the gauntlets and toasting his hands!
> 
> If all this seems too good to be true IT IS. The effect of the armor will begin once the wearer is outside the 30-foot range of the frame manikin. This armor is in fact proof against all magical attack. It was created to house the deamonic assassin sent by Selgolub in one of the earliest attempts to destroy Evinrood. This deamonic agent still exists, trapped by Evinrood within the fabric of the armor itself. The armor cannot act as an agent of destruction, not having the substance to move itself unaided. The imprisoned deamon trapped therein can and will take over the wearer and thus once again become the killing machine it once was.
> 
> If one member of the party is wearing the armor he will be destroyed by the deamon, and the armor-encased monster will attack the party with a vengeance. The magic defense capabilities are already known, as for the dearnons martial skills, he will have whatever weapons the character previously had and 5 times the physical attributes. The armor will take up to 20 points of physical damage per tum without material damage. Magical weapons are ineffective against it except as they represent the weapon type. (For example: The "Broadsword ofBurning" usually a `dice: 100D6` weapon, has the affect of an ordinary broadsword.)
> 
> The best fonn of chaos is if two or more members of the group are wearing parts of the armor. Then the deamon takes them all over. The thus-subjected members of the party then will attack all the unaffected party members. (The parts of the "deamonized" characters proteeted by the armor are defended as above, but there is no enhancement of attributes.) If the attackers are successful they will tum on each other until there is only one left who will don all the armor and stalk out of the dungeon seeking the shade ofEvinrood! If the remaining unaffected members of the party can render the affected members unconscious they can remove the armor and toss it back into the room, where th.e restraint spell holds the deamon contained, and the unconcious delvers will return to normal. (This trick only works with partial armor wearers, if the affected delver is wearing the whole suit, even if the armor is defeated he is dead.
> 
> While not a genuine trap in the mechanical sense this armored suit is better than fly paper where tomb robbers are concerned. Still it only rates three skulls. The whole setup is absolutely safe if the delvers just say, "No."
