--- # Meteor Swarm

*9th-level, Evocation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 1 miles
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points you can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius [[Area of Effect Xphb]] centered on each of those points makes a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes`20d6`Fire damage and`20d6`Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one fiery [[Area of Effect Xphb]] is affected only once. A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area, and the object starts [[burning-xphb (traps-hazards)]] if it's flammable. **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 298.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of meteor swarm xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around meteor swarm xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Strange accidents suggest a conspiracy
