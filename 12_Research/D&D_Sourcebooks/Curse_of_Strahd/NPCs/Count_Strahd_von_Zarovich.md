## Cordelia Integration
Originally from Barovia, Count Strahd has become entangled with the [[Shadow Conspiracy]] through his pursuit of immortality and power. His domain now exists as a convergence zone between realms, where shadow magic and crystal corruption merge.

## Background
Strahd discovered crystal technology during his vampiric existence and became obsessed with its power. Through shadow magic rituals, he bound his castle to a floating island that phases between Aquabyssos depths and Aethermoor heights.

## Plot Hooks
- Players discover Strahd's castle appearing near [[The Convergence Point]]
- Shadow operatives are recruiting using vampiric conversion
- Crystal-enhanced undead begin appearing in both realms
- Strahd seeks one of the [[Seven Shards]] for ultimate power
