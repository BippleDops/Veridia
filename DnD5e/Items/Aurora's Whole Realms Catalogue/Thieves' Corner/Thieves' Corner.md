# Thieves' Corner
## Overview
> [!warning] Message
> I like thieves. Rather a strange confession for a business owner, I realize, but I spent much of my adventuring life in the company of thievesâ€”and I enjoyed it. Thieves are not necessarily unethical, they just restrict their ethical conduct to a specific group of persons. Of course, though I sell thieving aids, I cannot condone thievery against any but those with ill-gotten goods. For all thieving equipment, I require payment in full prior to delivery of materials. Some of these items are unavailable at particular stations due to legality.
