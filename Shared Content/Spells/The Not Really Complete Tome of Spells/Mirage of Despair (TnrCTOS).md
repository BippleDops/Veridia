# Mirage of Despair (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *illusion*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V

**Duration**: 6 hours


## Effects
You affect one target in range that you can see. That target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, it sees everything around it in the worst possible light. Allies look hateful or even become monsters, a beautiful garden appears dying and covered in rot, a tranquil pool looks covered in slime and filled with dead fish.

The target becomes frightened of the most horrific-looking thing for the duration of the spell. If that object is removed from the targetâ€™s sight for more than ten minutes, the target will become frightened of something else. The target will also become increasingly paranoid during this time.

An ally of that target may attempt to talk the target out of the delusion, allowing that target to make one Intelligence saving throw to negate the spell.

This spell also can be dispelled through use of the *remove curse* or *dispel magic* spell.
