--- # Scroll of Protection (Monstrosities)

*Scroll, rare* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/scroll-of-protection.webp#right) Using a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to read the scroll creates a 5-foot [[Area of Effect Xphb]] originating from you. For 5 minutes, {{item.detail2}} can't enter or affect anything in the area. However, if you move in such a way that an Monstrosity would be inside the area, the effect ends. As a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, a creature within 5 feet of the [[Area of Effect Xphb]] can attempt to overcome it, which forces the creature to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the creature ceases to be affected by the [[Area of Effect Xphb]]. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 302* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Scroll of protection monstrosities xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
