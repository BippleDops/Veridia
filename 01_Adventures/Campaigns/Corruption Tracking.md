--- # Corruption Tracking *"Mark well the taint's advance, for what corrupts unseen destroys all."* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Corruption Tracking is the systematic monitoring and documentation of supernatural contamination affecting individuals, locations, and objects across both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. This system tracks the accumulation, progression, and mitigation of various forms of corruption including dimensional taint, eldritch influence, and magical contamination that threaten the stability of both realms. ### Duration

Ongoing campaign system requiring constant monitoring. ## Adventure Hooks

1. Furthermore, **Corruption Outbreak**: Rapid spread requires immediate response
2. **Hidden Source**: Investigation to find corruption origin
3. **Purification Mission**: Cleanse major corruption site ## Campaign Use

Provides mechanical framework for corruption as ongoing threat and character development element. ## Player-Facing Summary Corruption Tracking is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Corruption Tracking as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Corruption Tracking. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is blackmailing a artifact for love
