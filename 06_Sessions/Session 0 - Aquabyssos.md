## Overview
Session 0 for an Aquabyssos campaign establishes the unique parameters of underwater adventuring, the complex political landscape of the dual-world setting, and the specific character considerations required for thriving in this aquatic realm. This foundational session covers everything from basic survival mechanics to the intricate social hierarchies that define daily life in the great underwater city. Players must understand both the opportunities and dangers of their chosen setting before their characters take their first breath of enchanted water.

The session encompasses character creation guidelines, world orientation, campaign theme establishment, and safety tool implementation specific to underwater and pressure-related scenarios. Special attention is given to helping players understand how traditional adventuring concepts translate to the three-dimensional, multi-species society of Aquabyssos.

### Origins
The need for specialized Session 0 procedures developed as Aquabyssos campaigns grew in complexity and uniqueness compared to traditional surface-based adventures. Early campaigns often struggled when players arrived unprepared for the unique challenges of underwater society, leading to character concepts that couldn't function effectively in the setting or misunderstandings about basic survival requirements.

The multi-world nature of the setting, with its connections to Aethermoor and the constant presence of political tensions, required more comprehensive preparation than typical fantasy campaigns.

### Development
As the setting expanded and incorporated more detailed mechanics for pressure adaptation, crystal corruption, and inter-species politics, Session 0 procedures evolved to address these complexities. The development of standardized orientation materials and character creation guidelines helped ensure consistent campaign experiences across different groups.

The integration of safety tools became particularly important as the setting's themes of pressure, isolation, and corruption created unique potential discomforts for some players.

### Current Era
Modern Session 0 procedures for Aquabyssos campaigns represent a comprehensive approach to campaign preparation, incorporating lessons learned from numerous successful campaigns. Current procedures emphasize collaborative world-building, clear expectation setting, and thorough preparation for the setting's unique challenges and opportunities.

### In Aquabyssos
The concept of "preparation before the dive" is deeply embedded in Aquabyssos culture, making the Session 0 process particularly relevant to the setting's themes. Citizens of Aquabyssos understand that proper preparation prevents disaster, whether diving to new depths or embarking on new endeavors.

The collaborative aspects of Session 0 mirror the community-focused nature of underwater society, where individual actions affect the entire community's safety and prosperity.

### In Aethermoor
Surface dwellers initially found the extensive preparation requirements excessive, but have come to appreciate the thoroughness as they understand the genuine dangers and complexities of underwater life. Many Surface communities have adopted similar preparation practices for their own challenging endeavors.

### The Great Character Revision
An early campaign where inadequate Session 0 preparation led to multiple character concepts that couldn't function in the setting, requiring extensive mid-campaign adjustments.

### The Pressure Protocol Incident
A session where insufficient discussion of pressure-related content led to player discomfort, resulting in the development of enhanced safety protocols.

## Current Developments
Recent additions to Session 0 procedures include expanded sections on crystal corruption exposure, enhanced safety tools for pressure and isolation themes, and new collaborative world-building techniques that allow players to contribute to the setting's ongoing development.

The increasing popularity of mixed surface-underwater campaigns has led to additional procedures for handling characters with different environmental capabilities and cultural backgrounds.

## Adventure Hooks
1. Characters discover that their Session 0 backstory connections are more literal than expected
2. A mysterious figure claims to have been present during the characters' first meeting
3. Elements created during collaborative world-building begin manifesting in unexpected ways
4. The party's established relationships are tested by revelations about their chosen backgrounds

### Early Campaign
Session 0 elements provide foundation for early adventures, with established relationships and backgrounds driving initial plots and conflicts.

### Mid Campaign
Previously established character motivations and world elements become central to major story developments and character growth opportunities.

### Late Campaign
Session 0 choices reveal their full significance as characters face consequences and opportunities directly tied to their initial decisions and preparations.

### Running This Element
Treat Session 0 as collaborative world-building opportunity rather than just rule explanation. Encourage player investment in setting details and use their input to enhance campaign relevance and engagement.
