**Disease: [[Shabbisian Plague]]**
Victims of [[Shabbisian Plague]] begin experiencing symptoms `dice: 3d4` hours after being bitten by the carrier, whether it be a rat or some tiny insect such as a flea or mosquito. Its victims experience high fever and suffer teeth-rattling chills while at the same time their muscles spasm painfully and tendons tighten, causing limbs to draw up into an almost fetal position. In addition, the victim develops a purplish rash on cheeks, forehead, neck, armpits, and groin that eventually blisters and breaks open, causing oozing wounds that leave scars and can lead to further serious infections. Those that recover from the plague usually bear discolored scars from this rash as a memento, and frequently move with an uneven gait or have a slightly twisted arm caused by permanent tendon damage.

The victim’s Dexterity is reduced by `dice: 1d4` and Charisma is reduced by `dice: 1d2` when the symptoms kick in. The victim must make a successful DC 15 Con saving throw after completing each long rest or lose another `dice: 1d4` Dexterity and `dice: 1d2` Charisma. The disease ends if the character’s Con saving throw succeeds two days in a row.

After a victim recovers from [[Shabbisian Plague|Shabbisian plague]], the disease comes back `dice: 2d4` days later unless a successful DC 10 Con saving throw is made at that time. Subsequent bouts are identical to the first bout, except the DC for daily Con saves is 10. The disease always recurs `dice: 2d4` days after recovery until the initial DC 10 Con saving throw succeeds and staves it off permanently, or it’s cured with lesser restoration or comparable magic.

## Special Traits
**Wererage:** When a giant rat of Shabbis is reduced to half or fewer of its starting hit points, it immediately enters wererage (no action required) lasting 1 minute. The giant rat gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls, it gains resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons, and its Armor Class drops by 2. In addition, creatures damaged by the giant rat’s claw attacks must make a successful DC 13 Con saving throw or be infected by wererat lycanthropy.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The giant rat of Shabbis bites once and makes one claws attack.

**Melee Attack—Bite:** +6 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d8 + 4` piercing damage, and a creature must make a successful DC 13 Con saving throw or be infected with [[Shabbisian Plague|Shabbisian plague]] (see sidebox).

**Melee Attack—Claws:** +6 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 3d6 + 4` slashing damage. If the giant rat is in wererage, the target creature must also make a successful DC 13 Con saving throw or be infected by wererat lycanthropy.

## Description
**Environment**: Urban (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary

Fabled Shabbis-Beyond-The- Sea, the Green City of Jasper, is said to be the home of a thousand wonders and feared as the source of a thousand plagues. Shabbis, recognized by many yet known to few, is a port of distant Libynos, whose wharves lie among malarial swamps and whose ships ply the tepid coastal waters of the Boiling Sea. Shabbis provides a direct, unrestricted route to access the riches of the central lands of Libynos without interference by a major local power such as Khemit or Alcaldar, and has long proved a tempting destination for traders seeking to make a quick fortune on a risky venture. The fact that it is also known as a haven of unimaginable disease only adds to the allure of those adventure-seekers who would risk all at one roll of the dice. Because of its extremely remote location, few states of Akados have managed to successfully establish trade with this distant cornucopia, which is all well and good, because those few who do inevitably receive an unwanted visit by the hideous [[Shabbisian Plague]].

The equally fabled Giant Rat of Shabbis is, mercifully, a rare visitor to the city of Castorhage. Many argue whether there is a single Giant Rat that populates all of their tales or whether it is an entire species of gargantuan rats from that distant land. Though the latter is likely the truth, thankfully their appearance is rare to the point that there has never been more than one seen at a time. It is thought that if a true species, the giant rat must not be so large in its distant homeland or it would have long ago either decimated the human population or been hunted to extinction. Most proponents of the “rat species” theory assume that some quality of either a shipborne voyage to or taking up residence in western lands that somehow agrees with their foreign physiology causes them to thrive to the point that they grow to such prodigious size. Those more in the know whisper one word to account for their theory of unnatural growth: “Between ...”

Despite its size, a Giant Rat of Shabbis is able to squeeze into tiny spaces and is therefore found in the same sorts of places as other rats: sewers, disused subterranean structures and caverns, and in the holds and bilges of ships from where it swims to enter new ports. They are greatly feared as they are known to spread plague and the curse of lycanthropy, even though they are not lycanthropes themselves. This strange fact has led some scholars to speculate that the Giant Rat of Shabbis may be the original source of wererat lycanthropy. Whatever the case, those who succumb seem to become only hybrids of dire rats or [[Rat, Festering Lyme|festering Lyme rats]], and not of a Giant Rat of Shabbis itself.

[[Shabbisian Plague]] has long been a scourge of the city-states of the Boiling Sea so that most have enforced a trade embargo of the Libynosi nations against the Green City of Jasper. This is primarily enforced by the Kingdom of Khemit by land and the Empire of Alcaldar by sea. This has, in turn, resulted in even greater access to ships of Akados for the trade-hungry merchant lords of Shabbis who, as said traders, likewise risk the life and limb of all to enrich themselves and their houses.

The teeming swarms of rats and foul insects that infest the tidal swamps and dismal slums of Shabbis are known to be carriers of [[Shabbisian Plague]], but prove incredibly difficult to root out or eradicate from ships that make port in the Green City. The priesthood of the deity Bast conducts an ongoing, almost crusadelike, campaign against the folk of that city who travel abroad, and their multitude of feline minions have done more to stem the tide of plague in locations as far away as Bard’s Gate than any other measures ever taken. But even they at best can only keep the omnipresent threat of plague in Castorhage temporarily at bay, as it waits for just a moment of lassitude to unleash its foul effects upon the unsuspecting populace. For their part, the merchant lords of Shabbis see the waves of plague that sweep through the overflowing shanty towns within their city as a sort of urban renewal. What the royal family of Castorhage thinks of such events remains speculative at best, but it is unlikely to be far from a similar mindset.
