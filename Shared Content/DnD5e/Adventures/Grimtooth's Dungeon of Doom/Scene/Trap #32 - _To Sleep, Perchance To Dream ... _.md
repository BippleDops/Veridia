# Trap #32 - "To Sleep, Perchance To Dream ... "
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The party will be forced to backtrack through the armor room. From here they can either flee the dungeon, hopefully screaming in terror, or they can go over to the door that was on the left, as they originallô€ƒ˜ entered the armor room.
> 
> Once the typical 3 hole lock has been overcome, they will find themselves in a corridor 10 feet wide and 20 feet long and 15 feet in height. The door at the end of the corridor is truly different from most of the rest encountered so far.
> 
> It is set in the middle of a wall covered in green tiles. It is only 5 feet wide and 8 feet tall. It is made of red stone with the details of a great battle graven on its surface. There is an army of hundreds of warriors arrayed against one man standing upon a small hill. The single man resembles the depictions ofEvinrood that the gang of tomb robbers have seen before. The army is led by a huge figure on a horse drawn chariot. There is no magic on the door, and it has a common knoblike handle.
> 
> If any member of the party turns the knob there will be a loud bang, and the knob will explode in the hand of the person who turned it. If the character is not using a gauntlet the damage to the hand is considerable! (Barring magical intervention he will lose effective use of the hand.) If the delver in question is armored, and the armor is not magically impenetrable, he will find that while the explosion has not affected him, there are a number of small metal fragments that have penetrated his gauntlet. If the armor is magically impervious then the trap is wasted! (Curses, foiled again!)
> 
> If the character is wearing the non-magical gauntlet, he will likely start pulling the flechettes out of his paw. When he removes the last one he will begin to feel the effects of the herbal potion that was applied to the knob. (If the guy had no gauntlet at all, exsanguination will serve to flush the potion's affects right out of the system. Lucky him.)
> 
> The potion's effect is to cause the delver to fall into a deep narcotic sleep. This will last for 5 full game turns, despite all efforts to mitigate the result. During this time the delver will be subjected to wildly hallucinogenic dreams. These dreams will forecast the termination of members of the party in a variety of horrible fashions. The visions never show the traps themselves, only the end results: bodies covered with bugs, characters entombed in sand, or writhing on the floor of a room clutching at their throat. I'm sure you get the picture.
> 
> (Note: Take the player aside and tell him all this. It will sow the seeds of dissent, even if the player rushes back in and tells the whole truth. No one will be entirely sure he isn't holding out.)
> 
> After the knob explodes there will be revealed a panel under the remains of the lock trap. This panel wm have the familiar 3 bole lock mechanism. The door opens outward into the corridor. This trap set-up rates as at two skulls.
