The Leviathan Cult is a fanatical religious organization dedicated to awakening and serving the ancient sea monsters that slumber in the deepest ocean trenches. Led by **High Priest Dagon Deepcaller**, a half-human half-aboleth hybrid, they believe that the surface world must be cleansed and returned to the sea to appease their primordial masters. They operate from [[The Sunken Cathedral of Stars|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Sunken Cathedral Of Stars]], conducting dark rituals and breeding monstrous servants. ### Core Doctrines

1. The surface world is a corruption that must be cleansed
2. Humanity can evolve by merging with sea creatures
3. The Leviathan Lords will return to reclaim the oceans
4. Only through transformation can mortals survive the coming flood ### Project Deep Evolution

> [!warning] DM Only
> Creating perfect human-sea creature hybrids capable of surviving both on land and underwater. The ultimate goal is to replace all surface dwellers with these "perfected" beings. ### The Primordial Nursery

> Secret facility where juvenile leviathans are being raised and trained. These creatures will serve as the cult's ultimate weapons when they reach maturity. ### Mind-Slave Networks

> Using aboleth telepathy to create sleeper agents in major coastal cities. These agents appear normal but can be activated for coordinated attacks. ### Investigation Missions

1. **Missing Fishermen**: Entire coastal village disappeared overnight
2. **Corrupted Waters**: Local water supplies turning people into sea creatures
3. **The Singing Ships**: Vessels found drifting with crews transformed
4. **Underwater Ruins**: Ancient structures appearing in harbors ### Combat Encounters

5. **Cultist Raid**: Amphibious assault on coastal settlement
6. **Monster Hunt**: Track and destroy escaped breeding experiment
7. **Naval Battle**: Fight cult's hybrid sea monster fleet
8. **Underwater Infiltration**: Assault on breeding facility ### Social & Political

9. **Convert or Die**: Negotiate with cult leadership to save hostages
10. **The Corrupted Noble**: Expose aristocrat who joined the cult
11. **Religious War**: Mediate conflict between cult and surface religions
12. **The Hybrid Child**: Decide fate of half-human sea creature offspring ## Player-Facing Summary The Leviathan Cult is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Leviathan Cult as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Leviathan Cult. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Hidden Prophecy of Winds ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[High Priest Dagon Deepcaller
