Animated rugs of smothering might attack any creature that steps on them, or they might be passed off as superficially similar magic items, such as Carpets of Flying, and attack those who speak a supposed command word. Deadly tapestries, furs, and similar items also use this stat block.

## Animated Objects

*Mundane Objects Come to Life*

- **Habitat.** Urban  
- **Treasure.** None  

Magic can manipulate mundane items, compelling them to perform simple tasks. Such animate objects might be unassuming tools or decorations that can defend their creator. These objects follow simple instructions from whatever force or magic-user created them. If left unattended, they might defend an area for ages or repeat a task until they wear out.

Roll on or choose a result from the Animated Object Catalysts table to inspire what sort of magic motivates an ambulatory item.
