## Description
Snow leopards are relatives of the common leopard. They’re found in the coldest regions of the world, inhabiting mountain ranges, taiga, and snowy coniferous forests. Their lairs are typically rocky shelters lined with their own fur for warmth.

Snow leopards are strong, agile, nocturnal hunters. Their diet consists of livestock, wild boars, hares, and deer. Like most other big cats, they stalk and ambush their prey. Slain prey is dragged back to the lair and devoured over a period of several days.

Snow leopards are generally solitary, but a pair can be encountered during mating season. A den typically contains up to four cubs. Captured snow leopard cubs can be sold on the exotic-animal market for up to 500 gp.

A snow leopard is about five feet long, with light gray or smoky gray fur that turns to white on its underbelly. Its fur is marked with large rings that contain smaller and darker spots of dark gray or black. The fur is over an inch thick, providing the snow leopard with warmth against the extreme cold of its environment. Eyes are gray or dark blue. The cat’s paws are large and thickly furred, enabling it to maintain its footing on normally treacherous ice and to move quickly across deep snow.

Snow leopards are hunted by many races for their fur, which is both visually striking and warm.

Unlike other great cats, snow leopards do not roar. Their only vocalization is a low, soft moan.
