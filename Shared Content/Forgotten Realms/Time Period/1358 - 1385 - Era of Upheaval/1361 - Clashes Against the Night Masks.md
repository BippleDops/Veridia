# 1361 - Clashes Against the Night Masks
## Overview
**Date**: Friday, 2 January 1361 12:00:00 AM

Concerned about the threat that his son, Cadderly Bonaduce, posed to his plans, Aballister Bonaduce hired a band of [[Assassin|assassins]] of the Night Masks, a criminal organization based in the port city of Westgate, to murder him. Cadderly was currently in the [[G6 - Town|town]] of Carradoon, and while he and a group of his companions had a series of clashes against the [[Assassin|assassins]], the [[Priest|priest]]â€™s magical powers continually increased. Cadderly and his [[Friends|friends]] eventually killed all of the [[Assassin|assassins]], including their leader, [[Ghost]], who had wielded a vile magical device known as the Ghearufu, which had allowed him to swap spirits with others. Cadderly later used his magic to force the red dragon Fyrentennimarr to help him destroy the Ghearufu.
