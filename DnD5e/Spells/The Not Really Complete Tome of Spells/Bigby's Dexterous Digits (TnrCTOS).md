# Bigby's Dexterous Digits (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a pair of gloves stitched with your name and studded with gems worth at least 500 gp)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You create a pair of Tiny hands made of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccu-pied space that you can see within range.

The hands are objects that have AC 15 and 5 hit points. If all of the hands created by your spell are destroyed the spell ends. When you cast the spell and as a bonus ac-tion on your subsequent turns, you can move the hands up to 30 feet.

The hands perform various tasks for you, which you must decide upon when casting the spell.

***Fantastic Fencers.*** The hands are created holding long blades made of force. They at-tack using your spell attack modifier, and can attack two different targets at once. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage.

You may choose that the fencers do non-lethal damage instead, to use as a fencing partner. At the end of this version of the spell, all damage taken vanishes.

***Feeling Fingers.*** The hands have a Strength and Dexterity of 8 (-1) but otherwise functions of an *unseen servant.* It also has an amazingly sensitive sense of touch: it has Perception 14 (+2) and has advantage on all Perception checks, allowing it to detect mi-nute cracks and openings. You can choose to use your action to treat the hands as a sensor and feel through them.

***Pugnacious Pugilist.*** The hands are clenched and covered with bandages, as if they belong to a boxer. They attack using your spell attack modifier. On a hit, the tar-get takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage.

You may choose that the pugilists do nonlethal damage instead, to use as a boxing partner. At the end of this version of the spell, all damage taken vanishes.

***Silencing Hand.*** The hands fly towards a target you choose within range that you can see and clamp themselves tightly over the creature’s mouth, using your spell attack modifier to grapple the creature. While grappling a creature, the hands cannot be pulled away. The hands take only half the damage dealt to them and the creature grap-pled by the hands take the other half. While grappled, the creature is incapable of speak-ing and is at a disadvantage to all ranged attacks.

***Strangling Grip.*** The hands fly towards a Small or Medium-sized target you choose within range that you can see and grab onto its throat, using your spell attack modifier to attack. On a hit, it does 2d4 bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled (escape DC is your Spell Save DC). Until this grapple ends, the target can’t breathe.
