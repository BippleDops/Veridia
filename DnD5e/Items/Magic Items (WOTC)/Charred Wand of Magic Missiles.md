# Charred Wand of Magic Missiles

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Wand

**Rarity:** Uncommon

**Weight**: 4 lbs

## Description

This wand has 7 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the [[magic missile]] spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.

The wand regains `dice: 1d6+1` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a `dice: d20`. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

Each time you expend a charge from this wand, there is a **50 percent** `dice: d2` chance that nothing happens and the charge is wasted.
