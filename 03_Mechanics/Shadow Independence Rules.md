Legends speak of Shadow Independence Rules as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Shadow Independence Rules.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Shadow Independence Rules to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
