# Prophet Nerida Voidgazer

## Overview
Prophet Nerida Voidgazer leads the [[Church of the Tidal Throne]] from [[2-World/Places/The Sunken Cathedral of Stars]], preaching that [[The Great Drowning]] was divine judgment and that worse is coming. Her eyes are pools of black water that reflect no light, supposedly allowing her to see across all depths simultaneously. She speaks in multiple voices - sometimes her own, sometimes echoing things from [[2-World/Places/The Whispering Depths]], sometimes in tongues that predate human language.

## Personality
- **Prophetic**: Speaks primarily in visions and metaphors
- **Unsettling**: Presence causes unease even in believers
- **Compassionate**: Genuinely wants to save souls
- **Mad**: Cannot distinguish between realities anymore
- **Terrifying**: Her sermons can cause mass hysteria

## Abilities
- Sees past, present, and future simultaneously
- Can breathe any substance - water, air, void
- Divine magic twisted by deep influences
- Immune to madness (because already mad)
- Voice carries across impossible distances underwater
- Can show others visions by touch

## History
Was a young priestess when the drowning began. Tried to hold back the waters with prayer and was swept into [[2-World/Places/The Cerulean Trench]]. Emerged three days later, changed.
