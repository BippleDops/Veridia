# Healing Spirit
*2nd-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You call forth a nature spirit to soothe the wounded. The intangible spirit appears in a space that is a 5-foot cube you can see within range. The spirit looks like a transparent beast or fey (your choice).

Until the spell ends, whenever you or a creature you can see moves into the spirit's space for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, you can cause the spirit to restore `d6` hit points to that creature (no action required). The spirit can't heal constructs or undead. The spirit can heal a number of times equal to 1 + your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of twice). After healing that number of times, the spirit disappears.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the spirit up to 30 feet to a space you can see.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by `d6` for each slot level above 2nd.

**Classes**: [[list-spells-classes-druid|Druid]]; [[list-spells-classes-ranger|Ranger]]; [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Bard (College of Lore)]]
