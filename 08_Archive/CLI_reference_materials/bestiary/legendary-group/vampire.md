# Vampire

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual_

The region surrounding a vampire's lair is warped by the creature's unnatural presence, creating any of the following effects:

- There's a noticeable increase in the populations of bats, rats, and wolves in the region.  
- Plants within 500 feet of the lair wither, and their stems and branches become twisted and thorny.  
- Shadows cast within 500 feet of the lair seem abnormally gaunt and sometimes move as though alive.  
- A creeping fog clings to the ground within 500 feet of the vampire's lair. The fog occasionally takes eerie forms, such as grasping claws and writhing serpents.  

If the vampire is destroyed, these effects end after `2d6` days.

## Player-Facing Summary

Vampire is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of vampire as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around vampire.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties vampire to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at vampire to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to vampire active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
