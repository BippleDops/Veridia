# D-L-01 Leviathan Waking

## Read-Aloud
> The seafloor moves. A mountain exhales. Far above, the city-lights tremble like constellations shaken in a jar.

## Setup
- Zone: Abyss/Hadal • Category: Mythic Creature/Event
- Stakes: City-scale shockwaves; eco upheaval; political cascade

## Mechanics
- Command DC 18 coordinate allied vessels
- Helm DC 18 maintain distance; avoid wake
- Anchorite DC 17 soothe hymn to lull
- Optional: Diplomacy DC 17 to keep factions from firing

## Outcomes
- Success: Leviathan returns to sleep; global rumor; faction standings shift (+1 with eco factions; -1 with hawks)
- Partial: Coastal damage in one region; moral choice (aid vs. protect assets)
- Fail: Awakening; shockwave 4d6 per segment; arc “Age of Leviathans” opens

## Integrations
- [[Ecosystem Simulation Engine]]: migration and eco ripples
- [[Complete Faction Warfare System]]: doctrine reactions
- [[Sanity System]]: awe tests at GM discretion

## Scaling
- With anchors: treat DCs -1 if Reality Integrity > 75; +1 if < 50

## Variants
- Leviathan is wounded; hunt threatens; ethics foregrounded
- Song requires specific choir ship (quest)

## Quick-Run
- Call Command→Helm→Anchorite; adjudicate faction fire; apply global consequence
