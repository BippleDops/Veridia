# Trap #47 - "Oh No, Not The Old Chutes And Razors Gag!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> Lest you think old Grimtooth has lost his marbles, I am aware that we missed something back at [[Trap #39 - _Make Mine Very Dry ... _|Trap #39]]. There is another way out of the room housing the acid fountain. It lies to the left of the "racing stairs" and directly across from the hall entrance leading from the desiccation store room. As usual it lies beneath the stucco. It is the usual three finger hole lock type entry.
> 
> Once the door has been opened the tomb robbers will see a long flight of stairs leading down. In the distance at the limit of the torch light is the glint of bronze.
> 
> What follows is a trap so old and hackneyed I for one am almost embarrassed to see it used, but perhaps this tomb was constructed so long ago that it was some what fresher then. (Right, either that or Evinrood had dinosaur design consultants on this one.)
> 
> As the party pushes on down the stairs to a point about 25 feet down they will encounter three steps in succession that set off the trap. And as if we did not all expect this, the stair turns into a chute, in the ages old tradition of slapstick horror. Down the party will slide to some unspeakable peril. You guessed it. At a point on the chute 35 to 45 feet down from the top, 6 inch long sharpened blades, shark's tooth in shape project 6 inches into the party's path from wall to wall, one to a foot in a staggered pattern.
> 
> There is a fair chance that the delvers will fall for this if distracted, but even the most naive young delver should recognize the potential in a decending stair. If, however, the delvers are foolish enough to trip the trap, there is a 30% chance (L3) they will sustain damage of some major sort to what ever portion of their body is pointed at the bottom of the chute.
> 
> I'll only dignify this one with two skulls, old saws like this one give trapmasters a bad name, but they work so well ...
