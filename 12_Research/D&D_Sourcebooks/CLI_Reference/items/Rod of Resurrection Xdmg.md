# Rod of Resurrection
*Rod, legendary (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/rod-of-resurrection.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

The rod has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can cast one of the following spells from it: [[heal-xphb (spells)]] (expends 1 charge) or [[True Resurrection Xphb]] (expends 5 charges).

The rod regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll `d20`. On a 1, the rod disappears in a harmless burst of radiance.
