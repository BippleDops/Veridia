*Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 94* - **Alignment**: Unaligned
- **Pantheon**: Yuan-ti In the last years before the yuan-ti empire collapsed, Sseth appeared to the serpent folk in the form of a winged yuan-ti. He promised to lead the yuan-ti away from the brink of defeat and back to the pinnacle of world domination in return for their veneration. Many of Merrshaulk's devout turned to the worship of the Sibilant Death, believing him to be an avatar of their deity. They granted him enough power to mount a brief recovery, but those actions were too little and too late to prevent the collapse of the empire. Sseth chose to rest and gather strength during the years of decline, as more and more of the yuan-ti adopted his worship. His most devout followers, known as mind whisperers, use their god-given magic to emulate Sseth's tactics and principles. They strive to succeed by offering an alternative choice to contesting viewpoints or plans, and in so doing they exude an air of self-importance that gives them a less than savory reputation among yuan-ti that follow other gods. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Yuan ti sseth vgm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
