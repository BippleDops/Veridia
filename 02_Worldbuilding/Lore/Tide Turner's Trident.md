# Tide Turner's Trident

## The Legendary Weapon

The **Tide Turner's Trident** is perhaps the most powerful oceanic artifact in existence, capable of commanding the very currents of reality between [[Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos]]. Forged in the earliest days of underwater civilization, it represents absolute authority over all things aquatic - but its power comes with a curse that has destroyed every wielder who sought to master it completely.

### Physical Description

The trident stands seven feet in length, crafted from what appears to be crystallized deep-sea pressure. Its three tines shift between states of matter - sometimes solid coral, sometimes flowing water, sometimes crackling energy that resembles compressed lightning. The weapon weighs nothing in water but becomes impossibly heavy on dry land, making it nearly unusable by surface dwellers.

Ancient engravings spiral along its length, written in pre-submersion languages that shift and change based on the reader's knowledge. The base is wrapped in what scholars believe to be kraken leather, though the creature that provided it would have been impossibly large.

## Origin Legends

### The First Tide
*The creation myth most accepted by Aquabyssos scholars*

When the first waters of the world settled into their eternal depths, they wept for their separation from the sky. The tears of the deep crystallized into the trident's core, while lightning from the storm-touched surface provided its prongs. The weapon was gifted to the first [[Tide Turner]] as compensation for accepting the burden of mediating between the heights and depths.

### The Drowned God's Gift
*From the forbidden texts of deep-current mystics*

[[The Drowned God]] (in its ancient, benevolent aspect) created the trident to allow mortals to survive the great submergence that would create the underwater kingdoms. However, the weapon absorbed so much divine essence during its forging that it began to influence its wielders, slowly transforming them into extensions of the god's will.

### The Deep Mother's Trap
*Whispered by void-touched scholars*

The trident was never created by benevolent forces. It is a lure crafted by the [[Deep Mother]] to identify individuals with sufficient will and power to serve as vessels for cosmic influence. Each "heroic" deed performed with the weapon actually advances the plans of entities from beyond normal reality.

## Historical Custodians

### The First Dynasty (Ancient Aquabyssos)
The original **Emperor Oceanus** wielded the trident to establish the first underwater kingdoms. His reign lasted 400 years, but ended when he became so merged with the weapon that he transformed into a living current, his consciousness flowing through all the world's waters until it dispersed entirely.

### The Sage-Warrior **Thalassa the Deep-Touched**
Found the trident in Emperor Oceanus's sunken palace and used it to repel an invasion from surface-dwellers attempting to drain the oceans. She successfully defended Aquabyssos for three decades before the weapon's influence drove her to attempt merging all the world's waters into a single, eternal tide.

### The Current Keeper (Unknown)
The trident's current location is a closely guarded secret of the [[Tidal Council]]. Rumors suggest it rests in a sealed vault beneath [[Abyssos Prime]], guarded by constructs that can only be bypassed by one whose bloodline traces back to previous wielders.

## Powers and Abilities

### Tidal Mastery
The wielder gains complete control over any body of water:
- **Current Command**: Redirect flows, create whirlpools, calm or summon storms
- **Pressure Authority**: Survive at any depth, crush enemies with water pressure
- **Wave Shaping**: Transform water into solid constructs or devastating tsunamis
- **Ocean Telepathy**: Communicate with all sea life, understand underwater languages

### Reality Currents
The weapon's most terrifying power involves manipulating the "currents" between worlds:
- **Dimensional Rifts**: Tear holes between Aethermoor and Aquabyssos temporarily
- **Tide Portals**: Transport instantly between any two bodies of water
- **Memory Floods**: Access the accumulated knowledge of all previous wielders
- **Convergence Sight**: Perceive how actions in one world affect the other

### The Growing Price
Each use of the trident's power demands greater sacrifice:
- **Initial Wielding**: Slow transformation of lungs to gills, gradual water dependency
- **Heavy Use**: Personality begins merging with previous wielders, individual identity eroding
- **Ultimate Power**: Complete dissolution of self into the collective consciousness of all Tide Turners throughout history

## Multiple Perspectives

### The Religious View
*Temple scholars and spiritual leaders*

The trident is a test of spiritual worthiness. Those who wield it with pure intentions and accept its ultimate cost are transformed into guardian spirits of the ocean. The "dissolution" of previous wielders isn't death but transcendence.

### The Academic Assessment
*Researchers and archaeologists*

The weapon is an incredibly advanced technological artifact from a pre-convergence civilization. Its "mystical" properties are actually sophisticated applications of physics and dimensional manipulation.

### The Mystic Warning
*Void-touched seers and cosmic horror scholars*

The trident is a beacon for extra-dimensional entities. Each time it's used, it sends signals across reality that attract the attention of beings like the [[Deep Mother]].

## Current Status

### Signs of Awakening
Recent events suggest the trident is becoming active despite its supposed containment:
- Unexpected tidal phenomena in both worlds that follow artificial patterns
- Dreams shared by individuals across both worlds featuring the same underwater palace
- Ancient bloodlines experiencing "calling" sensations toward the deep ocean

### The Convergence Factor
As barriers between worlds weaken, the trident's power grows more accessible but also more dangerous. Some theories suggest that during full convergence, the weapon will automatically activate, seeking a wielder strong enough to either complete the merger of worlds or prevent it entirely.

## Mechanical Effects

**Tide Turner's Legacy** (Bloodline Trait)
Characters descended from previous wielders gain:
- Natural swimming speed equal to land speed
- Ability to hold breath for 1 hour per Constitution point
- Resistance to pressure and cold damage
- Compulsive attraction to the trident's location

**Trident Wielding** (Legendary Artifact Use)
If a character somehow gains access to the weapon:
- **Initial Bonding**: Gain all Tide Turner abilities but begin slow transformation
- **Power Scaling**: Each major use grants additional abilities but accelerates merger with previous wielders
- **Ultimate Choice**: Final wielding grants godlike power over both worlds but completely erases individual consciousness

## Plot Hooks

### The Bloodline Awakening
Multiple descendants of previous wielders are experiencing the calling simultaneously. Are they meant to work together, or is this the prelude to a battle between potential inheritors?

### The Broken Trident Theory
Evidence suggests the weapon was indeed shattered, with pieces hidden in both worlds. What happens if someone starts collecting the fragments?

### The False Trident
Someone has created a convincing replica and is using it to manipulate both governments. How long before the deception is discovered?

### The Ultimate Convergence
The trident is the key to preventing the catastrophic merger of both worlds - but using it requires a willing sacrifice who will accept complete dissolution of self.

*"Power over the currents means becoming the current. Choose your depths wisely."* - Final inscription on Emperor Oceanus's tomb

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
