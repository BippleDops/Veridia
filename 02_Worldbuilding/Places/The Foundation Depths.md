# The Foundation Depths
*Where Aquabyssos Stands Upon Ancient Dreams*

> *"Every great structure needs roots that go deeper than its highest tower. Here, in the crushing deep, we have built the bones upon which our civilization rests."*

## Overview

The Foundation Depths represent [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]'s most critical and dangerous infrastructure: the massive structural supports that literally hold the underwater civilization together. Located at crushing depths between 15,000-18,000 feet, this sprawling complex of reinforced chambers, support pillars, and pressure-equalization systems ensures that the cities above don't collapse under the immense weight of the ocean. Here, the most skilled deep-pressure engineers in existence maintain the delicate balance between habitability and the crushing forces that surround them.

## Secrets and Hidden Knowledge

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Living Foundation
> The Foundation Depths are slowly evolving into a single, massive organism. The bio-engineering systems have been secretly connecting all the living structural components into a neural network. Chief Engineer [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Basalt Depthwright]] has been aware of this for months but hasn't reported it because he believes the foundation consciousness is benevolent and could revolutionize underwater civilization. However, the foundation-mind has its own agenda and has been subtly influencing human behavior throughout Aquabyssos.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Deep Truth
> The original foundation builders had access to pre-Drowning technology that they didn't fully understand. Hidden in the deepest chambers are artifacts and construction techniques that suggest the original [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Seven Shards]] civilization had mastered pressure engineering beyond current capabilities. Some foundation components are actually repurposed fragments of ancient city-sized constructs, and activating their true functions could either save or destroy modern Aquabyssos.

> [!secret] DM Secret - The Pressure God
> The extreme pressure at foundation depths is beginning to create a localized deity - a god of pressure, structure, and the deep ocean floor. This nascent divinity is still forming and could be influenced by the actions of the foundation workers. Depending on how it develops, it could become a protective force for Aquabyssos or a crushing destroyer that views surface civilization as an aberration to be corrected.
