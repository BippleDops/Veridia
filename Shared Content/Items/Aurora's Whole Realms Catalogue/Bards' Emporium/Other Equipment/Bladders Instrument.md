## Description
What child is happier than one with a full bladder? These pig bladders can be blown up to the size of a manâ€™s head. (As anyone knows, bladders vary in size.) They can be attached to a stick or [[String|string]], filled with water and thrown, released to sputter about the room, or even punctured to produce a loud pop.
