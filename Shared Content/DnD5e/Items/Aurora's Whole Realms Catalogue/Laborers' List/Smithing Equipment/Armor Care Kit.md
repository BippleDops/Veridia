## Description
For orcish warriors, battle-scarred armor symbolizes war prowess. Less barbaric warriors, though, realize the destructive effects of rust and wear on armor. For them, we provide an armor-polishing kit: a 9 oz jar of armor cleaner, a stiff cleaning brush, a 9 oz jar of armor polish, and a soft buffing brush. The whole kit weighs only a pound and a half and takes little room in a [[Rucksack|rucksack]]. (7 gp)

## Additional Details
required for all plate armor to prevent lost of 1 AC level per 6 months
