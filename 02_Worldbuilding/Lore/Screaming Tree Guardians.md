# Screaming Tree Guardians

*"Their cries echo through wood and water, warning all who would harm the ancient groves."*

## Overview
Screaming Tree Guardians are sentient plant creatures that have evolved to protect underwater kelp forests and surface woodlands through the use of devastating sonic attacks. These guardians can produce ear-piercing shrieks that disorient enemies, call for help from other forest creatures, and even cause physical damage through focused sound waves.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
- Ancient forest or kelp grove to protect
- Magical connection to plant network
- Territory threatened by external forces
- Ability to produce and control sonic attacks

### Effects
- **Sonic Blast**: Devastating sound-based attacks
- **Forest Communication**: Alerts other guardians and creatures
- **Intruder Deterrent**: Frightens away potential threats
- **Area Denial**: Makes regions impassable through sustained noise

### Duration
Permanent guardians active indefinitely while forest remains healthy.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Guardian Negotiation**: Peaceful passage requires diplomatic approach
2. **Forest Defense**: Join guardians in protecting grove from destruction
3. **Silent Approach**: Infiltration mission requiring stealth to avoid detection

## Campaign Use
Provides environmental challenges and opportunities for characters to interact with nature-based protectors.
