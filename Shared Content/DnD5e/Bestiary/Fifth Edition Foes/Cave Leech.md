## Special Traits
**Blood Drain:** Immediately after making a constriction attack against a grappled creature, the cave leech can try to drag that creature to its mouth, where it bites the creature automatically and drains its blood, inflicting 4 (`dice: 1d8`) piercing damage. The target can resist being dragged with a Strength contest against the cave leech; the cave leech must win the contest to drag the character to its mouth. A character who wins this contest does not break the cave leech's grapple. The cave leech can try a Strength contest against every creature it makes a constriction attack against until it wins a Strength contest and drains one creature's blood. It can drain blood from the same creature or a different creature each round, but it must win a Strength contest each time.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The cave leech attacks eight times, in any combination of tentacle attacks and constriction attacks.

**Tentacle:** *Melee Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d6+4`) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled and restrained.

**Constriction:** *Melee Attack:* automatic hit, one creature grappled by a tentacle. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d6+4`) bludgeoning damage and the target can be dragged to the cave leech's mouth to be drained of blood (see above).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Underground

**Organization**: Solitary or pack (2–5)

## Description
Though not aquatic creatures, cave leeches are often found lairing near underground rivers, lakes, and streams. They are aggressive monsters whose sole purpose seems to be to kill and devour any living thing that stumbles into their territory. Cave leeches aren’t social animals, but they are seldom found alone. Food is not shared among them, so each leech is effectively on its own when hunting prey. When one catches something, however, others are likely to show up quickly. Quarrels often erupt over prey, with grappled victims being caught in the middle of a tug-of-war between two or more leeches, all trying to suck out their blood.

An adult cave leech grows about 8 feet long, and its whiplike tentacles are each about 6 feet long. Cave leeches are easily mistaken for ordinary giant leeches, especially when at rest, when the creatures fold their tentacles back against their bodies. They also do this when waiting to strike.

When a meal comes within range, the cave leech lashes out with a tentacle and grabs its target. Grabbed prey is pulled to the cave leech’s mouth and bitten by its horrible teeth. A victim that is completely drained of blood becomes a pale, shrunken husk. Leathery, mummifying carcasses of the leeches’ victims litter their hunting grounds or lairs, where victims are sometimes dragged to feed the leeches’ young.
