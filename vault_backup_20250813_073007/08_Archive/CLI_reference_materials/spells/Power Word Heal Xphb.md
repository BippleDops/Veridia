*9th-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes over one creature you can see within range. The target regains all its [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]]. If the creature has the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Charmed|Charmed]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Frightened|Frightened]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]], or [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Stunned|Stunned]] condition, the condition ends. If the creature has the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Prone|Prone]] condition, it can use its [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb|Reaction]] to stand up.

**Classes**: [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"|Sorcerer (Divine Soul)]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric|Cleric]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]
