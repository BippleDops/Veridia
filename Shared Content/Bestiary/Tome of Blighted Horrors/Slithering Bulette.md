Its back plate rises up between its shoulders into a finlike dorsal hump. Even stranger, however, the entire creature appears to be composed entirely of some transparent gelatinous substance that has difficulty holding its form.*

## Special Traits
**Amorphous:** A slithering bulette can move through gaps as small as 4 square feet without penalty.

**Engulf:** As an action, the slithering bulette moves up to its full speed. It can enter spaces occupied by Large or smaller creatures as it moves. If the creature whose space is being entered makes a successful DC 16 Dex saving throw, the creature moves safely out of the slithering bulette’s path. If the saving throw fails, the creature is engulfed: it takes `dice: 2d6` acid damage immediately, is restrained, can’t breathe, and takes `dice: 4d6` acid damage at the start of each of the slithering bulette’s turns. An engulfed creature can use an action on its turn to try to escape from the slithering bulette; the creature escapes if it makes a successful DC 15 Str check. A creature adjacent to the slithering bulette can use an action to try to pull one engulfed creature free. The rescue succeeds if the creature makes a successful DC 15 Str check, and the creature making the check takes `dice: 2d6` acid damage whether it succeeds or fails. A slithering bulette can engulf two Large creatures, four Medium creatures, or 16 Small creatures in any combination.

**Sealed Mind:** Even though a slithering bulette is intelligent, it’s immune to mind-affecting effects such as charms, domination, illusions, and phantasms.

**Transparent:** Because of its lack of coloration, a motionless slithering bulette can be spotted only with a successful DC 15 Wis (Perception) check. The creature is spotted automatically if it moves, attacks, or contains an engulfed creature. Creatures that blunder into an unseen slithering bulette are surprised.

## Actions
**Melee Attack—Bite:** +8 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 5d12 + 5` piercing damage, and a creature must make a successful DC 16 Con saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A paralyzed creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect with a success.

## Description
**Environment**: Underground (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary

The slithering bulette is a great oddity among the work of the physicians in that while it appears to have the form of one creature — a bulette, to be precise — it is entirely composed of the oozelike proto-matter of the slithering tracker and the gelatinous cube. Somehow, the strange creature combines the most dangerous qualities of both creature types.

The creature’s preferred attack is to overrun and engulf opponents into its body to drain their plasma and dissolve their matter. It then continues fighting with its ferocious bite while any creature trapped within is carried along for the ride as it fights. The slithering bulette continues to favor this tactic as long as it is able and is generally too dumb to retreat from a battle. However, if it sustains more than 50 points of damage in a single attack, the dim intellect that drives it kicks in and it tries to retreat.

Though a slithering bulette retains the tremorsense of a bulette, it does not possess its burrowing ability. If it retreats, there is a 20% chance that a slithering bulette spends a full round unsuccessfully trying to burrow into whatever is under it. After a round of fruitless effort, the slithering bulette realizes its error and makes a run for it.

If an opponent escapes from a battle, leaving a slithering bulette victorious, the creature’s instinct to track takes over and for the next `dice: 1d4` days it attempts to follow the trail of the escaped opponent to finish the kill.
