# Bandit Leader Scarface

**Type:** Combat/Social/Revenge  
**Level:** 5-9  
**Location:** [[The Cerulean Trench]], [[Smuggler's Cove]], [[Port Meridian - Harbor District]]  
**Duration:** 2-3 sessions  
**Threat:** A brutal bandit leader is disrupting trade routes and has personal vendetta against surface dwellers

## Overview
"Scarface" Korvin Blacktide was once a respected [[Current Riders Guild]] captain until a surface trading expedition went horribly wrong, leaving him disfigured and his crew dead. Now he leads the [[Crimson Tide Pirates]], raiding merchant vessels and harboring deep hatred for anyone connected to [[Aethermoor]]. His latest raids have escalated from simple robbery to outright terrorism.

## Background
Three years ago, Captain Korvin Blacktide led a legitimate trading mission to the surface world. [[Goldspire Confederacy]] merchants betrayed the expedition, stealing their cargo and leaving the crew stranded in hostile waters. When [[Admiral Thorne Blackwater]] finally found them, only Korvin had survived - scarred by crystal corruption and driven mad by watching his friends die. Rather than seeking justice through proper channels, he turned to piracy.

## Key NPCs
- **Korvin "Scarface" Blacktide**: The bandit leader, brilliant tactician consumed by revenge
- **[[Current Riders Guild]] Master [[Guildmaster Harwick]]**: Former mentor seeking to bring Korvin home
- **[[Shadow Merchant Riptide]]**: Fence who provides Scarface with intelligence and equipment
- **Captain Marina Swiftcurrent**: Korvin's former lover, now leading efforts to stop him
- **Surface Trader Aldric Goldspire**: The merchant who betrayed Korvin's original expedition
- **[[Mediator Serenity Stillwater]]**: Diplomat attempting peaceful resolution

## The Scarface Problem

### Escalating Raids
Korvin's attacks have grown increasingly sophisticated and vicious:
- **Trade Route Disruption**: Systematic attacks on merchant vessels
- **Intelligence Network**: Spies in major ports providing target information
- **Recruitment Drive**: Attracting desperate criminals and disaffected citizens
- **Symbolic Terrorism**: Specifically targeting surface-affiliated businesses
- **Hostage Taking**: Capturing surface dwellers for ransom and psychological warfare

### His Criminal Organization: The Crimson Tide Pirates
- **Size**: 200+ active members across multiple vessels
- **Territory**: Controls several coves and underwater hideouts in [[The Cerulean Trench]]
- **Resources**: Fleet of modified vessels designed for hit-and-run tactics
- **Reputation**: Feared throughout [[Aquabyssos]] shipping lanes
- **Philosophy**: "The surface betrayed us, so we'll make them pay"

## Phase 1: Investigation (1 session)
**Location:** [[Port Meridian - Harbor District]]  
**Objective:** Learn about Scarface's methods and locate his base of operations

### Gathering Intelligence
**Sources of Information:**
- **Surviving Victims**: Merchants who escaped recent raids
- **[[Harbor Master Luna Freedrift]]**: Has detailed shipping records showing attack patterns
- **[[Dockworkers Union]]**: Members have heard rumors about recruitment efforts
- **[[Current Riders Guild]] Records**: Official files on Korvin's transformation
- **[[Shadow Market Canals]]**: Black market dealers selling stolen goods

**Key Discoveries:**
1. **Personal Motivation**: Attacks specifically target [[Goldspire Confederacy]] affiliates
2. **Tactical Patterns**: Raids follow predictable routes based on shipping schedules
3. **Inside Knowledge**: Someone is providing Scarface with classified trade information
4. **Base Location**: Multiple witnesses place his fleet in [[The Cerulean Trench]]
5. **Recent Escalation**: Plans to attack a major diplomatic convoy

### Investigation Challenges
- **Criminal Sympathy**: Some citizens view Scarface as fighting unjust surface exploitation
- **Witness Intimidation**: Fear of retaliation keeps potential informants quiet
- **Official Corruption**: Some harbor officials may be working with the pirates
- **Time Pressure**: Next major attack scheduled within days

## Phase 2: Confrontation Options (1-2 sessions)
**Location:** [[The Cerulean Trench]], [[Smuggler's Cove]]  
**Objective:** Stop Scarface through combat, negotiation, or cunning

### Option A: Direct Assault
**Location:** Scarface's hidden base in the trench  
**Challenge:** Full-scale battle against fortified pirate stronghold

**Tactical Considerations:**
- **Environmental Hazards**: Fighting in deep water with strong currents
- **Defensive Positions**: Pirates have home field advantage with prepared defenses
- **Collateral Damage**: Base contains civilian prisoners and stolen goods
- **Escape Routes**: Multiple underwater tunnels allow strategic withdrawal

### Option B: Diplomatic Resolution
**Location:** Neutral territory arranged by [[Mediator Serenity Stillwater]]  
**Challenge:** Convince Scarface to abandon piracy in exchange for justice

**Negotiation Points:**
- **Justice for Original Betrayal**: Prosecute [[Goldspire Confederacy]] merchants
- **Compensation**: Reparations for losses suffered by Korvin and families of dead crew
- **Amnesty Deal**: Reduced sentences for pirates willing to return to legitimate work
- **Surface Accountability**: Formal trade agreements with better protection for depth merchants

### Option C: Undercover Infiltration
**Location:** Pose as recruits or allies to get close to Scarface  
**Challenge:** Maintain cover while gathering intelligence and sabotaging operations

**Infiltration Goals:**
- **Rescue Hostages**: Free captured civilians without alerting the entire base
- **Sabotage Fleet**: Disable ships to prevent escape or future raids
- **Gather Evidence**: Collect proof of crimes for prosecution
- **Turn Allies**: Convince some pirates to abandon Scarface's cause

## Scarface's Master Plan

### The Diplomatic Convoy Raid
Korvin's ultimate goal is to attack a high-profile diplomatic convoy carrying:
- **Surface Ambassadors**: Representatives from multiple [[Aethermoor]] nations
- **Trade Treaties**: Documents establishing new economic partnerships
- **Symbolic Cargo**: Gifts and cultural artifacts for diplomatic exchange
- **Heavy Security**: Military escort that would make this Korvin's biggest challenge

**His Strategy:**
1. **Intelligence Gathering**: Inside sources provide exact route and timing
2. **Coordinated Attack**: Multiple vessels strike simultaneously at vulnerable chokepoint
3. **Hostage Leverage**: Capture diplomats to force surface nations into negotiations
4. **Public Spectacle**: Broadcast the attack to demonstrate surface vulnerability
5. **Political Demands**: Use captives to demand investigation of original betrayal

> [!danger] DM Secret
> Korvin's crystal corruption is slowly killing him - he has maybe six months to live. His desperate escalation isn't just about revenge; it's about accomplishing something meaningful before his death. This knowledge could completely change how the party approaches the situation, turning a villain into a tragic figure racing against time.
