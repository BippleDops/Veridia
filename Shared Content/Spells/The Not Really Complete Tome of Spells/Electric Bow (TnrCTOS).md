# Electric Bow (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (the tail feathers of a quail, tied together with a bowstring)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


## Effects
You create a bow or crossbow (your choice) made of shimmering, solid electricity, and 20 matching missiles. You are considered to have proficiency in using this weapon, if you did not already. If any creature other than you touches the bow, that crea-ture takes 1d4 lightning damage.

You can only fire the missiles created by the spell with this bow. These missiles, re-gardless of whether it is an arrow or a quar-rel, have a range of 120/500 and do 2d10 + your spell attack modifier in lightning dam-age.

The bow lasts for as long as you concentrate on it or until you run out of missiles.
