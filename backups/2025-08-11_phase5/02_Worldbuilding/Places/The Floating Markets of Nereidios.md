# The Floating Markets of Nereidios
*Where Ocean and Commerce Flow as One*

## Overview
The Floating Markets of Nereidios are a massive collection of interconnected ships, platforms, and artificial islands that form a mobile trading city on [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Azure Coast]]. This unique maritime marketplace serves as the primary hub for aquatic goods, deep-sea treasures, and cultural exchange between surface dwellers and underwater civilizations.

## Market Operations
The floating city operates on tidal schedules, with different merchant districts rotating based on ocean currents and seasonal patterns. Major trade includes pearl diving, exotic fish, underwater minerals, and cultural artifacts from [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Abyssos Prime]]. The markets face constant threats from [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Crimson Fleet]] raids and [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Leviathan Cult]] recruitment.
