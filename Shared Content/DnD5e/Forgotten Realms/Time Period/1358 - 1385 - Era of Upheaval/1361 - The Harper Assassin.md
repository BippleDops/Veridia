# 1361 - The Harper Assassin
## Overview
**Date**: Thursday, 1 January 1361 12:00:00 AM

The malicious sun elf weapons master Kymil Nimesin secretly gained control of the elfshadow ability of the moonblade, a hereditary magical sword, possessed by Arilyn Moonblade, a half-elven adventurer who often worked for the Harpers, a semi-secret organization dedicated to fighting for freedom and justice. Kymil used the elfshadow to murder several members of the Harpers as part of his plot to access a magical portal between the elven island of Evermeet and mainland Faerûn in order to kill the remaining members of the nation’s royal family. Arilyn and Danilo Thann, a Waterdhavian nobleman and [[Mage|mage]], eventually discovered the identity of the Harper [[Assassin]], thwarted Kymil’s plans, and defeated the elven warrior. Afterward, Arilyn and Danilo became official members of the Harpers.
