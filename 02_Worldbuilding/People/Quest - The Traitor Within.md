# Quest - The Traitor Within

**Level:** 6-9 | **Type:** Investigation/Political Intrigue | **Duration:** 4-6 sessions

## Overview
Sensitive military intelligence has been leaked to enemy forces, resulting in failed operations and lost lives. High Command suspects a traitor within their ranks and needs discrete investigators to uncover the spy's identity without alerting them or causing panic among the troops.

## Quest Giver
**General Marcus Ironward** - Veteran military commander torn between loyalty to his officers and duty to protect his soldiers. Offers 5,000 gp and military commendations for successfully identifying the traitor.

## Background
Recent military disasters suggest inside information reached enemy hands. Three separate operations failed despite careful planning, enemy forces appeared prepared for tactics, and classified supply routes were ambushed. The leak threatens ongoing war efforts and soldier morale.

## Primary Suspects
- **Colonel Elena Brightblade** - Ambitious officer with political connections
- **Captain Marcus Shadowstep** - Intelligence officer with access to all operations
- **Chaplain Vera Goldenheart** - Military priest counseling stressed officers
- **Supply Master Jonas Coppercount** - Logistics expert handling resource distribution
- **Aide-de-camp Theron Quickquill** - General's personal assistant with broad access

## Investigation Methods
**Surveillance:** Observe suspect activities and meetings
**Document Analysis:** Review correspondence and records
**Interrogation:** Question suspects without revealing investigation
**Infiltration:** Pose as military personnel or support staff
**Counter-intelligence:** Feed false information to identify leak source

## Clues and Evidence
**Financial Records:** Suspicious payments or unexplained wealth
**Communication Patterns:** Regular contact with unknown parties
**Behavioral Changes:** Stress, guilt, or unusual actions
**Access Logs:** Who had information before each failed operation
**Physical Evidence:** Hidden messages or coded communications

## Red Herrings
- Officer conducting legitimate but secret romance
- Soldier struggling with gambling debts
- Personnel suffering from combat stress
- Chaplain providing confidential spiritual guidance
- Supply issues caused by bureaucratic inefficiency

## The Truth
**Revealed Traitor:** Captain Marcus Shadowstep, blackmailed into cooperation after enemy agents discovered his desertion from previous conflict
**Motivation:** Protecting family members held hostage by enemy forces
**Methods:** Providing intelligence through coded supply requisitions
**Complications:** Not malicious traitor but desperate father

## Major Encounters
1. **Investigation Planning** (Social) - Gaining General's trust and access
2. **Covert Surveillance** (Stealth/Investigation) - Gathering evidence
3. **False Flag Operation** (Deception) - Testing suspects with false information
4. **Enemy Agent Contact** (Combat/Social CR 6) - Confronting handler
5. **Traitor Confrontation** (Social/Combat) - Final revelation scene

## Moral Complications
- Traitor acted under duress to protect family
- Revealing truth could destroy innocent man's life
- Military justice may be harsh regardless of motivation
- Enemy still holds traitor's family as leverage
- Failed operations caused real casualties

## Resolution Options
**Military Justice:** Turn traitor over for court martial
**Negotiated Surrender:** Arrange family rescue in exchange for cooperation
**Cover-up:** Hide truth and relocate traitor quietly
**Double Agent:** Convert traitor into asset against enemies
**Mercy:** Help traitor escape with family to neutral territory

## Consequences
**Justice Route:** Maintains military discipline but destroys family
**Rescue Route:** Dangerous operation but saves innocent lives
**Cover-up Route:** Protects individuals but compromises integrity
**Double Agent Route:** Continues risk but provides intelligence advantage
**Mercy Route:** Shows compassion but may set dangerous precedent

## Rewards
**Base:** 5,000 gp, military honors and connections
