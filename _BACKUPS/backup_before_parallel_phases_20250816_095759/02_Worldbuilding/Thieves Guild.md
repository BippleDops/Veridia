**Location**: Shadowhaven ## Description

**Details**: Rich sensory elements bring this to life.

The Thieves Guild is a powerful and influential criminal organization that operates in the shadows of Shadowhaven. They are involved in all manner of illegal activities, from petty theft to high-stakes heists. ## Player-Facing Summary Thieves Guild is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Thieves Guild as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Thieves Guild. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Strange disappearances suggest a curse
