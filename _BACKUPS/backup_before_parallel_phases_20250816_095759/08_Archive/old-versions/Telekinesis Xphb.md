--- # Telekinesis

*5th-level, Transmutation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought. When you cast the spell and as a [[actions#Magic|Magic action on your later turns before the spell ends, you can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after round or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer affected by the spell. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Creature You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or you move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell's range. Until the end of your next turn, the creature has the [conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition, and if you lift it into the air, it is suspended there. It falls at the end of your next turn unless you use this option on it again and it fails the save. ## Object You can try to move a Huge or smaller object. If the object isn't being worn or carried, you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell's range. If the object is worn or carried by a creature, that creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or you pull the object away and move it up to 30 feet in any direction within the spell's range. You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial. ## Summary **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 331. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* ## Player-Facing Summary Telekinesis xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of telekinesis xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around telekinesis xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[Master_Spell_Compendium]]
