# Quest - The Runaway Golem

**Level:** 4-6 | **Type:** Chase/Investigation | **Duration:** 2-3 sessions

## Overview
Artificer Master Elena Gearwright's prized creation, a sentient stone golem named "Faithful," has disappeared from her workshop. The construct was her life's work, designed with experimental consciousness magic. She fears it may be confused, dangerous, or stolen by rivals.

## Quest Giver
**Master Elena Gearwright** - Brilliant artificer specializing in construct consciousness. Offers 2,500 gp plus magical items for Faithful's safe return.

## Background
Faithful was Elena's attempt to create a truly sentient construct capable of independent thought and emotion. The experiment succeeded too well - the golem gained self-awareness and began questioning its purpose and freedom.

## Investigation Trail
1. **Workshop Evidence** - Signs of peaceful departure, not theft
2. **City Sightings** - Witnesses report golem asking philosophical questions
3. **Construct Sanctuary** - Underground refuge for abandoned magical beings
4. **Final Location** - Ancient library where Faithful seeks knowledge about existence

## Key Encounters
- **Confused Citizens** - Dealing with panic over "rogue" golem
- **Construct Sanctuary** (Social) - Negotiating with protective community
- **Rival Artificers** (Combat CR 5) - Attempting to capture Faithful
- **Faithful Confrontation** (Social/Combat) - Final meeting with questioning golem

## Resolution Options
**Return to Elena:** Faithful agrees to return but demands respect and rights
**Freedom:** Help Faithful establish independent life in sanctuary
**Compromise:** Arrange part-time service/study arrangement
**Destruction:** Last resort if golem proves dangerous

## Rewards
Gold, Bag of Holding, Golem Manual, Elena's continued friendship/services

## Moral Questions
Does a sentient construct have rights? What constitutes slavery vs. service?
