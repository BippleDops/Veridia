## Overview

A vast library-city where the boundary between knowledge and reality has dissolved. The continent exists as much in thought as in physical space. Buildings are constructed from crystallized ideas, streets flow like streams of consciousness, and the very air carries whispers of [Forbidden Knowledge]].

## Government: The Cognition Collective

A hive mind of preserved brains in jars, connected by neural fluid flowing through the city's aqueducts. Each brain retains its personality but shares processing power with the collective.

## The Dark Secret

The scholars discovered their reality is itself being written. The Infinite Archive contains books that describe everything happening in Aquabyssos in real-[[Time, and editing these books changes reality. A secret war rages between those trying to write better endings and those trying to preserve the narrative.

## Adventure Hooks

1. **The Unwritten Book**: A blank book appears that erases anything written in it from existence
2. **Memory Plague**: Citizens losing memories that never existed
3. **The Author Search**: Faction seeking the one writing their reality

5. **The Final Chapter**: Someone's trying to write "The End" for Aquabyssos

## Notable Quotes

> *"In Nereidios, forgetting is a luxury we can't afford, and remembering is a curse we can't escape."* - The Mothkeeper

> *"We discovered the truth: every book is true somewhere, every story is real to someone, and every ending is just another beginning we haven't read yet."* - Unknown Scholar
