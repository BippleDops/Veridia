# Emperor Thalassius the Deep-Crowned
*The Shadow Emperor, He Who Speaks with Depths, First of the Parliament*

## Overview
Emperor Thalassius has ruled [[Aquabyssos]] for over three centuries, though most believe he has only reigned for fifty years. Born during the great submersion of the surface world, he was among the first to successfully bond with shadow essence, allowing him to survive the transformation that created the underwater realm. Now ancient beyond mortal years, he maintains power through a complex web of political manipulation, shadow magic, and genuine care for his transformed people.

  - Eyes that shift between human pupils and complete shadow
  - Gills along his neck (usually hidden)
  - Crown of living coral and shadow-crystal
  - Fingers slightly webbed, nails like black pearls

## Personality
- **Public Face**: Wise, measured, paternal to his people
- **Private Nature**: Melancholic, burdened by centuries of rule
