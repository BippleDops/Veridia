## Ecology
**Environment**: Arid tombs

**Organization**: Solitary or pack (2–12)

## Description
These creatures resemble black-furrred jackals, but they are limned with a flickering fire that appears to be burning shadow, and casts shadow instead of light. They haunt ancient tombs. Possibly they are shackled to such tombs as guardians by ancient magic, or possibly they are just drawn to the aura of death that permeates such places; the precise relation of the jackals to their tomb-lairs is not known. They are undead, but they do not decay like normal undead and they are fully corporeal.

These jackals are surrounded by a nimbus of shadow that looks exactly like flickering flames but casting only darkness instead of light. In combat, a 5-foot sphere of this darkness can detach itself from each creature and wander the battlefield almost like an independent entity. It engulfs the jackal’s foes with necrotic energy and saps their life relentlessly.
