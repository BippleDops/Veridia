Your body becomes blurred. For the duration, any creature has [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on attack rolls against you. An attacker is immune to this effect if it perceives you with [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/senses#Blindsight|Blindsight]] or [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/senses#Truesight|Truesight]].

## Lore Details

Legends speak of blur xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around blur xphb.

## Adventure Hooks
