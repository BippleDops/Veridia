A banderhobb is a hybrid of shadow and flesh. Through vile magic, these components take on an enormous and horrific upright shape resembling a bipedal toad. In this form, a banderhobb temporarily serves its creator as a thug, a thief, and a kidnapper that swallows the unwary.

Hags have devised a ritual for creating banderhobbsâ€”a hag who knows the ritual might be willing to teach it for the right price. Some other wicked Fey and powerful Fiends also know of the process, as do a few mortal mages.

During its brief existence, a banderhobb attempts to carry out its creator's bidding. It accomplishes its mission with no concern for the harm it suffers or causes. Its only desire is to serve and succeed. A banderhobb that is assigned to track down a target is particularly dangerous when it is provided with a lock of hair, a personal belonging, or another object connected to the target. Possession of such an item allows it to sense the creature's location from as far as a mile away.

A banderhobb fulfills its duties until its existence ends. When it expires, usually several days after its birth, it leaves behind only tarry goo and wisps of shadow. Legends tell of an ominous tower in the Shadowfell where the shadows sometimes reform and banderhobbs roam.
