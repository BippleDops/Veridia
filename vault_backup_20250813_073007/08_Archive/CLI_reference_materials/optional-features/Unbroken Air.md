# Unbroken Air
*Source: Player's Handbook p. 81*  

You can create a blast of compressed air that strikes like a mighty fist. As an action, you can spend 2 ki points and choose a creature within 30 feet of you. That creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes `3d10` bludgeoning damage, plus an extra `d10` bludgeoning damage for each additional ki point you spend, and you can push the creature up to 20 feet away from you and knock it [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Prone|prone]]. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and you don't push it or knock it [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Prone|prone]].

## Player-Facing Summary

Unbroken air is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of unbroken air as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around unbroken air.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties unbroken air to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at unbroken air to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to unbroken air active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
