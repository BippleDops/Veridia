- -- # Session 8: [[Between Two Worlds > *Reality fractures. The party exists simultaneously in Meridian and Aquabyssos.* ## 🔧 [Deep Evaluation]] Improvements * 20 targeted improvements identified* ### [[Planning Improvements - Define clear objectives for the session ### [Structure Improvements]] - Create scene-by-scene breakdown ### [[Contingency Improvements - Prepare for different player choices ### [Engagement Improvements]] - Ensure each player gets spotlight moment ### [[Props Improvements - List physical props and handouts to prepare ### [Foreshadowing Improvements]] - Plant seeds for future sessions ### [[Mood Improvements - Define intended emotional arc ### [Environment Improvements]] - Use environment as active element ### [[Voices Improvements - Note distinct NPC [voices]] and mannerisms ### [[Rulings Improvements - Pre-decide on likely rule questions ### X_Factor Improvements - Add one surprising element ### [Meta Improvements]] - Address any table/player issues ## 🎬 [[Strong Start Reality fractures. The party exists simultaneously in [[[Port Meridian]]|[[Port Meridian]] and [[Aquabyssos|Aquabyssos. They see the same location in two timelines - the current festival disaster and the ancient catastrophe that created the [Drowned God]]. They must navigate both realities, as actions in one affect the other. The bloodline carrier begins fragmenting across dimensions. ## 🔍 Secrets & Clues 1. [[The Drowned God was an emergency protocol gone wrong 2. Aquabyssos's magic could solve Aethermoor's problems
3. The entity feeds on isolation between worlds
4. [Ancient Aquabyssos]] had peaceful surface relations
5. [[[[The Crimson Sage|[The Crimson]] Sage]] is burning her life force as fuel
6. [[The Queen's love for her people can break the possession
7. Time is circular in this space - endings create beginnings
8. [The Festival]] was always meant to be a bridge ceremony
9. The seven shards contain seven different solutions
10. Unity of purpose can rewrite fundamental laws ## 🎭 [[Cliffhanger Ending The party succeeds in beginning the rewriting process. Reality stabilizes into a new configuration - [Aquabyssos|Aquabyssos]] rises but as floating districts above [[[[Port Meridian|[Port Meridian]]]], connected by crystalline bridges. Water flows upward in certain areas. The two civilizations can see each other, learn from each other. But the bloodline carrier stands at the center, their body becoming the living seal between worlds. They have one choice: remain as an eternal guardian, conscious but transformed, or pass the burden to another. [[The Queen, free from possession, approaches with tears: "There is another way. The crown can hold the seal, but someone must wear it forever, ruling both worlds but belonging to neither." The entity's voice echoes one last time: "Choose quickly. The window closes at dawn." ## 📝 DM Notes```[Reality Management]]: - Actions in past affect present
