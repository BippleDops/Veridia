*Weapon, major (requires attunement by a creature that has psionic ability)* - **Damage**: `dice: 2d6` slashing
- **Properties**: [[item properties#Heavy|Heavy, [item-properties#Two-Handed|Two-Handed]]
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs. You have a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. On a critical hit against a target in an astral body (as with the [[astral-projection-xphb (spells) spell), you can cut the silvery cord that tethers the target to its material body, instead of dealing damage. *Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 89* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Silver sword mtf is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of silver sword mtf as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around silver sword mtf. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [Master_Item_Catalog]]
