The Parliament High Council serves as the supreme governing body of Aquabyssos, representing the various districts and factions within the underwater city. Composed of elected representatives from each major current and district, the Council deliberates on matters of city-wide importance, from trade regulations to defense against abyssal threats. The Council chamber, located within the Parliament of Echoes, features a circular amphitheater where voices carry with supernatural clarity through the water. The High Council operates under ancient protocols established during the city's founding, balancing democratic representation with the practical needs of underwater goverce. Each Council session begins with the Ritual of Depths, where members invoke the protection of Aquan deities and pledge to speak truth despite the crushing weight of political pressure. ## Structure

**Leadership:** Speaker of the Deep (currently Thalassa Deepvoice)
**Members:** 21 elected Councilors representing major districts
**Term:** 7 years (one per tidal cycle)
**Meeting Schedule:** Weekly during High Tide, emergency sessions as needed ## Political Factions

**The Depth Traditionalists:** Favor isolationism and ancient customs
**The Surface Progressives:** Support increased surface world contact
**The Neutral Current:** Moderate faction seeking balanced policies
**The Shadow Bloc:** Secretive members with hidden agendas ## Current Issues

The Council faces mounting pressure over the Crystal Plague crisis, with heated debates about quarantine measures and resource allocation. The Shadow Conspiracy investigation has created deep divisions, as some councilors demand transparency while others fear exposing city secrets. Trade disputes with surface merchants threaten economic stability, while reports of increased abyssal activity demand military attention. ## Secret Activities

Beneath the public facade, certain Council members engage in private negotiations with shadow organizations. The "Deep Session" meetings occur monthly in hidden chambers, where the most sensitive matters are discussed away from public scrutiny. Some councilors maintain secret alliances with surface agents, while others have ties to the abyssal cults. ## Public Perception

Citizens view the Council with mixed feelings - respect for the democratic process balanced against frustration with bureaucratic delays. The recent corruption scandals have damaged public trust, though Speaker Deepvoice's reputation for integrity helps maintain legitimacy. Street protests occasionally demand more transparent goverce. ## Adventure Hooks
