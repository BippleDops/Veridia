*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/eyes-of-the-eagle.webp#right)


These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on Wisdom ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Perception|Perception]]) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.
