# Boom's Garden
## Overview
In all my travels I have seen many miraculous things: penitent dragons, lusty paladins, a pair of dwarf and elf drinking buddies—even the world-shattering war of the Avatars. None of it, however, has amazed and stupefied me as much as the appearance of armored undergarments: scale-mail loincloths, [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items for Dungeons & Dragons 5e SRD/Chain|chain]]-mail brassieres, plate-mail bustiers—I once even saw a berserker rush into battle wearing nothing more than a narrow strip of gold about his waist. (He was dispatched by the first blow.) The advent and popularity of these flashy pieces of (non)armor have set my mind to wonder: why do people wear such armor? what sort of protection does it afford? do the protected members contain regenerative qualities that will aid the rest of the body after it has been hacked to bits? what odd sports do these folk engage in that armored undergarments would aid them? Plagued for months by such questions, I at last found the answer to my question, as well as finding the maker and seller of such finery—Boom’s Garden of Waterdeep. This unique shop is set up in the smoke-blackened brick warehouse of a failed gnome inventor, and I daresay the shop packs more explosive power now than ever. The proprietor is a woman who goes by the name Kar and can wield smithing tools better than any five men put together. In the scant 15 minutes I spent wandering about the shop, I discovered [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Items|items]] that still amaze me. Many of them I cannot offer in this catalogue of mine, but you will find a few of the choice (and tame) selections in the following pages. All must be special ordered with complete measurements to insure a perfect fit. Small and medium sizes cost the prices shown; large and extra large are half again more.
