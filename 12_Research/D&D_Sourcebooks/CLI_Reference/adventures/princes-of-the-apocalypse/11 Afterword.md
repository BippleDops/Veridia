--- # Afterword

*Source: Princes of the Apocalypse, p. 251* > [!note] > > For the Elemental Evil story, we tried to bring the elemental cults to life in a way that we'd never done before. We also wanted to make sure that each cult had its own identity and recurring motifs. Water cultists have scaly skin. Air cultists use elemental devices, such as *balloon packs* and *wingwear*, to fly. Fire cultists harness the forge to create all sorts of fiery implements and weird ironworks. Earth cultists meld their flesh with stone.

> Because the cultists are insane, it's easy to imagine many crazy ideas. Water cultists riding giant walruses! Earth cultists with purple worm hatcheries! It's all good. This appendix contains a sampling of the concept art we commissioned for the Elemental Evil story, not all of which ended up in this adventure. Sometimes we went in directions that proved too wacky for our tastes, but hopefully you'll see something here that inspires you.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of 11 afterword as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around 11 afterword. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A shipment has gone missing and truth emerges
