## Description
The Loudwater Vale produces some of the richest cheeses in the North. This soft white cheese is called the Ethereal Cheese by the elves, for if sliced thinly it becomes translucent while retaining all of its succulent bite. Mist cheese owes much of its appearance and taste to its ripening in nearby caves, and the unique taste of Mist has never been duplicated elsewhere. Truly a taste delight! Available only in 1 lb loaves (2 gp).
