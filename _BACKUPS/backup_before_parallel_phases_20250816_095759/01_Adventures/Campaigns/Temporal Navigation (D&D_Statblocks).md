Unlike surface world magic that treats time as a rigid construct, the crushing pressures and eldritch influences of the deep ocean create natural **chronological currents** that can be ridden by those who understand their patterns. The practice originated with the [Elder Deep]] entities who first discovered that the immense pressure of the ocean depths created gravitational distortions strong enough to bend spacetime. Over millennia, this knowledge has been refined by the [[Deepcaster mages and the [Temporal Guardians]], creating a sophisticated system of time travel that functions more like ocean navigation than traditional chronology magic. ### Primary Chronostreams Throughout [[Aquabyssos, massive **temporal currents** flow like underwater rivers, carrying time energy from past to future and occasionally creating loops, eddies, and backflows. The major currents include: #### The Prime Current

The strongest and most stable temporal flow, moving from the distant past toward the far future. This current carries the "main timeline" and is used for long-distance temporal travel. It flows at a consistent rate of 1 year per mile traveled. **Navigation Hazards:**
- **Temporal Rapids**: **DC 18** Wisdom save or be swept `dice: 1d6` years off course
- **Chronological Whirlpools**: Can trap travelers in temporal loops
- **Time Storms**: Chaotic periods where past and future collide #### The Echo Stream

A secondary current that carries reflections and echoes of significant historical events. Travelers can observe the past but cannot interact with it directly. The stream flows at varying speeds, sometimes showing events in real-time, other times accelerating through centuries in minutes. #### The Probability Current

The most dangerous of the major streams, this current carries potential futures and alternate timelines. Exposure to its flow can cause:
- **Temporal Displacement**: Spontaneous jumps to alternate realities
- **Paradox Sickness**: Physical manifestation of timeline contradictions
- **Future Memory**: Remembering events that haven't happened yet #### The Stagt Pools

Areas where temporal flow has stopped entirely, creating pockets of frozen time. These zones are highly sought after by researchers but extremely dangerous:
- Time inside moves at 1% normal speed
- Travelers can become permanently trapped
- Objects and creatures from different eras may be preserved here
- Entry requires specialized [Temporal Diving Equipment]] #### Chrono-Eddies

Small circular currents that can carry travelers backward in time for short periods (hours to days). Often used for reconnaissance or to correct recent mistakes. #### Temporal Rifts

Cracks in spacetime that provide direct access to specific historical moments. Highly unstable and often guarded by [[Temporal Sentinels. #### Time Bubbles

Isolated pockets where time flows at different rates. Some accelerate aging and healing, others slow it dramatically. Used by the [The Deep Sovereign|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Sovereign]] for extended contemplation. #### Pressure Chronometry

The original technique developed by the [[Elder Deep, using the relationship between water pressure and gravitational time dilation to measure temporal flow. Practitioners learn to:
- Feel time distortions through pressure changes
- Predict temporal weather patterns
- Navigate by "temporal pressure gradients"
- Sense paradoxes and timeline instabilities **Pressure Chronometry** (Skill)
- Requires proficiency in [Arcana]] and [[Temporal Sciences
- DC varies based on complexity: 15 for basic navigation, 25 for paradox detection
- Failure can result in temporal displacement or time sickness #### Current Reading

Similar to reading ocean currents for navigation, temporal current reading involves:
- Observing the flow of temporal energy through specialized senses
- Using [Chronological Compass]] devices to detect direction
- Following "temporal landmarks" - events that create permanent distortions
- Avoiding dangerous areas like [[Paradox Storms and [Timeline Fractures]] #### Temporal Diving Bells

Pressurized vessels that allow groups to travel through time while maintaining environmental protection. These craft feature:
- **Chronological Stabilizers**: Prevent temporal displacement
- **Paradox Shielding**: Protect against timeline contradictions
- **Temporal Anchors**: Allow return to original timeline
- **Emergency Temporal Beacons**: Signal for rescue across time **Temporal Diving Bell**

Sophisticated devices that can detect and map temporal currents across vast areas. The [[Inverse Palace maintains the most advanced array, capable of:
- Predicting temporal weather up to 1000 years in advance
- Detecting timeline alterations and paradoxes
- Tracking temporal travelers across multiple timelines
- Coordinating large-scale temporal operations #### Temporal Anchor Stations

Fixed installations that serve as reference points in the timestream. These stations:

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Temporal Navigation as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Temporal Navigation. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Strange disappearances suggest a curse
