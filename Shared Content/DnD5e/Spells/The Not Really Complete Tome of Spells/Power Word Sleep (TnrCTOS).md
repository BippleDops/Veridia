# Power Word Sleep (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V

**Duration**: 10 minutes


## Effects
You pick a point within range. All crea-tures within a 20-foot radius that have 30 or fewer hit points fall asleep instantly. Creatures with a greater number of hit points may make a Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep. A sleeping creature will stay asleep until the spell ends, the sleeper takes dam-age, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the creature awake.
