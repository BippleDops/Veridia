- **Properties**: [[item properties#Versatile|Versatile
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs. This staff can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. It also has the following additional properties. Once one of these properties is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Lightning When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the target to take an extra``dice: 2d6``Lightning damage (no action required). ## Thunder When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can cause the staff to emit a crack of thunder audible out to 300 feet (no action required). The target you hit must succeed on a **DC 17** Constitution saving throw or have the [conditions#Stunned|Stunned]] condition until the end of your next turn. ## Thunder and Lightning Immediately after you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can take a [[Action Xphb to use the Lightning and Thunder properties (see above) at the same time. Doing so doesn't expend the daily use of those properties, only the use of this one. ## Lightning Strike You can take a [actions#Magic|Magic]] action to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the staff's tip in a [[Area of Effect Xphb that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. Each creature in that [Area of Effect Xphb]] makes a **DC 17** Dexterity saving throw, taking``dice: 9d6``Lightning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. ## Thunderclap You can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic action to cause the staff to produce a thunderclap audible out to 600 feet. Every creature within a 60-foot [Area of Effect Xphb]] originating from you makes a **DC 17** Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes``dice: 2d6``Thunder damage and has the [[conditions#Deafened|Deafened]] condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 311.
