# Merchant's Covenant
*"Knowledge Flows Like Current, Value Rises Like Pressure"*

## Organization Overview

The Merchant's Covenant represents a revolutionary fusion of commerce and scholarship unique to the depths of [[Aquabyssos World Overview]]. Founded by drowned traders and scholars who recognized that information had become more valuable than gold in the transformed world, the Covenant operates as both a merchant consortium and an academic institution.

Unlike surface merchants who deal in physical goods, the Covenant trades primarily in **Knowledge, Memory, and Experience** - the three currencies of the deep. They maintain the largest mobile library in Aquabyssos aboard their flagship **The Repository Barge**, and their merchant-scholars are respected throughout the depths as both shrewd negotiators and learned researchers.

The Covenant emerged from the practical need to catalog and preserve the overwhelming changes brought by the [[Aquabyssos World Overview]]. As traditional trade goods became useless underwater, enterprising merchants pivoted to trading in navigational knowledge, transformation techniques, survival methods, and preserved pre-Drowning information.

## History and Foundation

### The Great Cataloguing (420 years post-Drowning)
In the chaos following the establishment of the [[Aquabyssos World Overview]], a consortium of twelve merchant houses united under the leadership of **Master Ledger Tidewell the Rememberer**. These houses had each specialized in preserving different types of knowledge: trade routes, cultural practices, technological methods, magical techniques, historical records, and survival strategies.

### The First Repository (415 years post-Drowning)
The Covenant commissioned the construction of **The Repository Barge**, a massive floating library-warehouse that could travel safely between all three depth levels. Using salvaged materials from drowned universities and merchant guilds, they created the first mobile center of learning in the post-Drowning world.

### The Memory Wars (380-375 years post-Drowning)
During a period of intense factional conflict, the Covenant's neutrality and information brokerage made them invaluable to all sides. Their policy of "Knowledge for all who can pay" helped end several conflicts through strategic information sharing, establishing their reputation as honest brokers.

### The Deep Expansion (200 years post-Drowning)
The Covenant established permanent trading posts at all major depth transition points, creating a network that facilitates not just commerce but also information exchange between the radically different depth societies.

## Leadership Structure

### The Archive Council
**Archmerchant Codex Goldstream**: The current leader, a methodically transformed scholar whose body has been modified to store vast amounts of information in bioluminescent data-nodes along their spine. They can recall any piece of information the Covenant has ever acquired and speak twelve pre-Drowning languages fluently.

**Deputy Archmerchant Scroll Deepmind**: Codex's chosen successor, specializing in psychological and sociological knowledge. They maintain extensive files on the behavioral patterns of all major factions and leaders.

## Goals and Methods

### Primary Objectives

#### Knowledge Preservation
The Covenant sees themselves as the guardians of civilization's memory, working to ensure that no crucial information is lost to the depths or the passage of time. They actively seek out and preserve knowledge from all sources.

#### Information Democratization
While they charge for their services, the Covenant believes that knowledge should be available to all who can afford it, regardless of faction or background. They maintain neutrality to serve all clients equally.

#### Economic Stability
By facilitating trade and information flow between all factions and depth levels, the Covenant helps maintain economic stability throughout Aquabyssos. Their neutral status makes them essential mediators.

#### Cultural Bridge-Building
The Covenant works to maintain connections between the increasingly isolated depth societies, serving as cultural ambassadors and facilitating understanding between radically different communities.

### Methodologies

#### Active Intelligence Gathering
The Covenant maintains networks of informants, researchers, and field agents throughout Aquabyssos and even extending to surface contacts. They pride themselves on being the first to learn of major developments.

#### Neutral Mediation
By maintaining strict neutrality and confidentiality, the Covenant serves as trusted mediators for conflicts and negotiations between factions. Their reputation for honesty is their most valuable asset.

#### Educational Services  
Beyond trading in knowledge, the Covenant provides educational services: tutoring, research assistance, cultural orientation, and skill training for clients adapting to new depth levels or situations.

#### Research and Development
The Covenant actively funds research into new techniques, technologies, and magical methods. They often commission studies from independent scholars or partner with other organizations for large projects.

## Relationships with Other Factions

### Valued Clients

#### [[Order of the Drowned Star|Order of the Drowned Star]]
**Relationship**: Scholarly Partnership
The Covenant provides historical and astronomical knowledge to the Order, while receiving navigation data and star-charts. Both organizations value knowledge preservation and maintain close scholarly cooperation.

#### [[Aquabyssos World Overview]]
**Relationship**: Official Consultants
The Covenant serves as information consultants to the government, providing intelligence reports, cultural analysis, and policy recommendations. They maintain careful political neutrality while serving state interests.

#### Independent Scholars and Researchers
**Relationship**: Academic Collaboration
The Covenant partners with individual scholars throughout Aquabyssos, providing resources and funding in exchange for research results and exclusive access to discoveries.

### Complex Relationships

#### [[Aquabyssos World Overview]]
**Relationship**: Cautious Commerce
While philosophically opposed to the Deep Dreamers' goals, the Covenant trades with them for unique Hadean Depth knowledge. They're careful not to provide information that could accelerate dangerous transformations.

#### [[Aquabyssos World Overview]]
**Relationship**: Necessary Neutrality
The Resurgent Tide distrusts the Covenant's surface contacts but needs their services for intelligence and logistics. The Covenant maintains strict confidentiality to preserve this difficult relationship.

#### [[Aquabyssos World Overview]]
**Relationship**: Sympathetic Support
Many Covenant members are personally sympathetic to the Surface Seekers' goals, and they provide significant research support for transformation reversal studies, while maintaining public neutrality.

### Challenging Relationships

#### [[Aquabyssos World Overview]]
**Relationship**: Dangerous Clients
The Void Touched pay extremely well for Hadean Depth intelligence, but their transformations make them increasingly difficult to understand and trust. Some Covenant members fear they're enabling dangerous experiments.

#### Radical Isolationist Factions
**Relationship**: Philosophical Opposition
Some depth communities oppose the Covenant's information sharing as dangerous contamination. These groups sometimes attempt to restrict or attack Covenant operations in their territories.
