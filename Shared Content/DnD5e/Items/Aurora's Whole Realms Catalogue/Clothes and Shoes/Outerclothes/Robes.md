## Description
Robes are the perfect way to cuddle up in front of the fire on a blustery day, or to plan and create a new spell or potion. We offer robes for everyone. A basic linen or wool robe costs only 9 sp, with your choice of colors. For that classy mage whoâ€™s headed toward the royal court, we also offer a silk variety for 95 sp, same color options. A fur lining may be added for 75 gp to any of the above styles. Even the Red Wizards of Thay buy robes here!
