The Shadow Markets operate as a vast underground network of illegal trade beneath [[Port Meridian|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]], controlled by [[The Whisper Syndicate|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/The Whisper Syndicate]] and serving as the primary distribution hub for all manner of forbidden goods, from corrupted crystals to stolen artifacts to living beings. ## Operations & Connections

The markets specialize in corrupted crystal trade, stolen artifacts from [[The Sundered Vaults|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Sundered Vaults]], weapons from [[The Crimson Foundries|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Crimson Foundries]], and information brokerage. The network connects to [[The Bone Colosseum|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Bone Colosseum]] via hidden tunnels and serves as money laundering operation for [[Vex Shadowthorn|02 Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]]'s criminal empire. ## Player-Facing Summary The Shadow Markets New is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Shadow Markets New as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around The Shadow Markets New. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A noble needs help delivering before the new moon
