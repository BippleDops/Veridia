--- # Tasha's Hideous Laughter

*1st-level, Enchantment* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tart and a feather)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute One creature of your choice that you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has the [[conditions#prone|Prone and [conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] conditions for the duration. During that time, it laughs uncontrollably if it's capable of laughter, and it can't end the [[conditions#prone|Prone condition on itself. At the end of each of its turns and each time it takes damage, it makes another Wisdom saving throw. The target has [Advantage Xphb]] on the save if the save is triggered by damage. On a successful save, the spell ends. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1. **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 331.
