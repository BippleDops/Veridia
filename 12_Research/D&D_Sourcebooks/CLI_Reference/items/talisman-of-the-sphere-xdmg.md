- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

While holding or wearing this talisman, you have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on any Intelligence ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Arcana|Arcana]]) check you make to control a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/sphere-of-annihilation-xdmg|Sphere of Annihilation]]. In addition, when you start your turn in control of a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/sphere-of-annihilation-xdmg|Sphere of Annihilation]], you can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action to move it 10 feet plus a number of additional feet equal to 10 times your Intelligence modifier. This movement doesn't have to be in a straight line.
