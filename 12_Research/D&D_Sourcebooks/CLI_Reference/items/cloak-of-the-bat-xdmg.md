# Cloak of the Bat
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  

While wearing this cloak, you have [[advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on Dexterity ([[skills#Stealth|Stealth]]) checks. In an area of [[dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] or [[darkness-xphb|Darkness]], you can grip the edges of the cloak and use it to gain a [[fly-speed-xphb|Fly Speed]] of 40 feet. If you ever fail to grip the cloak's edges while flying in this way, or if you are no longer in [[dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] or [[darkness-xphb|Darkness]], you lose this [[fly-speed-xphb|Fly Speed]].

While wearing the cloak in an area of [[dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] or [[darkness-xphb|Darkness]], you can cast [[polymorph-xphb|Polymorph]] on yourself, shape-shifting into a [[bat-xmm|Bat]]. While in that form, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The cloak can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
