# The Shadow War Coalition
*Unity Born From Darkness*

## Overview

The Shadow War Coalition emerged as a temporary military alliance formed during the escalating conflict between shadow-enhanced forces and traditional authorities in [[Aquabyssos]]. What began as disparate shadow-using groups fighting individual battles evolved into a coordinated war effort when conventional forces proved unable to counter shadow magic tactics.

This coalition represents the largest organized military use of shadow magic in [[Aquabyssos]] history. Unlike permanent organizations, the Coalition exists solely for the duration of the shadow conflict, bringing together former enemies under unified command to fight a war that threatens to tear the underwater kingdom apart.

The Coalition operates under the philosophy that shadow magic, long feared and suppressed, represents the next evolution of warfare. They believe traditional military doctrine is obsolete and that only shadow-enhanced tactics can protect [[Aquabyssos]] from both internal corruption and external threats.

## History and Formation

### The Escalation Crisis
The Coalition formed when three separate shadow-related conflicts merged into city-wide warfare:
- **[[The Shadow Conspiracy]]** operations against government corruption
- **[[Shadow Surgeons Collective]]** resistance to medical regulation

### The Unity Accords
Desperate shadow organizations met in secret to coordinate their efforts:
- Shared intelligence networks and operational resources
- Unified command structure for major military operations
- Combined training programs for shadow combat techniques
- Coordinated propaganda and information warfare

### The War Declaration
The Coalition officially declared war when:
- Government forces began mass arrests of shadow magic users
- [[Parliament of Echoes]] passed emergency laws banning shadow practices
- [[Crystal Wardens]] launched coordinated strikes against shadow facilities
