The airship, a heroic piece of engineering, is fashioned from cloudstone and brass. Life on the boat takes on a painterly aesthetic featuring decor of a culturally coherent nature, without the inclusion of modern technologies. Wind-swept forms abound across the scene, complementing the atmospheric special effects that bolster the representation of the impending storm. The colors range from navy and gold to cloud-white, with warm sun highlights accentuating the pedal. Please keep in mind to refrain from using wordings or signboards, instead incorporate meaningful symbols or numbered pins.",
