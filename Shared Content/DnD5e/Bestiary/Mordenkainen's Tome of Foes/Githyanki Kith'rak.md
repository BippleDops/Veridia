## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The githyanki's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

At Will: *mage hand (the hand is invisible)*
3/day each: *blur, jump, misty step, nondetection (self only)*
1/day each: *plane shift, telekinesis*

***Rally the Troops.*** As a bonus action, the githyanki can magically end the charmed and frightened conditions on itself and each creature of its choice that it can see within 30 feet of it.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The githyanki makes three greatsword attacks.

***Greatsword.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 ( `dice: 2d6+4`) slashing damage plus 17 ( `dice: 5d6`) psychic damage.

## Reactions
***Parry.*** The githyanki adds 4 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the githyanki must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

## Description
The githyanki's militarized culture assigns ranks and responsibilities to its citizens. Groups of ten warriors follow the commands of the sarths (githyanki warriors), while ten sarths obey the commands of the mighty kith'rak. These champions earn their status through torturous training and psionic testing until they can command the respect of their underlings.
