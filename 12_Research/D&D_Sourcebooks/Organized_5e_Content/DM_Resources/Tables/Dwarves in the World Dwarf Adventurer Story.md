| dice: d6 | Hook |
|----------|------|
| 1 | You were accused of stealing a fellow artisan's item and claiming it as your work. Innocent or guilty, you were made an outcast. |
| 2 | Your wanderlust prompted you to shirk your duties as a crafter in favor of wandering the world. Your clan isn't pleased with this choice. |
| 3 | You became separated from your clan due to an earthquake, a drow slave raid, or similar event and hope to return home. |
| 4 | You were assigned to become a merchant by the priests of Moradin and have yet to forgive them for their mistake. You should be working a forge, not wandering the outside world! |
| 5 | You are a spy, traveling incognito to gather information for the clan elders. |
| 6 | You struggle to resist the lure of Abbathor, but can't hold it at bay. Better to walk the world and sate your greed on non-dwarves. |
