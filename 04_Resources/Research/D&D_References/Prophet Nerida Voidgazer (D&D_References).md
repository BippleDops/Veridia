Prophet Nerida Voidgazer leads the [[Church of the Tidal Throne from [The Sunken Cathedral of Stars|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Sunken Cathedral Of Stars]], preaching that [[The Great Drowning was divine judgment and that worse is coming. Her eyes are pools of black water that reflect no light, supposedly allowing her to see across all depths simultaneously. She speaks in multiple voices - sometimes her own, sometimes echoing things from [The Whispering Depths|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Whispering Depths]], sometimes in tongues that predate human language. ## History

Was a young priestess when the drowning began. Tried to hold back the waters with prayer and was swept into [[The Cerulean Trench|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Cerulean Trench. Emerged three days later, changed. Has led the Church for 127 years, not aging but slowly becoming less human. Claims to have spoken with the gods beneath the waters. ## Current Activities

1. Preparing faithful for "The Second Drowning"
2. Sending missionaries to spread the word
3. Interpreting signs of [The Emergence]]
4. Building underwater temples at depth
5. Experiencing visions of increasing intensity ## The Three Sermons

Her core teachings delivered in rotating cycle:
1. **The Drowning Mercy**: Water saved us from ourselves
2. **The Depth's Embrace**: Transformation is divine will
3. **The Rising Truth**: Something greater comes ## Secrets

> [!warning] DM Only
> - Actually died in the trench and is possessed by fragment of the entity
> - Her visions are real - she's seeing the entity's memories
> - The "Second Drowning" is the entity's release
> - Can kill with a word but doesn't remember doing it
> - The gods she speaks with are the entity's split personalities ## Prophetic Visions

Recent visions she's shared:
- Cities of glass shattering in sequence
- A crown of pressure crushing a thousand heads
- The sun drowning in its own light
- Children born breathing void
- The depths ascending, the heights descending ## Player-Facing Summary Prophet Nerida Voidgazer is a void-touched element of the setting, known for impossible angles and star-silent echoes. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Prophet Nerida Voidgazer as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Prophet Nerida Voidgazer. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A document has gone missing and evil awakens

- Someone is blackmailing information for love
