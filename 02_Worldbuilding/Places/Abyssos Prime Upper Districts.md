# Abyssos Prime Upper Districts
*The Crown of the Deep Capital, Where Light Still Remembers the Surface*

## Overview
The Upper Districts of [[Abyssos Prime]] represent the pinnacle of Aquabyssos civilization - both literally and figuratively. Built in the shallower waters where filtered sunlight can still penetrate, these districts house the empire's nobility, government officials, and wealthy merchants. Grand coral palaces rise from cultivated reef platforms, connected by graceful current-bridges that allow citizens to swim effortlessly between buildings. The architecture here blends the organic curves of sea life with the geometric precision of crystal-enhanced construction.
