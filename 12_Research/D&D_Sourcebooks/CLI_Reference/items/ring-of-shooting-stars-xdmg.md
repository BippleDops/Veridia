# Ring of Shooting Stars
*Ring, very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/ring-of-shooting-stars.webp#right)


You can cast [[dancing-lights-xphb|Dancing Lights]] or [[light-xphb|Light]] from the ring.

The ring has 6 charges and regains `d6` expended charges daily at dawn. You can expend its charges to use the properties below.

## Faerie Fire

You can expend 1 charge to cast [[faerie-fire-xphb|Faerie Fire]] from the ring.

## Lightning Spheres

You can expend 2 charges as a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to create up to four 3-foot-diameter spheres of lightning.

Each sphere appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 120 feet of yourself. The spheres last as long as you maintain [[conditions#Concentration|Concentration]], up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds [[dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] in a 30-foot radius.

As a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]], you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from yourself. The first time the sphere comes within 5 feet of a creature other than you that isn't behind [[cover-xphb|Total Cover]], the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

| Number of Spheres | Lightning Damage |
|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | `4d12` |
| 2 | `5d4` |
| 3 | `2d6` |
| 4 | `2d4` |

## Shooting Stars

You can expend 1 to 3 charges as a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action. For every charge you expend, you launch a glowing mote of light from the ring at a point you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each creature in a 15-foot [[cube-area-of-effect-xphb|Cube]] originating from that point is showered in sparks and makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking `5d4` Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.
