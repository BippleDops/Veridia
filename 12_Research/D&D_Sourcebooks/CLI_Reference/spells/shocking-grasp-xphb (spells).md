# Shocking Grasp
*cantrip, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Lightning springs from you to a creature that you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes `d8` Lightning damage, and it can't make [[actions#Opportunity%20Attack|Opportunity Attacks]] until the start of its next turn.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by `d8` when you reach levels 5 (`2d8`), 11 (`3d8`), and 17 (`4d8`).
