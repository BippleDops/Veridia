*This tall, stocky, and powerful humanoid appears to be formed of mushroom flesh rather than normal muscle and tissue. Its rough facial features are barely discernible as crudely humanoid, and its long, thick arms end in immense, clawed hands. Instead of typical humanoid feet, its legs end in splayed, three-toed pads. Something akin to thick fur grows only on its chest, stomach, and lower back.*

## Description
Fungoids are man-sized humanoid creatures formed of mushroom flesh and leaves. Their coloration varies from brownish-green to brown to dark green to light gray with mottled brown splotches. Most weigh about 300 pounds. They are found in all but the coldest of swamps and marshes, where they delight in attacking creatures that wander too close to their lair.

Although related to fungi, fungoids are not scavengers but carnivorous hunters who consider the flesh of humans, elves, and goblins a delicacy. Only when live food is scarce do fungoids resort to scavenging for carrion.

Fungoids lair in the darkest and most dismal place they can find—the more devoid of light, the better. Typically a lair is beneath the densest tree canopy in the area and is ringed with mushrooms of many colors, shapes, and sizes. The lair itself is guaranteed to be well-hidden or camouflaged and difficult to get into. Creatures that wander close enough to actually spot the lair are already in trouble; by then the fungoids are certainly aware of the intruders’ presence and are already considering how and when to eat them.

Fungoids do most of their hunting at night, when they travel up to 5 miles away from a lair in search of prey. Slain prey is carried or dragged back to the lair and devoured over several days’ time. Fungoids often hunt in groups, but they never share their kill. “Each to its own” is the unspoken motto among fungoids.

These brutes are straightforward combatants that rush into melee swinging their powerful fists. Each fungoid selects a foe and pummels it relentlessly, single-mindedly ignoring all other threats until that one target is smashed. Multiple fungoids gang up against one foe only when that creature is obviously more powerful than any of them individually. Once the fight is over, the fungoids’ cooperation ends, and it’s back to “every creature for itself.” Fungoids seldom retreat from a fight that’s going against them unless a few believe they can reach the safety of their lair while others delay pursuit by continuing to fight (probably unaware that they’ve been abandoned).
