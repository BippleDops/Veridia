## Description
**Environment**: Any (Between)

**Organization**: Solitary

Between dreams are weak, semi-sentient dreams that form in Between rather than on the Ethereal Plane. Their true appearances are vague and nebulous, but they react to the fears and emotions of those around them, taking on increasingly nightmarish appearances that differ for each viewer. Between dreams sometimes cooperate with other [[Appendix A - Between Creatures|Between creatures]] such as Between vampires and [[Gloam|gloams]] that have associations with dreams and nightmares.
