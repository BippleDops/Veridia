# Memory Trading Economy System
*Where Experience Becomes Currency and Identity Is Negotiable*

## Core Concepts

### The Nature of Memory as Currency

In Aquabyssos and Aethermoor, memories have crystallized into tangible form through the merger of magic and pressure. These **Memory Pearls** serve as both currency and commodity, containing actual experiences that can be absorbed, traded, or destroyed.

### Memory Pearl Classifications

#### By Rarity
| Grade | Color | Base Value | Occurrence |
|-------|-------|------------|------------|
| Common | White | 10-50 gp | Daily experiences |
| Uncommon | Blue | 51-200 gp | Significant moments |
| Rare | Green | 201-1,000 gp | Life-changing events |
| Epic | Purple | 1,001-5,000 gp | Historical moments |
| Legendary | Gold | 5,001-25,000 gp | World-shaping events |
| Mythic | Prismatic | 25,000+ gp | Reality-defining experiences |

#### By Type
| Category | Examples | Market Demand | Special Properties |
|----------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Knowledge** | Skills, languages, facts | High | Grant temporary proficiency |
| **Emotional** | Love, fear, joy, grief | Variable | Affect personality |
| **Sensory** | Tastes, sounds, visions | Moderate | Enhance perception |
| **Temporal** | Past events, future glimpses | Very High | Provide information |
| **Identity** | Names, faces, relationships | Illegal* | Can steal identity |
| **Traumatic** | Pain, loss, horror | Low/Specialized | Used in torture/therapy |

*Identity memories are illegal in most civilized areas but trade on black markets
