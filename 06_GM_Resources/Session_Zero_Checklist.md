- **Adaptation**: Physical and social transformation
- **Politics**: Faction warfare and diplomacy
- **Mystery**: Ancient secrets and prophecies
- **Horror**: Cosmic entities and madness
- **Choice**: No perfect solutions

### Tone Calibration
Rate 1-5 for your campaign:
- **Serious ←→ Comedic**: [1][2][3][4][5]
- **Heroic ←→ Gritty**: [1][2][3][4][5]
- **Linear ←→ Sandbox**: [1][2][3][4][5]
- **Combat ←→ Roleplay**: [1][2][3][4][5]
- **Mystery ←→ Action**: [1][2][3][4][5]
