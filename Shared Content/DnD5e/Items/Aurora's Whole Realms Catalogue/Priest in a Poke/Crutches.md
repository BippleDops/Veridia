## Description
Once a leg is straightened and splinted, the next priority is ambulation. We offer sturdy hardwood crutches in two sizes— demihuman (3') and human (4'6"). (Elves should order human size.) Each of these sizes is in turn variable by the addition of wood armpit rests of varying heights. When ordering, please specify the size of the crutch and the height of the armpit rest (in inch increments). Demihuman: 4 gp; human: 6 gp; armpit rest (all sizes): 1 gp.

## Additional Details
allows characters with one wounded leg to move at ½ movement rate; two wounded legs moves 1/6 regular movement (at DM’s discretion)
