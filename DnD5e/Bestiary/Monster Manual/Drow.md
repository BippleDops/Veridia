## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting.*** The drow's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 11). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: *dancing lights*
1/day each: *darkness, faerie fire*

***Fey Ancestry.*** The drow has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put the drow to sleep.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the drow has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions
***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d6+2`) piercing damage.

***Hand Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d6+2`) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

## Additional Details
**VARIANT: DROW MAGIC ARMOR AND WEAPONS** Drow often wear magic armor and carry magic weapons that lose their enhancement bonuses permanently if they are exposed to sunlight for 1 hour or longer.

A drow wearing a +1 chain shirt and carrying a+ 7 shortsword has AC 19 and a + 1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.
