# Stonky's ring

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Ring

**Rarity:** unknown (magic)

**Attunement**: *requires attunement*

## Description

While wearing this ring, you can cast the [[telekinesis]]  spell at will, but you can target only objects that aren't being worn or carried. 

Any character who attunes to the ring gains control of Stonky's creations, though the [[skitterwidget|skitterwidgets]] ignore commands spoken more than 30 feet away from them.
