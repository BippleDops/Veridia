*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)* While wearing this cloak, you have [[Advantage Xphb on Dexterity ([skills#Stealth|Stealth]]) checks. In an area of [[Light Xphb or [darkness-xphb (variant-rules)]], you can grip the edges of the cloak and use it to gain a [[Fly Speed Xphb of 40 feet. If you ever fail to grip the cloak's edges while flying in this way, or if you are no longer in [Light Xphb]] or [[darkness-xphb (variant-rules), you lose this [Fly Speed Xphb]]. While wearing the cloak in an area of [[Light Xphb or [darkness-xphb (variant-rules)]], you can cast [[true-polymorph-xphb (spells) on yourself, shape-shifting into a [Giant Bat Xmm]]. While in that form, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The cloak can't be used this way again until the next dawn. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 245.

Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around cloak of the bat xdmg. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
