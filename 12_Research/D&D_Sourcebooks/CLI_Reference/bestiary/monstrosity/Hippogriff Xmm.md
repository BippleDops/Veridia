## Hippogriff

*World-Traveling Hunter and Steed*

- **Habitat.** Grassland, Hill, Mountain  
- **Treasure.** None  

Part hunting bird, part horse, hippogriffs are majestic creatures that hunt opportunistically as they migrate, often targeting lone travelers and livestock. Hippogriffs might carry riders with them in their travels in return for food or other aid.

Hippogriff migrations might take months or years, and sages frequently predict their routes. Roll on or choose a result from the Hippogriff Destination table to inspire where a hippogriff might be en route to.
