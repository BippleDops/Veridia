--- # Screaming Tree Guardians *"Their cries echo through wood and water, warning all who would harm the ancient groves."* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Screaming Tree Guardians are sentient plant creatures that have evolved to protect underwater kelp forests and surface woodlands through the use of devastating sonic attacks. These guardians can produce ear-piercing shrieks that disorient enemies, call for help from other forest creatures, and even cause physical damage through focused sound waves. ### Duration

Permanent guardians active indefinitely while forest remains healthy. ## Adventure Hooks

1. **Guardian Negotiation**: Peaceful passage requires diplomatic approach
2. **Forest Defense**: Join guardians in protecting grove from destruction
3. **Silent Approach**: Infiltration mission requiring stealth to avoid detection ## Campaign Use

Provides environmental challenges and opportunities for characters to interact with nature-based protectors. ## Player-Facing Summary Screaming Tree Guardians is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Screaming Tree Guardians as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Screaming Tree Guardians. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A corpse reveals the truth about the cult
