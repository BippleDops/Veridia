# Quandrix Trinket
*Adventuring gear*  



When you make your character, you may roll once on the Quandrix Trinkets table, instead of on the [Trinkets table](/3-Mechanics/CLI/items/trinket-xphb.md) in the "Player's Handbook", for your starting trinket.

**Quandrix Trinkets**

| dice: d6 | Trinket |
|----------|---------|
| 1 | A small succulent in a dodecahedral clay pot |
| 2 | A blue knit hat that looks a bit like a bottle folding in on itself |
| 3 | A model hypercube carved from green crystal, showcasing the fourth dimension |
| 4 | A crumpled test on the theory of gravity manipulation, with a failing grade on the front and the name of a famous Quandrix professor |
| 5 | A blue tetrahedron that, when tapped twice, projects a recording of an old mathematics lecture |
| 6 | A round bread roll cut so that someone could spread butter on both halves without ever lifting the knife |
