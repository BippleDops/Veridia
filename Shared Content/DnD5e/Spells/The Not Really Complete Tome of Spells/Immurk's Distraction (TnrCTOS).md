# Immurk's Distraction (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a scattering of sand and 500 gp worth of diamond dust)

**Duration**: 24 hours


## Effects
You touch an item and then conceal it in or under something. As long as that item

remains concealed, nobody will find that item by accident—the creature will simply look a little bit to the side or make another mistake that keeps it from finding the object—and creatures deliberately looking for it have disadvantage on all ability checks made to locate it. Finally, all cantrip and 1st-level

divinations will fail to find it.
