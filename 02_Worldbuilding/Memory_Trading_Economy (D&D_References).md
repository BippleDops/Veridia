--- # Memory Trading Economy System

*Where Experience Becomes Currency and Identity Is Negotiable* ### The Nature of Memory as Currency In Aquabyssos and Aethermoor, memories have crystallized into tangible form through the merger of magic and pressure. These **Memory Pearls** serve as both currency and commodity, containing actual experiences that can be absorbed, traded, or destroyed. #### By Rarity

|-------|-------|------------|------------|
| Common | White | 10-50 gp | Daily experiences |
| Uncommon | Blue | 51-200 gp | Significant moments |
| Rare | Green | 201-1,000 gp | Life-changing events |
| Epic | Purple | 1,001-5,000 gp | Historical moments |
| Legendary | Gold | 5,001-25,000 gp | World-shaping events |
| Mythic | Prismatic | 25,000+ gp | Reality-defining experiences | #### By Type
