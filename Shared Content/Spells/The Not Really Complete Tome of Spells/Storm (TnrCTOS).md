# Storm (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *8th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: Self (10-mile radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (a lightning rod or a branch from a which has been struck by lightning at least once)

**Duration**: 12 hours


## Effects
You cause a horrendous thunderstorm to develop over the course of half an hour and rage for 12 hours. Rain falls at the rate of 1/2 inch per hour.

Once every 10 minutes, you may direct a lightning bolt to hit a target of your choice. If the target is a living being, it may make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 4d8 lightning damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.
