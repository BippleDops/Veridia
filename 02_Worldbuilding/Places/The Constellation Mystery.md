# The Constellation Mystery

*"When stars align beneath the waves, ancient truths surface."*

## Overview
A mystical investigation where the underwater constellation patterns visible from Aquabyssos have begun changing, causing magical disturbances throughout the city. Ancient star charts suggest this phenomenon occurs only during times of great cosmic significance.

Scholars and mystics believe the shifting constellations herald either great fortune or terrible catastrophe.

## The Phenomenon
**Changed Constellations**: Seven star patterns have shifted positions
**Timing**: Changes began during the new moon three weeks ago
**Effects**: Magical spells behaving unpredictably, prophetic dreams increasing
**Scope**: Visible from all depths around Aquabyssos
**Historical Precedent**: Ancient texts mention similar events before major disasters

## Affected Constellations
**The Deep Leviathan**: Ancient sea creature pattern now points toward surface
**The Coral Crown**: Royal symbol constellation dimming significantly
**The Pressure Gate**: Navigation constellation shifted 30 degrees
**The Memory Pearl**: Wisdom constellation flickering intermittently
**The Current Stream**: Flow pattern reversed from traditional direction
**The Guardian Trident**: Protection constellation missing two stars
**The Depth Anchor**: Stability pattern drifting slowly eastward

## Magical Disturbances
- Divination spells providing cryptic or contradictory results
- Teleportation magic occasionally depositing travelers in wrong locations
- Enchanted items experiencing power fluctuations
- Summoning spells calling creatures from unexpected planes
 - Communication magic carrying whispers from unknown sources

## Investigation Leads
**Ancient Observatory**: Abandoned facility with records of previous events
**Star Priests**: Religious order dedicated to celestial observation
**Royal Archives**: Historical documents about constellation significance

## Key NPCs
**Astronomer Sage Stellaris**: Expert in underwater astronomy
**High Priestess Luna**: Leader of the Star Temple
**Ancient Oracle Cosmos**: Mysterious prophet with celestial knowledge
**Library Keeper Scrolls**: Guardian of historical astronomical records
**Foreign Scholar Marina**: Visiting expert on surface world star patterns

## Research Methods
- Comparing current patterns with ancient star charts
- Interviewing elderly citizens about similar past events
- Consulting religious texts and prophecies
- Magical divination focused on celestial influences
- Communication with surface world astronomers

## The Ancient Observatory
**Location**: Highest point in Aquabyssos, partially ruined

**Transformation School**: Major change in world order approaching
**Cycle School**: Natural recurring pattern with no special meaning

## Investigation Challenges
