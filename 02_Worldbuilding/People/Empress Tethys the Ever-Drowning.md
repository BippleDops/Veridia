## Overview
Empress Tethys rules [[Aquabyssos]] through a unique curse/blessing - she drowns to death every dawn and resurrects every dusk, losing and regaining memories in fragments. She is simultaneously the most and least powerful being in the underwater realm, experiencing existence from infinite perspectives.

## The Multiple Tethys Theory
Unknown to most, each death creates a "temporal echo" of Tethys that descends to different depths:
- **Twilight Tethys**: The public face, maintains diplomacy
- **Midnight Tethys**: The true ruler, makes hard decisions
- **Hadean Tethys**: The thing she's becoming, alien and powerful
- **Surface Tethys**: A version that never drowned, exists in dreams

## Current Schemes
1. **The Great Convergence**: Reuniting all versions of herself
2. **The Surface Mirror**: Creating reflection of Aquabyssos above water
3. **The Shard Drowning**: Acquiring one of Aethermoor's [[The Seven Shards]]
4. **The Memory Harvest**: Collecting all drowned memories into herself
5. **The Final Transformation**: Becoming a Thing That Dwells Beneath

## DM Secrets
> [!danger] The Original Tethys
> The "real" Tethys died permanently 400 years ago. What rules now is an amalgamation of the collective unconscious of all who drowned, wearing her form. Each death/resurrection adds more voices to the collective.

> [!warning] The Prophecy
> Tethys has seen a future where she causes the Second Drowning, submerging all worlds. She's desperately trying to prevent this while her other selves work toward it. She is both the problem and solution.

> [!info] The Love That Remains
> Deep in her fractured memories, Tethys retains true love for someone on the surface - possibly an ancestor of someone in Aethermoor. This love is the only thing preventing her from fully embracing the void. If that person's descendant dies or is corrupted, she will lose her last anchor to humanity.
