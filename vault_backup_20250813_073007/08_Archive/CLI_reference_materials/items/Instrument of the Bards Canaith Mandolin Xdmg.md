# Instrument of the Bards, Canaith Mandolin
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/canaith-mandolin.webp#right)


An Instrument of the Bards is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `2d4` Psychic damage.

You can play the Canaith Mandolin to cast one of the following spells: [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/fly-xphb|Fly]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/invisibility-xphb|Invisibility]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/levitate-xphb|Levitate]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good-xphb|Protection from Evil and Good]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/cure-wounds-xphb|Cure Wounds]] (level 3), [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/dispel-magic-xphb|Dispel Magic]], and [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/protection-from-energy-xphb|Protection from Energy]] (Lightning damage only). Once the Canaith Mandolin has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
