--- > [!figure] Portrait # Emperor Thalassius the Deep-Crowned

*The Shadow Emperor, He Who Speaks with Depths, First of the Parliament* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Emperor Thalassius has ruled [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] for over three centuries, though most believe he has only reigned for fifty years. Born during the great submersion of the surface world, he was among the first to successfully bond with shadow essence, allowing him to survive the transformation that created the underwater realm. Now ancient beyond mortal years, he maintains power through a complex web of political manipulation, shadow magic, and genuine care for his transformed people. ## Secrets

> - Is bonded to a shadow that is actually his original surface-world self
> - The "Parliament" often makes decisions he disagrees with - he's not absolute
> - Secretly maintains communication with surface world leaders
> - Knows the locations of three Seven Shards (different ones than Queen Seraphina)
> - His shadow magic is slowly consuming his humanity
> - Has been gradually preparing for succession for decades
