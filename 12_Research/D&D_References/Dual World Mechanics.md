## Summary
Practical, table-ready rules for Dual World Mechanics across Aquabyssos and Aethermoor.

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
