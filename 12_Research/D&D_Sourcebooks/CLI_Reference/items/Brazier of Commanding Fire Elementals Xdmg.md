# Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/brazier-of-commanding-fire-elementals.webp#right)

While you are within 5 feet of this brazier, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to summon a [[elemental]]. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the brazier as possible, understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on your [[Initiative Xphb]] count. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you dismiss it as a [[Action Xphb]]. The brazier can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
