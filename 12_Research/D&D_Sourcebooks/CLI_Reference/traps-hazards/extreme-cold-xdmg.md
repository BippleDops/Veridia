# Extreme Cold
*Environmental Hazard*  

When the temperature is 0 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, a creature exposed to the extreme cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain 1 [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] level. Creatures that have [[resistance-xphb|Resistance]] or [[immunity-xphb|Immunity]] to Cold damage automatically succeed on the save.
