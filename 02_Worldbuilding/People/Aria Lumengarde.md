# Aria Lumengarde
*The Singing Crystal, Voice of the Royal Court, The Secret Revolutionary*

## Overview
Lady Aria Lumengarde, cousin to [[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]], serves as the royal court's premier entertainer and unofficial cultural ambassador. Blessed with an ethereal voice that can literally resonate with crystals, she appears to be the perfect noble daughterâ€”beautiful, talented, and devoted to the crown. In reality, Aria is a master of facades who uses her position and abilities to gather intelligence and subtly undermine the corruption she sees spreading through the nobility.

## Appearance
- **Build**: Elegant and willowy at 5'7", moves with dancer's grace
- **Age**: 26
- **Distinguishing Features**:
  - **Platinum-silver hair** with natural crystal-like highlights
  - **Violet eyes** that shift color when using bardic magic
  - **Crystal resonance marks**: Faint geometric patterns on her throat that glow when singing
  - **Musical scars**: Thin lines on her fingertips from playing crystal instruments
- **Fashion**: Always impeccably dressed in the latest court fashions, favors blues and silvers

## Personality
- **Public Persona**: Charming, witty, seemingly frivolous, devoted to art and beauty
- **Private Truth**: Calculating, passionate about justice, secretly rebellious
- **Values**: Authentic expression, protection of the common people, truth over comfort
- **Fears**: Being discovered, her family being harmed, losing her voice (literally and figuratively)
- **Quirk**: Unconsciously hums when nervous, causing nearby crystals to vibrate softly

## Background
Born to Lord Castellan Lumengarde, the Queen's uncle, Aria grew up in the shadow of the Crystal Spires with all the privileges of royal blood. Her musical talents manifested early, enhanced by her half-elven heritage and an unusual resonance with Aethermoor crystals. While training at the Royal Conservatory, she witnessed the gradual corruption of noble families firsthand. A chance encounter with a dying peasant revolutionary at age 20 opened her eyes to the suffering outside the palace walls, setting her on a secret path of rebellion.
