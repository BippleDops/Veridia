# Well of Many Worlds

## Overview
**Type**: Magic Item

**Group**: *Wondrous item*

**Rarity**: *legendary*


## Description
This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.

You can use an action to unfold and place the *well of many worlds* on a solid surface, whereupon it creates a two-way portal to another world or plane of existence. Each time the item opens a portal, the GM decides where it leads. You can use an action to close an open portal by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Once *well of many worlds* has opened a portal, it canâ€™t do so again for `dice: 1d8`(1d8) hours.
