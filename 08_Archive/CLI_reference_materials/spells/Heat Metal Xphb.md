# Heat Metal
*2nd-level, Transmutation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of iron and a flame)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of Heavy or Medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes `2d8` Fire damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] on each of your later turns to deal this damage again if the object is within range.

If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn't drop the object, it has [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d8` for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes**: [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid|Druid]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-forge-domain-xge "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"|Cleric (Forge Domain)]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Bard (College of Lore)]]
