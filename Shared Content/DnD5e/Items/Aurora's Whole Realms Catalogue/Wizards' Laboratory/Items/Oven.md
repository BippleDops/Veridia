## Description
If heat is the common currency of alchemical research, ovens and kilns are the usurer’s office. Our ovens (60 gp) have a fire-hardened iron shell with a stoking chamber that contains adjustable air intakes and a metal vent that fits nicely through most windows. These ovens achieve heat levels that will melt lead.

Our kilns (120 gp) are large, ceramic-work cylinders heated by a broad coal chamber. Instead of adjustable vents, our kiln coal chamber is fed by four attached [[Bellows|bellows]], set to pumping by the hot air vented through the kiln’s back. With constant stoking, our kilns can reach heat levels that will fire bisque and melt low-grade steel. (Only anthracite coal should be used in our kilns.)

## Additional Details
1 oven and 1 kiln are required for a complete laboratory
