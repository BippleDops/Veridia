A wave of healing energy washes over one creature you can see within range. The target regains all its [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]]. If the creature has the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]], [[conditions#frightened|Frightened]], [[conditions#Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]], or [[conditions#Stunned|Stunned]] condition, the condition ends. If the creature has the [[conditions#prone|Prone]] condition, it can use its [[reaction-xphb|Reaction]] to stand up.
