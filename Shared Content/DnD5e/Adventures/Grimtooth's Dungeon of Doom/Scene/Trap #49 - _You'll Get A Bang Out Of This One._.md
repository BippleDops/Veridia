# Trap #49 - "You'll Get A Bang Out Of This One."
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!HINT]+ Flavor
> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The mere fact that the sand room is now filled with quicksand should only serve to whet the delvers appetite for what is beyond it. There are many ways to get to the hole in the wall that leads on from here. If the delvers are too simple minded, or faint hearted to go on, don't fear others will return who are not.
> 
> Just sit back and watch as they try to get to the 3 foot wide tunnel in the upper comer of the room.
> 
> The tunnel is dark, over 110 feet long, and totally unlighted. The fact that most delvers will have to crawl will serve to block torch light from penetrating to lhe delvers behind the torch bearers. Every few feet the crawling delvers will scuff their knees on an odd curved ridge that seems to circle around the tunnel. This ridge is not too high, and seems to occur at regular intervals. The tomb robber in the lead will be able to see the curving spiral of these lines leading him off into the distance.
> 
> Eventually the leader will find himself at the end of the tube which emerges from a point high on the side wall of a 30 foot by 30 foot room, with a ceiling 12 feet from what seems to be the floor.
> 
> From his vantage point on the wall near the ceiling the lead member of tomb trashers anonymous can see what looks like a featureless room. The walls are white stucco (so what else is new), while the floor and ceiling also seem to be covered with white stucco as well.
> 
> Obviously it is a trap. (Oh my. What a surprise!) The delvers, cramped and confused will now go bats trying to figure out just what sort of trap it is.
> 
> The "floor" is in fact the top of 18 feet of finely milled flour. If the first delver just crawls up and jumps out, he will begin to stir up a fine cloud of flour dust Once even one delver is in the chamber stirring about there will be a 30% chance (L3) of the trap being "activated".
> 
> Professor Grimtooth of the University of Extremely Hard Knocks will now deliver a lecture on explosive clouds of particulate matter. If a sufficent amount of small but even remotely flameable particles go into suspension in common "room" air and a spark (or the flame of a torch) is applied the subsequent ignition will result in an explosion of incredible violence and force! (If you find this hard to believe check out the past history of grain silo, and similar grain storage explosions. This is also the foundation theory behind Fuel/Air aerosol explosives.)
> 
> The more members in the room thrashing about looking for doors and such will drive up the chance of explosion dramatically. (Add 10% (L1) per additional delver per turn, until certainly is reached!)
> 
> The ignition will eventually occur unless the party is possessed with a familiarity with the concept of grain explosions and comes up with another method of "seeing". 
> 
> The force of the explosion will be deadly for whoever is in the room. If the blast doesn't kill the character outright, the lack of Oxygen will. For those still in the tube: The first delver must endure `dice: 400D6` of damage. The next `dice: 200D6`, the next `dice: 100D6`, then `dice: 50D6`, `dice: 25D6`, `dice: 12D6`, `dice: 6D6`, `dice: 3D6`, and finally `dice: 1D6`. Any additional delvers are safe, the force having been expended on each "obstruction" down the line. In addition the force of the blast will throw the occupants back down the tube, literally firing them like soft bullets out of the end of the tunnel. If there are few of them, say 2 or 3, the unabated force will throw them out the end of the tunnel and into the nice soothing quicksand. If they are capable of absorbing the force of the blast(!) this should give them something to think about! 
> 
> To make matters worse, to get through this room the party will have to burrow into the flour! There is a bronze door on the same wall aws the tube's entry hole, the top of which is about 8 feet down. There is a trap door at the tbottom of the far wall, but this is a lot harder to find, although it can be detected by magic. In either event there will have to be much digging and thrashing around, further enhancing the chance of an explosion, or even repeated explosions. (Trap masters don't despair there are magical ways of seeing that recommend themselves. Your victims will come back.)
> 
> This is a four skull trap, almost unavoidable even if the delvers are aware of the way it works, having the exits beneath the level of the flour is the piece-de-resistance. The delvers are truly doomed! But alas, they are also persistent, devious, and infinitely crafty, as a result we must continue on!
