# Black Crystal Tablet
*Wondrous Item, legendary (requires attunement by a creature that has proficiency in the [Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana) skill)*  

- **Properties**: [Requires Attunement](/rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement)
- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

Any creature that attunes to the tablet must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw at the end of its next long rest. On a failed save, the creature becomes afflicted with a random form of long-term madness (see ""Madness"" in chapter 8 of the "Dungeon Master's Guide").

As an action, a creature attuned to the Black Crystal Tablet can use it to cast [eyebite](/compendium/spells/eyebite.md) or [gate](/compendium/spells/gate.md) (the portal created by this spell links to the Far Realm only). After the tablet is used to cast a spell, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
