--- # Polymorph

*4th-level, Transmutation* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour You attempt to transform a creature that you can see within range into a Beast. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or shape-shift into Beast form for the duration. That form can be any Beast you choose that has a [[challenge-rating-xphb (variant-rules) equal to or less than the target's (or the target's level if it doesn't have a [challenge-rating-xphb (variant-rules)]]). The target's game statistics are replaced by the stat block of the chosen Beast, but the target retains its alignment, personality, creature type, [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules), and [hit-point-dice-xphb (variant-rules)]]. The target gains a number of [[temporary-hit-points-xphb (variant-rules) equal to the [hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] of the Beast form. These [[temporary-hit-points-xphb (variant-rules) vanish if any remain when the spell ends. The spell ends early on the target if it has no [temporary-hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] left. The target is limited in the actions it can perform by the anatomy of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells. The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't use or otherwise benefit from any of that equipment. **Classes**: [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 306.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of polymorph xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around polymorph xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## References - [Master_Spell_Compendium]]
