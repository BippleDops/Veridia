# Summon Fiend
*6th-level, Conjuration*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/summon-fiend.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bloody vial worth 600+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a fiendish spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the [[fiendish-spirit-xphb (fiend)]] stat block. When you cast the spell, choose Demon, Devil, or Yugoloth. The creature resembles a Fiend of the chosen type, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your [[Initiative Xphb]] count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [[actions#Dodge|Dodge]] action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.

**Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]
