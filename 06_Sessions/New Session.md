Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## [Lore Details]] Legends speak of [[New Session as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around [New Session]]. ## DM [[Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## [Prophecy Connection]] Mentioned in [[The Hidden Prophecy of Winds ## [Plot Hooks]] - A letter reveals a betrayal about the cult
