# Slow
*3rd-level, Transmutation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of molasses)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a 40-foot [[Cube Area of Effect Xphb]] within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.

An affected target's [[Fly Speed Xphb]] is halved, it takes a -2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can't take Reactions. On its turns, it can take either an action or a [[Action Xphb]], not both, and it can make only one attack if it takes the [[actions#Attack|Attack]] action. If it casts a spell with a Somatic component, there is a  chance the spell fails as a result of the target making the spell's gestures too slowly.

An affected target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on itself on a success.

**Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]

## Player-Facing Summary

Slow xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of slow xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around slow xphb.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
