# White Dragon

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing an adult or ancient white dragon's lair is affected by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Frigid Cold.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is an area of [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/traps-hazards/extreme-cold-xdmg|extreme cold]]. Any water in that area is [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/traps-hazards/frigid-water-xdmg|frigid water]]. See the "Dungeon Master's Guide" for rules on extreme cold and frigid water.  
- **Glacial Gloom.** The area within 1 mile of the lair is [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/lightly-obscured-xphb|Lightly Obscured]] by chilly fog. Whenever a creature other than the dragon or one of its allies finishes a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]] in that area, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have its [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb|Speed]] reduced by 10 feet for 1 hour.  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
