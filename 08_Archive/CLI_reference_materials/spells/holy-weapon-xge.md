# Holy Weapon
*5th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You imbue a weapon you touch with holy power. Until the spell ends, the weapon emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. In addition, weapon attacks made with it deal an extra `2d8` radiant damage on a hit. If the weapon isn't already a magic weapon, it becomes one for the duration.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can dismiss this spell and cause the weapon to emit a burst of radiance. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of the weapon must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `4d8` radiant damage, and it is [blinded](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Blinded) for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't [blinded](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Blinded). At the end of each of its turns, a [blinded](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Blinded) creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Classes**: [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Cleric](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Paladin](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
