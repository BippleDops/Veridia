# Scroll of Titan Summoning (Colossus)
*Scroll, legendary*  



When you take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action to read this scroll, a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/colossus-xmm|Colossus]] appears in an unoccupied space on the ground or in water that you can see within 1 mile of yourself.

The [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/colossus-xmm|Colossus]] is [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hostile-attitude-xphb|Hostile]] toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]]. If the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/colossus-xmm|Colossus]] is summoned into a space that isn't large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted.
