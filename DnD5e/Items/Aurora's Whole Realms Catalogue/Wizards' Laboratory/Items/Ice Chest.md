## Description
Strange though it may seem, some alchemical supplies keep better in cold rather than at common temperature. Our ice chest (35 gp) can hold up to 12 midsize jars standing upright and 2 jars lying on their sides. We also supply ice year-round (1 gp per pound), shipped from Icewind Dale and stored in a cold shed.

## Additional Details
1 ice chest and 20 pounds of ice are needed for a complete laboratory; 20 pounds of ice will keep for 2 months
