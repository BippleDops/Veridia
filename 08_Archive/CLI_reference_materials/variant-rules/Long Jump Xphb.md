# Long Jump
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 370. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

When you make a Long Jump, you leap horizontally a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet immediately before the jump. When you make a standing Long Jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you jump costs a foot of movement.

If you land in [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb|difficult terrain]], you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]) check or have the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Prone|Prone]] condition.

This Long Jump rule assumes that the height of the jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your DM's option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit the obstacle.
