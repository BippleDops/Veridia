# Arcane Study Charm
*Charm*  

After spending a [[long rest xphb|Long Rest]] in your "Bastion", you gain a magical Charm (see ""Supernatural Gifts"" in "chapter 3") that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast [[identify xphb|Identify]] without expending a spell slot or using Material components. You can't gain this Charm again while you still have it.
