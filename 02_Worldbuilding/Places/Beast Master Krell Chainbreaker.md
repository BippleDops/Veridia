## Overview
Krell Chainbreaker is a notorious beast master who operates in the outer districts of Aquabyssos, capturing and training dangerous sea creatures for various illegal purposes. His brutal methods and lack of regard for creature welfare have made him feared throughout the criminal underworld.

Once a legitimate marine biologist, Krell's descent into criminality began after losing his research position due to unethical experimentation. Now he uses his expertise to create living weapons and exotic pets for wealthy clients.

## Statistics
**Medium humanoid (human)**
- **AS** 16 (Studded Leather + Natural Armor), **HP** 78, **Speed** 30 ft, swim 40 ft
- **STR** 16 **DEX** 14 **CON** 15 **INT** 17 **WIS** 13 **CHA** 12
- **Skills** Animal Handling +8, Survival +6, Medicine +6, Arcana +7
- **Damage Resistances** Cold, Poison
- **Senses** Darkvision 60 ft
- **CR** 7

### Actions
**Multiattack.** Makes two attacks: one with his shock spear, one command creature.
**Shock Spear.** +7 to hit, reach 10 ft, 1d8+3 piercing + 1d6 lightning damage.
**Command Creature.** Commands one tamed beast to attack (beast acts immediately).
**Beast Whistle** (Recharge 5-6). Summons 1d4 trained sea creatures to aid him.

## Background
Formerly Dr. Krell Marineson, he was expelled from the Aquabyssos Research Institute for conducting illegal experiments on sentient sea life. His obsession with creature control led him to develop brutal training methods that break creatures' wills entirely.

Now he operates from hidden facilities in abandoned kelp farms, where the screams of tortured creatures echo through the water. His client list includes assassins, gladiator promoters, and wealthy collectors who want "unique" pets.

## Beast Companions
**Frenzy** (Dire Shark): His primary enforcer and mount
**The Twins** (Modified Electric Eels): Shock weapons and guards
**Whisper** (Telepathic Octopus): Spy and communication relay
**Pack**: 3-6 various trained sea creatures depending on current jobs

## Quest Hooks
1. Players hired to rescue captured companion/mount
2. Investigation into missing creatures leads to his facilities
3. He approaches party with offer for rare creature acquisition
4. His escaped experiments threaten local areas

### Key Locations
1. Main entrance/approach
2. Central gathering area
3. Important buildings/features
4. Defensive positions (if applicable)
5. Hidden or secret areas

## DM Notes
Krell should be portrayed as intelligent but completely amoral. His facilities are horrifying but he sees himself as a scientist. Use him to explore themes of abuse of power and scientific ethics.
