--- # Gnome (Deep)

*Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 113* - **Ability Scores**: dex +1
- **Size**: Small
- **Speed**: 25 ft. ### Age Deep gnomes are short-lived for gnomes. They mature at the same rate humans do and are considered full-grown adults by 25. They live 200 to 250 years, although hard toil and the dangers of the Underdark often claim them before their time. ### Size Unlike other gnomes, svirfneblin tend to weigh 80 to 120 pounds. Your size is Small. ### Superior Darkvision Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. ### Gnome Cunning You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic. ### Languages You can speak, read, and write Common, Gnomish, and Undercommon. ### Alignment Svirfneblin believe that survival depends on avoiding entanglements with other creatures and not making enemies, so they favor neutral alignments. They rarely wish others ill, and they are unlikely to take risks on behalf of others, except those dearest to them. ### Stone Camouflage You have advantage on Dexterity ([[skills#Stealth|Stealth]]) checks to hide in rocky terrain. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Gnome deep mtf is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of gnome deep mtf as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around gnome deep mtf. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Covenant - Control trade routes ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
