# Rainshield (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *cantrip*

**School**: *Abjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 hour


## Effects
You create an invisible, slightly convex barrier about three feet in diameter to appear no higher than five feet above your head. This protects you from normal rainfall and light hail, but not from magical non-water-based rains. It will protect you from other sorts of falling liquids.

With concentration, you may angle the rainshield to help protect you from wind-blown rain.
