## Description
Gorilla bears are the result of the same, or similar, magical crossbreeding that created the owlbear. In this case, the creatures merged were an ape (not necessarily a gorilla, despite the name) and a black bear. The resulting creature is smaller than an owlbear, but somewhat more intelligent.

A gorilla bear’s fur ranges in color from jet black to brownish-black. Older creatures have a distinct stripe of gray fur running down their backs. Their forepaws and hind feet end in bear claws, not a gorilla’s nails. On its hind feet, a typical gorilla bear stands 8 feet tall, but they spend most of the their time on all fours.

Legends speak of an immensely powerful, whitefurred gorilla bear with eyes the color of amethysts, but such a pelt has never been sold or displayed in any civilized land.

Gorilla bears make their lairs in caves hidden among the twisted tangle of trees and shrubs. A typical lair contains a single adult male, one to three adult females, and one to four young. Many adult males live alone. Gorilla bears are daylight hunters with a stronger taste for fresh meat than either bears or gorillas. They’ve been known to actually trail and hunt both goblins and elves, presumably because they enjoy the taste of those creatures’ flesh more than any other.

Gorilla bears are highly aggressive. They seldom retreat from a fight, but they have been known to flee from fiery magic. Escaping from a pack of attacking gorilla bears is next to impossible, given their great speed both on the ground and through the treetops. If a gorilla bear gets both paws onto a foe, it’s capable of delivering a crushing hug, but they always release the victim almost immediately to resume slashing with their claws.
