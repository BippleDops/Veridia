## Description
This new product comes from the ingenious craftsmen of the Shining South. A tapered piece of leather contains pockets that hold specially ground pieces of glass. When removed from their pockets, fitted in the clips at the ends of the leather, and encased by the buttoned leather roll, these pieces of glass work an odd magic: they make distant things appear close, and close things appear blurry. Though this oddity might seem useless at first glance, imagine the application on the battlefield or when spying on an enemy camp. (25 gp).

## Additional Details
doubles the range and detail-level of normal vision (see “Vision and Light” in the PHB)
