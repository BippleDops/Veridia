## Special Traits
**Innocent Appearance:** A patch of flowershroud looks completely natural to the untrained eye. They always have tactical advantage on Stealth checks, and their Stealth is opposed by the observer's Nature skill, not Perception.

**Shroudblossom Poison:** A character who fails a DC 11 Constitution saving throw when struck by a flowershroud's thorn strand attack falls prone and goes into convulsions lasting `dice: 1d6` rounds unless the poison effect is ended early with magic. During that time, the character can't stand up or move, is incapacitated, and takes 2 (`dice: 1d4`) poison damage at the start of each of its turns.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A flowershroud attacks three times with thorn strands.

**Thorn Strand:** *Melee Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 4 (`dice: 1d6+1`) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be affected by shroudblossom poison (see above).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate and warm forest and prairie

**Organization**: Solitary or patch (2–9)

## Description
A flowershroud is a flowering plant that spreads across the ground and most other surfaces the same as any creeping plant. Its roots are extremely shallow, however, and it can pull them out of the ground in only a few seconds, then use them like tiny legs to literally creep across the ground and any other surface that a plant can cling to. They infest pleasant forest glades but also grow along game trails, where movement off the trail is difficult. They move so slowly that most animals can escape from the danger by simply walking away, but their tendrils can lash out to a surprising distance. Unlike adventurers traveling through the wilderness, flowershrouds never need to stop for rest. They present their greatest danger at night, when travelers have made camp and gone to sleep. Then, flowershrouds can creep into a campsite to attack sleeping prey.
