## Effects
You deliver a blasting rebuke to your foes. The creature must make a Wisdom sav- ing roll or suffer an effect, depending on its alignment:

♦ If the creature’s alignment differs from yours on one axis (lawful-chaotic, etc.), it takes 1d10 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a success-ful one.

♦ If the creature’s alignment differs from you on both axes, it takes 3d10 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one.
