## Lore Details

Legends speak of Dr. Coral Soulseeker as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Dr. Coral Soulseeker.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Dr. Coral Soulseeker to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
