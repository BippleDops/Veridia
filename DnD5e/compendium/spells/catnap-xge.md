# Catnap
*3rd-level, Enchantment*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** S, a pinch of sand
- **Duration:** 10 minute

You make a calming gesture, and up to three willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range fall [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for the spell's duration. The spell ends on a target early if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake. If a target remains [unconscious](/rules/conditions.md#unconscious) for the full duration, that target gains the benefit of a short rest, and it can't be affected by this spell again until it finishes a long rest.

**Classes**: Artificer, Artificer (Revisited), Bard, Rogue (Arcane Trickster), Sorcerer, Wizard
