## Overview
The Shadow Binding Sanctum is a hidden facility where practitioners of shadow magic conduct dangerous experiments in binding and controlling shadow entities. Located in the deepest, darkest trenches beneath Aquabyssos, this sanctum serves as both research center and prison for captured shadow creatures. The facility exists in a perpetual state of twilight, where darkness is not merely the absence of light but a living, manipulable substance.

Built within a natural cave system that extends far below the city proper, the sanctum takes advantage of the area's natural isolation from light sources. The chambers have been extensively modified with magical enhancements that allow precise control over shadow density and behavior.
