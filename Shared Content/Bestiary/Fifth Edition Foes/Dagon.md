## Special Traits

**Deadly Critical:** Dagon scores a critical hit whenever its attack roll is a natural 19 or 20. A creature struck by a critical hit from Dagon is also poisoned for one minute and must make a successful DC 20 Constitution saving throw or immediately begin drowning. This affects all creatures, even those that can ordinarily breathe underwater or are benefiting from a water breathing spell or similar magic. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns; drowning ceases with a successful save. Drowning continues until a successful save is made, the target dies, or the effect is dispelled as a 7th-level spell. A successful saving throw does not make the target immune to this effect from another critical hit.

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day):** Dagon can opt to automatically succeed on a saving throw it just failed.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** Dagon can use the following spell-like abilities, using Charisma as its casting ability (DC 18, attack +10). Dagon doesn’t need material components to use these abilities.

- Constant: *speak with animals (aquatic animals only)*

- At will: *cloudkill (works underwater only), dominate monster, darkness, detect evil and good, detect magic, detect thoughts, dispel magic, fear, magic missile (6 missiles), teleport, telekinesis, tongues, water breathing 3/day: blur, conjure elemental (water only), enhance ability*

- 1/day: *confusion, feeblemind, finger of death, hold person, hold monster, lightning bolt, stoneskin, time stop, web, wish*

**Unholy Aura:** An unholy aura surrounds Dagon to a radius of 40 feet. All creatures must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw with the effects shown below. Evil creatures have tactical advantage on the saving throw. (Most evil creatures know better than to approach within 40 feet of Dagon.)

| **Level or CR** | **Successful Save** | **Failed Save** |
|---|---|---|
| 25 | No ill effect | Stunned 1 round |
| 21-24 | Frightened `dice: 1d4` rounds | Stunned 1 round, then frightened `dice: 2d4` rounds |
| 16-20 | Paralyzed `dice: 1d6` rounds, then frightened `dice: 1d4` rounds | Paralyzed `dice: 1d10` minutes, then frightened `dice: 2d4` rounds |
| 0-15 | Paralyzed `dice: 1d10` minutes, then frightened `dice: 2d4` rounds | Instant death |

**Water Mastery:** Dagon always has tactical advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws when he is even partly in sea water.

## Description

Dagon is the [[Thalasskoptis, Demon Prince|demon prince]] of sea creatures. He is worshipped as a deity by legions of sahuagin, locathah, lizardfolk, tritons (those that have accepted the ways of evil), and some merfolk. His Abyssal lair resembles the Elemental Plane of Water in that it is composed entirely of water. Pockets of air are rumored to be trapped in invisible bubbles throughout his lair to allow non-water breathing demons to exist comfortably. His home is a great underwater citadel made of rusting iron and sunken ships called Thos, located at unimaginable, crushing depth in a near-bottomless trench of his home plane.

Dagon appears as a 10-foot tall merman weighing 2,000 pounds. He can move on land using his fists to drag or pull his body, but prefers to remain in water whenever possible. One of his favorite “pranks” is grabbing an air-breathing opponent and diving as deep as he can in the sea, until the unbearable pressure collapses the victim’s lungs and it drowns.

Followers of Dagon are mermen, locathah, sahuagin, lizardfolk— any evil humanoids that revere the seas and oceans. Devout followers of Dagon are called scaled ones. Many of them sign a pact of evil with Dagon, which gives them the ability to breathe underwater and a swim speed of 20 ft. (unless they naturally have a swim speed faster than that). Over time, they develop physical similarities to the most alien, frightening creatures of the mysterious deeps, until eventually they can no longer pass even as freakish members of their original race.
