# Session 3: Underwater Chase
*The Sunken Conspiracy - Pursuing Suspects Through Pressure Tubes*

## Session Overview

**Expected Duration**: 4-5 hours  
**Party Level**: 2nd-3rd level  
**Adventure Type**: Action-Adventure, Chase Sequence, Environmental Challenges  
**Key Themes**: High-stakes pursuit, pressure mechanics, split-second decisions, environmental dangers

### Session Goals
- Execute a thrilling underwater chase through Port Meridian's infrastructure
- Demonstrate the unique challenges of the underwater environment
- Escalate the stakes with immediate threats to Parliament
- Provide opportunities for creative problem-solving under pressure
- Set up the infiltration of the main smuggler base
- Show consequences of player choices from previous sessions

## Opening: The Race Against Time

### Immediate Crisis

Continuing directly from Session 2's cliffhanger:

> Luna Freedrift's voice crackles through the communication crystal with urgency that cuts through the water like a blade: "The Parliament complex is under attack! Modified vessels are approaching through the Deep Channel—they'll reach the main chambers in less than twenty minutes. Whatever you discovered out there, they're moving faster than we expected."

**The Situation**:
- **Parliament Session**: Emergency meeting is in progress with most leadership present
- **Attack Fleet**: 4 modified vessels approaching through underwater channels
- **Time Pressure**: 20 minutes until vessels reach Parliament chambers
- **Party Location**: Deep Current base (15 minutes from Port Meridian by fastest route)
- **Options**: Multiple paths back to the city, each with different risks and benefits

### Critical Decision Point

**The party must choose their approach**:

1. **Direct Pressure Tube Route**: Fastest path, highest pressure, most dangerous
2. **Harbor Channel Route**: Moderate speed, potential for interception, safer  
3. **Split the Party**: Some take each route for maximum coverage
4. **Alert Only**: Send warning and continue investigating the base
5. **Sabotage First**: Try to disable some attack vessels before leaving

**Consequences of Each Choice**:
- **Direct Route**: Arrive first but potentially exhausted/damaged
- **Harbor Route**: Arrive during the attack with full capabilities
- **Split Party**: Maximum information but divided resources  
- **Alert Only**: Parliament defense improved but party not present for action
- **Sabotage**: May reduce attack effectiveness but definitely arrive late

## Scene 1: The Pressure Tube Network

### System Overview

Port Meridian's pressure tube network is a marvel of underwater engineering—a system of crystalline tubes that allow rapid transit through the city by manipulating water pressure and current flow.

**Pressure Tube Mechanics**:
- **Speed**: Travel at 60 mph through guided pressure differentials
- **Navigation**: Automated systems with manual override capability
- **Pressure**: Rapid changes require Constitution saves or suffer effects
- **Capacity**: Standard tubes hold 4 medium creatures, express tubes hold 8
- **Power**: Crystal-powered systems can be overloaded for extra speed

### Entering the Network

**Pressure Tube Terminal Alpha-7** (Deep Current access point):

> The terminal appears abandoned, its bioluminescent guide lights flickering irregularly. Emergency access panels glow red, indicating system overrides are in effect. Through the crystalline viewing ports, you can see the main pressure tube—a translucent tunnel filled with swirling water that seems to pulse with its own heartbeat.

**Terminal Status** (Investigation DC 15):
- System shows unusual modifications to routing protocols
- Multiple unauthorized access codes have been used recently  
- Emergency lockouts have been disabled
- Tracking systems are recording false data

**Getting Access**:
- **Official Authority**: Automatic access with Parliamentary credentials
- **Underground Contacts**: Agent Whisper provides override codes (if that path was chosen)
- **Technical Skills**: Thieves' Tools DC 18 to hack the system
- **Brute Force**: Strength DC 20 to force emergency access (triggers alarms)

### The Chase Begins

**Enemy Forces in Pursuit**:
As the party enters the pressure tube system, they discover they're not alone.

**Pursuing Vessels**:
- **Modified Submersible "Depth Stalker"**: Fast attack craft with **Commodore Shadowfin** aboard
- **2 Pressure Riders**: Single-person pursuit vehicles with **Modified Crew Members**
- **Pursuit Duration**: Entire journey back to Port Meridian (15-20 minutes of game time)

**The Hunt**:
> As your transport pod accelerates into the pressure tube network, proximity alarms blare. Through the rear viewport, you see sleek shapes cutting through the water behind you—pursuit craft that move with predatory grace. The lead vessel's hull gleams with the same metallic modifications you saw at the base, and through its transparent canopy, you glimpse the scarred face of Commodore Marcus Shadowfin.

## Scene 2: Chase Through the Network

### The Three-Stage Chase

The chase is divided into three distinct stages, each with different challenges and opportunities.

#### Stage 1: The Deep Tubes (Minutes 1-7)

**Environment**: High-pressure tubes at 2,000+ feet depth, narrow passages, minimal branching.

**Challenges**:
- **Extreme Pressure**: Constitution saves DC 16 every 2 minutes or gain exhaustion
- **Narrow Confines**: Disadvantage on Dexterity saves, limited movement
- **System Instability**: Modified routing causes unpredictable pressure changes

**Chase Mechanics**:
- **Distance**: Pursuers start 300 feet behind, gaining 50 feet per round
- **Speed Control**: Characters can attempt to modify pod speed
- **Evasion**: Limited opportunities due to narrow tubes
- **Combat**: Ranged attacks only, with disadvantage due to movement and pressure

**Key Events**:

**Event 1: Pressure Wave Attack** (Round 3)
> Shadowfin's vessel fires some kind of sonic weapon that sends a pressure wave through the tube. The crystalline walls crack, and your pod shudders as the tube begins to collapse behind you.

**Mechanics**: 
- Dexterity save DC 17 or pod takes 2d6 damage and speed reduced by half
- Tube section collapses, blocking pursuit temporarily
- Party gains 2 rounds before pursuers find alternate route

**Event 2: System Override** (Round 5)  
> Warning lights flash as the tube system attempts to divert you into a maintenance cylinder—a dead end that would trap you for manual "processing."

**Options**:
- **Technical Challenge**: Investigation DC 18 to override the diversion
- **Manual Control**: Pilot the pod manually (Vehicles/Water DC 16)
- **Brace for Impact**: Accept diversion but prepare for consequences
- **Emergency Exit**: Attempt to leave the tube system early (dangerous)

#### Stage 2: The Junction Maze (Minutes 8-14)

**Environment**: Complex intersection area with multiple tubes, switching stations, and maintenance areas.

**New Opportunities**:
- **Multiple Paths**: Choice of routes affects arrival time and pursuit difficulty
- **Obstacles**: Use switching mechanisms and maintenance systems against pursuers
- **Allies**: Potential help from Luna's people operating in the area
- **Equipment**: Access to pressure suits and emergency gear at stations

**Junction Map** (describe key decision points):
- **North Route**: Fast but passes through Parliament's defense perimeter
- **South Route**: Slower but has opportunities to lose pursuit  
- **Central Route**: Medium speed, passes through civilian areas
- **Maintenance Tunnels**: Slowest but most opportunities for ambush/sabotage

**Chase Intensification**:
- **Additional Pursuers**: 2 more Pressure Riders join from side tubes
- **Civilian Traffic**: Must avoid causing casualties to innocent tube users
- **System Damage**: Chase is damaging the tube infrastructure
- **Time Pressure**: Parliament attack is proceeding regardless of chase

**Key Events**:

**Event 3: The Junction Battle** (Rounds 8-10)
> In the vast spherical chamber of Central Junction, multiple tubes converge like arteries meeting at a heart. Your pod slows as the automated systems cycle through routing protocols, giving your pursuers time to close distance. Through the transparent walls, you see the sleek forms of pursuit craft surrounding you from multiple angles.

**Combat Encounter**: Three-dimensional battle in zero-gravity water environment.

**Enemies**:
- **Commodore Marcus Shadowfin** (in command submersible):
  - Use Veteran stats with additional modifications
  - Vehicle provides +2 AC and resistance to piercing damage
  - Armed with pressure weapons and boarding cables

- **4 Modified Crew Members** (in Pressure Riders):
  - Use Bandit stats with underwater equipment
  - Single-person attack craft with built-in weapons
  - Tactics focus on disabling party's vehicle, not killing

**Environmental Factors**:
- **Zero Gravity**: Movement in all directions, no "up" or "down"
- **Pressure Fields**: Areas of different pressure affect movement and combat
- **Junction Traffic**: Civilian pods create obstacles and moral complications
- **System Controls**: Can be used to redirect tubes, create barriers, or cause distractions

**Tactical Options**:
- **Direct Combat**: Fight the enemies head-on
- **Evasion**: Use civilian traffic and tube systems for cover
- **Sabotage**: Damage junction systems to slow pursuit
- **Negotiation**: Attempt to communicate with Shadowfin (difficult but possible)

**Event 4: Civilian Complications** (Round 12)
> A civilian transport pod, carrying what appears to be a family with young children, suddenly appears in your path as you flee through the tube system. Behind you, the pursuers close in, weapons charging for another attack.

**Moral Choice**: How does the party handle innocent bystanders?
- **Protect Civilians**: Use your pod to shield them (risk damage, gain moral benefit)
- **Warning Only**: Try to warn them and continue (moderate risk, neutral)
- **Use as Cover**: Hide behind civilian pod (low risk, moral consequences)
- **Ignore Them**: Focus only on escape (no risk, but civilians endangered)

**Consequences**:
- **Protection**: Civilians remember, may help later; party takes extra damage
- **Warning**: 50% chance civilians escape safely
- **Using Cover**: Civilians definitely endangered, reputation damage if discovered
- **Ignoring**: Civilians definitely in danger, potential casualties

#### Stage 3: The Final Stretch (Minutes 15-20)

**Environment**: Direct tubes leading to Parliament complex, high security, maximum pressure.

**New Challenges**:
- **Defense Systems**: Parliament's automated defenses may target all approaching vessels
- **Maximum Pressure**: 3,000+ feet depth, extreme environmental stress
- **Time Critical**: Attack on Parliament is beginning as party approaches
- **System Failure**: Tube network showing signs of critical damage from chase

**The Parliament Defense Perimeter**:
> As you approach the Parliament complex, the water around you suddenly fills with the silhouettes of defensive constructs—crystalline guardians that pulse with magical energy. Warning signals flash: "Approaching vessels, identify yourselves or be destroyed. Parliament complex is under emergency lockdown."

**Defense Challenge**:
- **Identification**: Must prove party is authorized (varies based on previous choices)
- **Navigation**: Automated defenses create maze of energy barriers
- **Communication**: Contact Luna or other allies to gain safe passage
- **Stealth**: Try to slip through defenses without being detected

**Final Confrontation in the Tubes**:
> In the last stretch before Parliament, Commodore Shadowfin's vessel catches up completely. Through the communication system, his bitter voice echoes: "You don't understand what you're interfering with. The Parliament's weakness will destroy everything we've built. This is the only way to save Aquabyssos from itself!"

**Shadowfin's Desperation**: Final chance for negotiation or combat.
- **Persuasion DC 20**: Convince him the surface agents are manipulating him
- **Intimidation DC 18**: Force him to back down through threats
- **Deception DC 22**: Make him believe the party works for his surface contacts
- **Combat**: Final vehicle battle in highest-pressure environment

## Scene 3: Arrival at Parliament

### The Battle in Progress

**Time of Arrival**: Depends on route chosen and success in chase.
- **Early Arrival** (Direct route, successful): Before attack begins, can organize defense
- **Timely Arrival** (Harbor route, moderate success): During opening attack, join ongoing battle
- **Late Arrival** (Delays, failed checks): Attack in progress, Parliament in serious danger

**The Parliament Complex Under Attack**:
> The magnificent Parliament complex, normally a beacon of bioluminescent beauty in the depths, is now a war zone. Modified vessels circle like predators, their weapons sending destructive pulses through the water. The crystal spires that house the legislative chambers show cracks, and emergency lighting casts everything in harsh red tones.

### The Attack Pattern

**Enemy Forces**:
- **4 Modified Vessels** (the stolen ships, now weaponized):
  - *Coral Current*: Armed with sonic disruptors
  - *Deep Fortune*: Equipped with boarding pods
  - *Meridian's Pride*: Communication jamming and command coordination
  - *Golden Current*: Heavy assault platform with siege weapons

**Attack Objectives**:
1. **Neutralize Defenses**: Disable Parliament's protective systems
2. **Deploy Boarding Parties**: Insert controlled crews into the building
3. **Capture Leadership**: Take key Parliament members alive
4. **Install New Government**: Senator Darkwater leads "emergency" takeover

**Parliamentary Defenses**:
- **Crystal Guardians**: Magical constructs protecting the complex
- **Deep Guard**: Elite Parliamentary security forces  
- **Emergency Barriers**: Magical shields protecting critical areas
- **Loyalist Forces**: Admiral Blackwater's naval units (may be delayed)

### Multi-Front Battle

**The party faces multiple simultaneous challenges**:

#### Combat Front: Engaging the Attack Fleet

**Vehicle Combat Options**:
- **Commandeer Defenses**: Take control of Parliamentary defense systems
- **Naval Support**: Coordinate with arriving loyalist forces
- **Boarding Actions**: Direct assault on the modified vessels
- **Sabotage**: Infiltrate and disable vessels from within

**Modified Vessel Combat Stats**:
Each vessel uses Ship stat blocks with these modifications:
- **Coral Current** (Sonic Disruptor Ship):
  - AC 17, HP 300
  - **Sonic Pulse**: 60 ft cone, 4d6 thunder damage, Dex save DC 16
  - **Crew**: 12 controlled individuals (use Bandit stats)

- **Deep Fortune** (Boarding Platform):
  - AC 16, HP 250  
  - **Boarding Pods**: Deploys 6 pods with 3 crew each
  - **Grappling Systems**: Can restrain other vessels
  - **Crew**: 18 controlled individuals

#### Infiltration Front: Parliament Building Interior

**If the party chooses to enter the Parliament building**:

**Interior Challenges**:
- **Flooded Sections**: Parts of building breached, underwater navigation required
- **Controlled Infiltrators**: Boarding parties with mind-controlled crews
- **Panicked Legislators**: Civilians who need protection and evacuation
- **Security Systems**: Some helpful, some compromised by the conspiracy

**Key Locations Inside Parliament**:

**The Speaker's Chamber**:
> Water swirls ankle-deep across the ancient coral floor as emergency lighting casts writhing shadows on the walls. Legislative benches, carved from single massive shells, are overturned and scattered. In the center, a group of Parliament members huddle around Speaker Coralia Deepsong, who maintains a magical barrier against the flooding.

**The Crystal Archive**:
> The repository of Parliament's memory crystals is under direct assault. Controlled boarding crews are systematically destroying centuries of legislative history while downloading select files to portable storage devices.

**The Emergency Command Center**:
> Admiral Blackwater coordinates the defense from this heavily shielded chamber, but communication arrays are damaged and several staff positions show signs of violent struggle.

#### Social Front: The Political Crisis

**Amidst the combat, political maneuvering continues**:

**Senator Darkwater's Gambit**:
> Even as the battle rages, Senator Octavius Darkwater moves through the Parliament building with a small guard, presenting himself as the strong leader needed in this crisis. His message is simple: "The current leadership's weakness invited this attack. Give me emergency authority, and I'll end this threat."

**Key Political Targets**:
- **Speaker Coralia Deepsong**: Must be protected or rescued
- **Defense Committee**: Several members may support or oppose Darkwater
- **Foreign Ambassadors**: Their safety affects diplomatic relations
- **Admiral Blackwater**: Military leader whose loyalty is crucial

**Political Skill Challenges**:
- **Expose Darkwater**: Reveal his connection to the conspiracy (DC 18 Persuasion/Evidence)
- **Rally Loyalists**: Organize effective resistance to takeover (DC 16 Leadership)
- **Protect Evidence**: Ensure proof of conspiracy isn't destroyed (DC 15 Investigation)
- **Coordinate Defense**: Unify military response (DC 17 Tactics)

## Scene 4: Critical Moments

### The Modified Crew Revelation

**During the battle, the party gets close enough to examine the enemy crews**:

> As you board the *Deep Fortune*, expecting to face hostile smugglers, you instead find something far more disturbing. The crew members move in perfect synchronization, their eyes reflecting a dull, artificial light. When you strike one down, instead of blood, a silvery substance leaks from the wound. These aren't just controlled—they've been fundamentally altered.

**The Truth About the Crews**:
- **Memory Modification**: Original personalities have been overwritten
- **Physical Enhancement**: Bodies modified for peak performance and compliance
- **Neural Implants**: Artificial control systems grafted into their brains
- **Fail-Safes**: Will self-destruct rather than be captured alive

**Moral Implications**:
- **Are They Still Human?**: Philosophy about identity and free will
- **Can They Be Saved?**: Medical/magical intervention might be possible
- **Combat Ethics**: Is it murder to fight them, or mercy?
- **Time Constraints**: No opportunity for lengthy moral debates during battle

### The Surface Agent's Reveal

**At the climax of the battle, the mysterious surface agent from the Deep Current base arrives**:

**Agent Tempest** (use Enhanced Spy stats):
- **Race**: Human (heavily modified with mechanical augmentations)
- **Equipment**: Advanced power armor adapted for underwater use
- **Abilities**: Technology that seems almost alien to Aquabyssos society
- **Goals**: Ensure mutual destruction between Parliament factions

**Tempest's Entrance**:
> From the deepest waters, a figure rises that belongs to neither world. The power armor it wears gleams with impossible geometries, and the water around it seems to bend in ways that hurt to watch. When it speaks, its voice carries both human inflection and mechanical precision: "Both sides disappoint me. Aquabyssos politics are as weak as surface diplomacy. Let me demonstrate true power."

**Agent Tempest's Abilities**:
- **Pressure Immunity**: Unaffected by any pressure-based attacks or environment
- **Advanced Weaponry**: Technology beyond current Aquabyssos capabilities
- **Reality Distortion**: Minor ability to alter local physics
- **Tactical Superiority**: Access to real-time intelligence on all forces

### The Flood Weapon

**Agent Tempest's ultimate gambit**:

> "If neither faction is strong enough to rule, then neither deserves to survive. The surface world can find more... manageable partners in the ruins."

**The Weapon**: A device that rapidly alters water pressure in a massive area.
- **Area of Effect**: Entire Parliament complex and surrounding districts
- **Effect**: Crushing pressure that will kill anyone not heavily adapted
- **Duration**: Permanent unless device is destroyed
- **Activation**: 3 rounds after Agent Tempest begins the process

**Stopping the Flood Weapon** (Multi-Part Challenge):

**Phase 1: Reach the Device** (Action Scene)
- Navigate through ongoing battle and flooding
- Overcome Agent Tempest's defenses
- Coordinate with allies to create opening

**Phase 2: Disable the Technology** (Skill Challenge)
- **Investigation DC 20**: Understand the device's function
- **Arcana DC 18**: Identify magical components
- **Thieves' Tools DC 22**: Safely disable without triggering fail-safes
- **3 successes before 2 failures, each attempt takes 1 round**

**Phase 3: Deal with Agent Tempest** (Combat/Social)
- **Combat Option**: Fight the enhanced agent directly
- **Persuasion Option**: Convince them their surface masters are betraying them
- **Deception Option**: Pretend to serve the same surface organization
- **Destruction Option**: Destroy the device even if it means collateral damage

## Scene 5: Resolution and Aftermath

### Victory Conditions

The session can end with various degrees of success:

#### Complete Victory
- Agent Tempest defeated or convinced to stand down
- Flood weapon disabled safely
- Parliament leadership saved
- Senator Darkwater's conspiracy exposed
- Modified crews somehow freed or mercifully dispatched

#### Partial Victory  
- Major threats neutralized but some goals unmet
- Parliament saved but political chaos ensues
- Some evidence of conspiracy remains hidden
- Agent Tempest escapes with dangerous knowledge
- Modified crews' fate remains unresolved

#### Pyrrhic Victory
- Immediate threats stopped but at high cost
- Significant casualties among Parliament members
- Political system destabilized
- Agent Tempest's warnings about surface world prove accurate
- Party must deal with moral compromises made during crisis

### Immediate Consequences

**Political Aftermath**:
- **Emergency Government**: Temporary leadership needed while Parliament recovers
- **Investigation Commissions**: Official inquiry into the conspiracy
- **Diplomatic Crisis**: Relations with surface world severely strained
- **Military Response**: Admiral Blackwater's forces on high alert

**Personal Consequences for Party**:
- **Heroes of Parliament**: Public recognition and rewards
- **Political Targets**: Conspiracy remnants may seek revenge
- **Moral Burdens**: Decisions made under pressure have lasting effects
- **New Allies**: Relationships formed during crisis

### Setting Up Session 4

**The Deeper Mystery Revealed**:
> As the immediate crisis passes, a disturbing pattern emerges from the evidence. Agent Tempest's technology, the modified crews, the precision of the attack—it all points to a level of preparation that suggests this conspiracy reaches far deeper than anyone imagined. In the Parliament archives, a partially destroyed memory crystal reveals coordinates to a location that shouldn't exist: a facility that predates the current Parliament, hidden in the deepest trenches where pressure should make life impossible.

**New Hooks for Next Session**:
1. **The Ancient Facility**: Pre-Parliament technology cache discovered
2. **Surface World Tensions**: Diplomatic crisis requires investigation
3. **Conspiracy Survivors**: Remaining cells must be found and neutralized
4. **Modified Crew Rehabilitation**: Attempt to restore their humanity
5. **Agent Tempest's Warnings**: Possible larger threats approaching

**Cliffhanger**:
> Among Agent Tempest's equipment, you find a communication device still active with an incoming message: "Operation Deep Liberation has failed. Initiate Protocol Seven. Surface Fleet Alpha is authorized to proceed with full invasion. Aquabyssos will submit, or Aquabyssos will drown."

### Handout 8: Agent Tempest's Communication Log
```
[DECODED TRANSMISSION - ULTRA CLASSIFIED]

From: Surface Command Authority
To: Agent Tempest [Deep Insertion Team]
Re: Operation status update

Phase 3 objectives partially completed. Local assets have 
successfully destabilized parliamentary structure, but primary 
targets remain secured. Recommend immediate escalation to 
Protocol Seven.

Intelligence indicates local investigation team has discovered 
Deep Current facility. This compromises long-term operations 
and threatens exposure of surface involvement.

Authorization granted for tactical demonstration of superior 
technology. Show them what real power looks like, then offer 
them the choice: submit or face full invasion fleet.

The surface world is done negotiating with underwater 
primitives. One way or another, Aquabyssos will serve 
surface interests.

Await further instructions after demonstration.
