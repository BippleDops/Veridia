- "desc": "The remorhaz makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature\
    \ it is grappling. If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite's damage and\
    \ is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is [blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#blinded)\
    \ and [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained), it has total\
    \ cover against attacks and other effects outside the remorhaz, and it takes dice:6d6|text(21)\
    \ (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the remorhaz's turns.\n\nIf the\
    \ remorhaz takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it,\
    \ the remorhaz must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of\
    \ that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone)\
    \ in a space within 10 feet of the remorhaz. If the remorhaz dies, a swallowed\
    \ creature is no longer [restrained](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#restrained)\
    \ by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting [prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/rules/conditions.md#prone)."
