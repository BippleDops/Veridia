--- # Rockslide

*Generic Hazard* When a rockslide occurs, every creature in its path makes a **DC 15** Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 11 (``dice: 2d10``) Bludgeoning damage, has the [[conditions#prone|Prone condition, and moves with the rockslide. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. When the rockslide stops, its space becomes [Difficult Terrain Xphb]], and all Prone creatures in its space are buried under rocks and debris. A creature buried in this way has the [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained condition and has [Cover Xphb]]. As an action, a creature can try to crawl out from under the rock pile. If the creature succeeds on a **DC 15** Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics) check, it is no longer Restrained; instead, it has the [conditions#prone|Prone]] condition and is atop the rock pile. If the check fails, the creature remains buried and gains 1 [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] level. A creature that has neither the Incapacitated nor the Restrained condition can spend 1 minute freeing another creature buried by the rockslide. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## At Higher Levels You can scale this hazard for higher levels by increasing the Bludgeoning damage as follows: 22 (``dice: 4d10``) at levels 5â€“10, 55 (``dice: 10d10``) at levels 11â€“16, and 99 (``dice: 18d10``) at levels 17â€“20. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 78* ## Player-Facing Summary Rockslide xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of rockslide xdmg as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around rockslide xdmg. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.*
