If you must engage one, just find out exactly what it's been assigned to do. I've often found I can waltz right past them by taking advantage of a relevant loophole. A type of yugoloth, canoloths are fiendish trackers and guardians employed by evil powers. They prefer to enter into contracts to guard valuable treasures and important locations. They always do exactly as askedâ€”never any more, never any less. With senses sharp enough to pinpoint the locations of nearby [[conditions#Invisible|invisible]] creatures, canoloths respond unfailingly to any threat to their charges. Furthermore, they emit a magical distortion field that prevents creatures close to them from teleporting. Canoloths confront intruders with swift and terrible force, projecting long, spiny tongues to grab their foes and drag them close. What happens next depends on the contract. Unless instructed to kill, a canoloth merely holds on to its prisoner, but if given the order to do so, it tears its prey limb from limb.```statblock
