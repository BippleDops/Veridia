# Witch Bolt
*1st-level, Evocation*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/witch-bolt.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a twig struck by lightning)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of crackling energy lances toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against it. On a hit, the target takes `2d12` Lightning damage.

On each of your subsequent turns, you can take a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] to deal `d12` Lightning damage to the target automatically, even if the first attack missed.

The spell ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has Total [[cover-xphb|Cover]] from you.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The initial damage increases by `d12` for each spell slot level above 1.
