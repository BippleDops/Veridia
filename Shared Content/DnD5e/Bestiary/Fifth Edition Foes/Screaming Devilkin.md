## Description
Shrill wails echoing through the night signal the arrival of a screaming devilkin. Screaming devilkins are small creatures, humanoid in appearance but with frail, spindly arms and legs. These weak limbs are nearly useless for combat and locomotion, but the screaming devilkin makes up for this disability by flying everywhere with its batlike wings. Screaming devilkins are fast fliers but not particularly agile on the wing.

Screaming devilkins also have a long, muscular, barbed tail that is their primary means of physical attack.

Screaming devilkins are tireless foes. They attack mortals on sight and never back down no matter how a fight is progressing.

A typical screaming devilkin is 3 feet tall and has a wingspan of about 5 feet. Its skin is reddish-brown and its eyes are entirely black. Their barbed tails are up to 4 feet long.
