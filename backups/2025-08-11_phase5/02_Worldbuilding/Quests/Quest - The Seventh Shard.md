### Opening Scenarios (Choose One Based on Campaign)

#### Scenario A: The Scholar's Discovery
**[[Keeper Elara Moonwhisper]]** approaches the party with ancient texts recently decoded from the pre-Shattering archives. Her research reveals disturbing patterns: the six known Shards are drawing closer together through some unseen force, and whoever controls the Seventh will command them all.

*"The mathematics are undeniable—every major event involving the Shards follows a pattern that suggests a seventh, controlling piece. And according to these calculations, it will reveal itself within the month."*

#### Scenario B: The Nightmare Visions
Party members begin experiencing shared dreams of a golden light calling to them from across the realm. These visions intensify after any contact with crystal magic, showing fragmented images:
- A young woman with golden eyes
- A forest sanctuary hidden from the world
- Captain Blackwater's final moments
- A crown reassembling itself

#### Scenario C: The Faction's Desperation
**[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]** secretly contacts the party through intermediaries. The corruption is advancing faster than predicted, and her court mages believe only the Seventh Shard can provide a permanent cure.

*"My daughter grows weaker each day, and I fear what I might become to save her. Find the Seventh Shard before I am forced to make choices that will damn us all."*

#### Scenario D: The Unexpected Inheritance
One party member discovers they've inherited [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Captain Thaddeus Blackwater]]'s effects, including his encrypted journal and a crystal compass that points not north, but toward "divine resonance."

With full knowledge of her nature and the realm's needs, Aria must choose her path:

#### The Innocent's Wisdom
Aria demonstrates that her sheltered upbringing has given her unique perspective:

*"I see now why Father... why Aetheron... chose to scatter his power. United, the Crown makes gods of mortals, but divided, it makes mortals of gods. The question isn't whether I can save everyone—it's whether saving everyone is worth becoming something that no longer understands why they needed saving."*

### The Ultimate Secret Revealed

> [!warning] DM Only - The Deepest Truth
> The Seventh Shard is special because it contains Aetheron's heart/consciousness. Unlike the others, it can think and choose. It selected Aria as host to create a new form of divine being—neither god nor mortal. The Crimson Sage knows this and manipulates events to reunite with this piece of himself, but he genuinely loves what Aria has become and will ultimately choose her happiness over his own restoration.

> [!danger] The Hidden Prophecy
> *"Seven were scattered, seven must choose, The golden light that all did lose, In innocence it hides from sight, Until the darkest needs the light, When daughter meets her mother's eyes, The seventh shard shall crown the wise."* - This prophecy has multiple valid interpretations, and the party's actions determine which one comes true.

> [!info] The Cosmic Context
> This quest is ultimately about the nature of power, innocence, and choice. Aria represents the possibility of divine authority wielded with human compassion. The party's guidance helps determine whether power corrupts absolutely or whether love can redeem even cosmic authority.

---

*The quest for the Seventh Shard reveals that the greatest treasures are not always meant to be claimed, but sometimes to be protected, nurtured, and allowed to choose their own destiny. In finding Aetheron's heart, the heroes discover that true divine power lies not in command over others, but in the wisdom to know when not to use the power one possesses.*
