# Lightbringer
*Weapon ([mace](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/mace-xphb.md)), uncommon*  


- **Damage**: 1d6 bludgeoning
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This +1 mace was made for a cleric of Lathander, the god of dawn. The head of the mace is shaped like a sunburst and made of solid brass. Named Lightbringer, this weapon glows as bright as a [torch](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/torch-xphb.md) when its wielder commands. While glowing, the mace deals an extra `d6` radiant damage to undead creatures.
