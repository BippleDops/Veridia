## Description
The Shadowfell turns visitors around until they become marooned in its twisted landscape. The Lost are representations of the anxiety and fear that people experience when they can't find their way. These sorrowsworn appear as desperate and panicked things.

The Lost try to embrace any creatures they can reach, attempting to find solace in the contact. Aside from the horror of being embraced by such a thing, the victim experiences a flood of fear and panic as its mind buckles under the fury of this assault. The harder the victims' allies fight for release, the worse the experience becomes.
