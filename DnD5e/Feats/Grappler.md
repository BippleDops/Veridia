# Grappler
## Overview
You’ve developed the skills necessary to hold your own in close-quarters grappling. You gain the following benefits:

## Requirements and Restrictions
**Prerequisite**: Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher

## Effects
- You have advantage on attack rolls against a creature you are grappling.
- You can use your action to try to pin a creature grappled by you. To do so, make another grapple check. If you succeed, you and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends.
- Creatures that are one size larger than you don’t automatically succeed on checks to escape your grapple.
