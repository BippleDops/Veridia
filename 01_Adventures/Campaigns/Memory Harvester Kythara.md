**Shadow-Memory Integration.** Kythara exists partially in memory-space, allowing her to step through shadows in the Memory Meadows and access stored experiences directly.

**Deep Mother's Sacred Trust.** Kythara is protected by the Deep Mother's divine power when performing her sacred duties. She has advantage on saving throws against effects that would corrupt, steal, or destroy memories.

**Dream Walker.** Kythara can enter the dreams of sleeping creatures within 1 mile and navigate the collective dream-realm where the Deep Mother's consciousness pools.

**Memory Resoce.** When Kythara touches a memory or dream, she can determine its origin, authenticity, and any alterations that have been made to it.

**Spellcasting.** Kythara is a 15th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save **DC 22**, +14 to hit with spell attacks). She knows the following spells:

- **Cantrips (at will):** guidance, mending, minor illusion, prestidigitation, thaumaturgy

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Kythara makes two Memory Touch attacks or casts two spells.

**Memory Touch.** *Melee Spell Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 16 (`dice: `dice: 3d6`` + 6) psychic damage. Kythara can choose one of the following effects:
- Extract a painful memory, reducing the target's maximum hit points by the damage dealt until they complete a long rest
- Implant a peaceful memory, healing the target for the damage dealt instead
- Modify a recent memory (last 24 hours), similar to the modify memory spell

**Dream Manifestation.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +14 to hit, range 90 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 22 (`dice: `dice: 4d6`` + 8) psychic damage. Kythara manifests one of the target's fears or desires as a semi-solid illusion that lasts for 1 minute.

**Sacred Memory Harvest (Recharge 5-6).** Kythara performs the sacred act of collecting divine dreams. All creatures within 30 feet must make a **DC 22** Wisdom saving throw. Those who fail surrender their most beautiful memory to Kythara, taking 27 (`dice: `dice: 6d8``) psychic damage and becoming stunned until the end of their next turn. Those who succeed take half damage and aren't stunned. Kythara stores the harvested memories to feed to the Deep Mother.

**Memory Storm (1/Day).** Kythara releases a swirling vortex of collected memories in a 60-foot radius. All creatures in the area must make a **DC 22** Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, they take 42 (`dice: `dice: 12d6``) psychic damage and are overwhelmed by random memories for 1 minute, during which they have disadvantage on all rolls. On a success, they take half damage and aren't overwhelmed.

**Deep Mother's Dream Call (1/Day).** Kythara channels the Deep Mother's presence through collected dreams. All creatures within 120 feet must make a **DC 22** Charisma saving throw. Those who fail are charmed for 24 hours and compelled to protect the Memory Meadows and assist in sacred memory collection.

### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)
Kythara can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.

**Move.** Kythara moves up to her speed, potentially stepping through shadow-memory to teleport up to 60 feet.

**Memory Touch.** Kythara makes one Memory Touch attack.

**Shadow Step.** Kythara teleports up to 90 feet to an area of dim light or darkness, or to any location in the Memory Meadows.

**Cast Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Kythara casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.

**Sacred Communion (Costs 3 Actions).** Kythara briefly connects with the Deep Mother through collected memories, gaining insight into immediate threats or divine will.

### Lair Actions
When encountered in the Memory Meadows, Kythara can take lair actions on initiative count 20:

**Memory Maze.** The landscape shifts based on collected memories, creating difficult terrain and potentially disorienting intruders with visions from the stored experiences.

**Divine Memory Manifestation.** A powerful god-dream manifests as a protective entity (use appropriate creature stats) that aids Kythara for 1 minute.

**Meadow Guardian Response.** The Memory Meadows themselves respond to threats, causing memory-flowers to release spores that force **DC 20** Wisdom saves or be charmed by peaceful memories for 1 round.
