# Trap #28 - "The Danger Here Will Be Crystal Clear."
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The would-be tomb robbers will look down a broad corridor that is 20 feet wide, and 50 feet long. The ceiling is 15 feet high. They will see that after an interval wide enough to pennit the bronze entry doors to swing wide the hall is occupied. 1n a rank along the walls on either side, for 30 feet, are 12-foot tall statues of warriors. These warriors are truely unique. They are tall, oddly thin warriors with unnaturally elongated limbs and long, hollow cheeked faces. They are sculpted entirely of crystal. These warriors are a symphony of sharp points and acute angles. Armed with pole weapons edged up their entire length, these objects would be dangerous to a character's continued health if they were even brushed against, let alone if they were to attack.
> 
> The crystal warriors are stationary and transparent. The light from the party's torches will be refracted into a million rainbow glints and highlights, by the thousands of crystaline edges. They are not as great a threat to armored warriors as they would be to lightly armored wizards and rogues who must travel light.
> 
> An alert leader will take one look at this arrangement of "glassw.are" and do his level best to smash the warriors where they stand. The statues are easily broken up. A sharp blow will do the job with ease. The statues wiU collapse into heapsof dagger-likeshards,each shardglass-sharpo nallits edges. Beyond reducing these statues to shards there is little else that can be done as further attacking the piles of shards will only result in smaller, sharper shards. Once they are destroyed there can be seen a mechanism like a stone piston that was fastened to the back of each warrior.
> 
> If the party is not astute enough to smash the statues, and instead goes on through the room, they will be entertained and diverted by a fairly simple mechanism. As the room radiates no magic they will be on their guard for mechanical traps. The entire floor surface is the activator mechanism. It is a long tilt plate rocker switch constructed to balance on a slight bump in the middle so that when the party enters the room it tilts down to set, and when they pass the halfway point the party's weight brings it down on the activator.
> 
> The net result is that the crystal warriors are thrust forward on hydraulically driven pistons smash into each other, and coincidentally any hapless delvers who are in between. This will have a two-fold potential for injury. First from the force of the pistons, which is considerable, and secondarily from the multitude of sharp and penetrating surfaces on the statues themselves. The chances of a party member actually being hit directly by one of the pistons is only 20%, (L2). The chances of a delver who is not heavily armored suffering a slash from a near miss is 30% (L3 ). As a result of the overall rough treatment the statues will shatter into shards as described above. (This may seem obvious, but if the statues are smashed in advance the locaiton of the pistons will be obvious.)
> 
> Pmce the statues have been overcome the party may feel free to proceed to the large double doors at the hall's end. Wrong. 
> 
> This trap may seem like a rather ornate but clumsy effort, rating a mere two skulls, but as with many of Evinrood's best traps this is just the set up.
