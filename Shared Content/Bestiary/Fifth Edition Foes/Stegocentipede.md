## Description
Stegocentipedes are arthropods that have grown to stunning size. They are rumored among sages to have come to the Material Plane from another plane or dimension, though no proof has been found to support this theory. It is based chiefly on the fact that nothing else like it exists. Whatever their origin, they are greatly feared by adventurers and dungeon dwellers.

A stegocentipede raises its spines instinctively when it enters combat, and it moves constantly in a back-and-forth, sawing motion as it fights.

A typical stegocentipede is 18 feet long, but there is much variety among the species. The color of a stegocentipede’s carapace depends on its environment; in wooded areas, they tend toward green and brown, but in underground areas, they tend toward gray and black.
