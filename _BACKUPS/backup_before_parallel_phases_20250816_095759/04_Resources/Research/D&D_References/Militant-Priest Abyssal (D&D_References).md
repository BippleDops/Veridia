Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Militant Priest Abyssal as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Militant Priest Abyssal. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Relationships - **Debtor**: [[Captain Blackwater
