--- # Complete Temporal Mechanics System Builds time travel rules, paradox resolution, temporal combat, chrono-corruption, anomaly events, causal loops, and time-dilated zones. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Time Travel Procedures

1) Define Intent (when/where; personal scope or world scope)
2) Pay Cost (memories, sanity loss, anchor fuel)
3) Roll Timeline Check: `dice: 1d100` vs. Integrity with modifiers from [[Complete Reality Merger System
4) Resolve Paradox Risk; apply loop or branch per Resolution Rules ## Temporal Anomalies (d20 samples)

1 Lost hour • 2 Reverse rain • 3 Two dawns • 4 Child elder • 5 Future scar • 6 Yesterday news • 7 Late shadow • 8 Faded door • 9 Unborn echo • 10 Rust to sap • 11 Spoken tomorrow • 12 Clock melt • 13 Ancient smell • 14 Backward tide • 15 Premature ruin • 16 Posthumous visitor • 17 Looping bell • 18 Twin path • 19 Midnight at noon • 20 Leap month ## Time-Dilated Zones

- Fast/Slow/Stopped bands; pressure/altitude modifiers interact with time flow
- Long exposure: Aging/regression risks; sanity checks Integration: [Complete Reality Merger System]], [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos, [Memory Trading Economy System|Memory Economy]], [[Deep Mother]]. ## Player-Facing Summary Complete Temporal Mechanics System is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Complete Temporal Mechanics System as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Complete Temporal Mechanics System. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A document has gone missing and chaos spreads

- A prisoner has gone missing and war looms
- Someone is protecting information for love ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
