# Aquabyssos Depth Caste System
*"Pressure shapes not just the body, but the soul - and society follows where the depths lead."*

## Overview
The Aquabyssos Depth Caste System represents one of the most complex and entrenched social hierarchies in the underwater realm. Born from practical necessity during the Great Drowning, this pressure-based social structure has evolved into a sophisticated system that governs every aspect of daily life, from marriage prospects to political power. The deeper one can safely descend, the higher their social standing - a brutal meritocracy where biological adaptation determines social destiny.
