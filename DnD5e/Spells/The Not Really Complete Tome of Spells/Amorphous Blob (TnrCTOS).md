# Amorphous Blob (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a glass orb or bottle filled with a specially-prepared, viscous flu-id)

**Duration**: 24 hours


## Effects
You prepare a special fluid inside of a glass orb, a process that takes ten minutes. At any time in the next 24 hours, you may break the orb, releasing the blob within. The blob has the same attributes as the ochre jelly (*Monster Manual* pg.243). At the end of the 24 hours, if the blob has not been released, the fluid breaks down and becomes useless.

The blob has no ability to discern friend from foe and will attack indiscriminately.
