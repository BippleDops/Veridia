*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 361. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A [[monster-xphb|monster]] has a starting attitude toward a [[player-character-xphb|player character]]: [[friendly-attitude-xphb|Friendly]], [[hostile-attitude-xphb|Hostile]], or [[indifferent-attitude-xphb|Indifferent]].

## Adventure Hooks

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
