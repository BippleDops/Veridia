## Overview

The Crystal Plague affects individuals differently based on their background, personality, physical condition, and circumstances of infection. These NPC profiles demonstrate the human stories behind the disease statistics, providing DMs with ready-to-use characters that illustrate different aspects of the plague crisis.

## Stage 1 Infected NPCs

**Location:** [[Crystal Plague Wards]], Room 203  
**Family:** Son Thomas (8, Stage 1), Husband Willem (uninfected, working double shifts to pay for treatment)

#### Physical Description
Marina's crystalline patches follow the geometric patterns of dock rope braiding - parallel lines that intersect at precise angles along her forearms and shoulders. The crystals shimmer with faint blue-green hues that match the harbor water she worked around for fifteen years.

- **Hidden Fear:** That she infected Thomas through maternal contact
- **Daily Routine:** Sketches impossible ship designs that seem to move on their own

*Character Quote:* "The crystals show me ships that could sail between stars. I know it's the plague talking, but the designs are so beautiful. Maybe this is why it happened - so I could see things normal people can't."

#### Plot Hooks

### Progression Over Time
NPCs can advance through plague stages during campaign play, creating ongoing character arcs and emotional investment from players. Some may be saved through player intervention while others choose to embrace transformation.

### Moral Complexity
Each NPC represents different aspects of the plague crisis - victim, researcher, spiritual seeker, conspiracy theorist, and transcended being. Players must navigate relationships without simple "good vs. evil" judgments.

### Information Networks
These NPCs form interconnected networks that span all aspects of plague society - medical, religious, criminal, academic, and governmental. Players can access different information and opportunities through relationship building.

## Adventure Integration Tips

### Personal Stakes
Use these NPCs to create personal connections for player characters. Family members, friends, mentors, or rivals dealing with plague create emotional investment in the storyline.

### Information Sources
Different NPCs provide access to different types of information - medical knowledge, cult theology, government secrets, criminal opportunities, and transcendent wisdom.

### Moral Dilemmas  
Present situations where helping one NPC may harm another, or where the "right" choice is unclear. Use NPC relationships to explore themes of sacrifice, acceptance, and change.

### Character Development
Allow player characters to influence NPC outcomes through their choices and actions. Some NPCs can be saved, others guided toward positive transformation, and some may serve as cautionary tales.
