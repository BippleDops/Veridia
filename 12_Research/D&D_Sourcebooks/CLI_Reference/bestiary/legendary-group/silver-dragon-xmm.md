# Silver Dragon

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing an adult or ancient silver dragon's lair is changed by its magic, creating the following effects:

- **Gentle Gusts.** Winds buoy creatures that fall within 1 mile of the lair. Such creatures descend at a rate of 60 feet per round and take no damage from falling.  
- **Sun and Storms.** While in its lair, the dragon can cast [[control-weather-xphb|Control Weather]], requiring no Material components and using the same spellcasting ability as its Spellcasting action.  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
