## Overview
Lord Commander Octavius Thalassion VII represents the most legitimate claim to reuniting the fractured imperial throne of Aquabyssos. As the great-nephew of [[Emperor Thalassius the Wise]], he carries both the bloodline and the burden of imperial restoration. Unlike pretenders seeking personal power, Octavius genuinely believes in reuniting the scattered fragments of the empire not for conquest, but to restore the golden age of prosperity and stability that existed before [[The Great Drowning|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Drowning]].

Operating from the deep political currents of [[Abyssos Prime]], he leads a sophisticated campaign to gather the Seven Scattered Crowns - fragments of the original [[Crown of Tidal Sovereignty]] that were broken and distributed to prevent any single ruler from wielding absolute power again. His approach combines political maneuvering, diplomatic alliances, and when necessary, strategic force to convince the current fragment holders that unity serves everyone's interests.

## Secrets
> [!warning] DM Only
> - His crown fragment is slowly merging with his consciousness, making him more imperial and less human
> - One of the Crown Fragment holders (Queen Nerida) is secretly his half-sister
> - He's discovered that reunifying the crown will require a willing sacrifice from each holder
> - The original breaking of the crown was done to prevent an ancient prophecy - reunification might trigger it
> - He's been having dreams/visions from the original Emperor Thalassius, possibly beyond death
> - The Tide Guard includes several members who are planning to assassinate fragment holders if diplomacy fails

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Voice**: Soft and measured

**Speech Pattern**: Direct and concise

**Physical Habits**: Remains perfectly still

## Motivations
1. **Primary**: Restore imperial unity to create peace and prosperity for all depth-dwellers
2. **Secondary**: Honor his bloodline and the memory of Emperor Thalassius the Wise
3. **Hidden**: Prevent the growing threats (surface invasion, deep corruption, resource wars) that only unity can address
4. **Personal**: Prove that imperial blood means service to the people, not tyranny over them

## The Seven Crown Fragments Campaign
Octavius's master plan involves seven parallel diplomatic/political campaigns:

### Political Strategy
1. **Economic Incentive**: Demonstrating how reunification increases trade and prosperity
2. **Security Cooperation**: Coordinating defense against common threats
3. **Cultural Renaissance**: Reviving shared imperial traditions and celebrations
4. **Democratic Integration**: Ensuring fragment holders maintain autonomy within the empire
5. **Religious Harmony**: Working with various faiths to support reunification
6. **Gradual Integration**: Starting with loose confederation, moving toward full unity
7. **Voluntary Succession**: Each holder must willingly surrender their fragment

## Quest Hooks
1. **The Great Reconciliation Conference** - PCs help organize/protect the historic gathering
2. **Fragment Heist** - Someone is trying to steal crown fragments to prevent reunification
3. **The Assassination Plot** - Discover and stop plots against fragment holders
4. **Cultural Renaissance** - Help organize celebrations that build support for unity
5. **The Ancient Prophecy** - Investigate what the original crown breaking was meant to prevent
6. **Deep Threat Rising** - Coordinate response to threats that only unity can address
7. **The Democratic Challenge** - Navigate the political challenge of monarchist vs. republican ideals

## Speaking Style
*"The crown was never meant to rule over the people, but to serve them. Each fragment holder has proven their worthiness to lead - now imagine what we could accomplish together."* - To fragment holders

*"I am not asking you to bow to an emperor. I am asking you to stand with me as equals in rebuilding something greater than any of us could achieve alone."* - To republican opponents

*"The deep currents flow toward unity. We can swim with them toward prosperity, or against them toward isolation and decline."* - To his advisors
