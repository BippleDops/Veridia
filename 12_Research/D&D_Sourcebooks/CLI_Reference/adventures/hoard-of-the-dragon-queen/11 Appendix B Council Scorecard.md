# Appendix B: Council Scorecard
*Source: Hoard of the Dragon Queen, p. 177* 

In the course of *Tyranny of Dragons*, several factions and powerful individuals might be compelled to oppose the machinations of the Cult of the Dragon. Some groups eagerly lend their assistance. Others require more convincing.

This scorecard helps track various factions' support for the struggle against the Cult of the Dragon. If you didn't play *Hoard of the Dragon Queen*, assume that events marked with an asterisk (*) occurred, but that the unmarked events did not.

A printable scorecard is available at DungeonsandDragons.com (http://media.wizards.com/2014/downloads/dnd/risetiamat_councilscorecard.pdf).
