*Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 111* - **Alignment**: Neutral Good
- **Domains**: Arcana, Trickery
- **Pantheon**: Gnome
- **Province**: Illusion, deception
- **Symbol**: Dagger against a hooded cloak When gnomes arrived in the world, Baravar protected them by teaching them how to hide, use magic, and deceive their foes. She was once entrapped by the goblin god Khurgorbaeyag, and after escaping and gaining her revenge, she began the practice of never wearing the same face twice, and she follows a different routine every day so no one can predict what she might do. When gnomes tell stories of their gods' adventures, Baravar is always the last to be found when the group forms, but she nevertheless swiftly agrees to support Garl's plans. Forest gnomes and deep gnomes owe their innate magical abilities to Baravar, and all gnomes get their natural defense against magic from her shrewdness. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Gnome baravar cloakshadow mtf is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
