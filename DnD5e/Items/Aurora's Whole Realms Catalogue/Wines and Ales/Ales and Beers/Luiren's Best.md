## Description
Brewed by the Smokardin clan of coastal Luiren, this hefty stout is as black as ink and nearly as thick as the snows of the Spine of the World. Possessed of a sweet flavor and a frothy head, this halflingsâ€™ brew lives up to its name. Found easily in Luiren, Halruaa, and the Shining South, it is rarely transported north aside from its limited exports to my outlets in Sembia. Hand keg, 3 sp; cask, 2 gp; barrel, 5 gp; butt, 15 gp; tun, 30 gp.
