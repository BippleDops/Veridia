# The Theological Warfare Grounds
## Where Faith Battles Faith in Holy Combat

> *"Here gods war through mortal hands, and every prayer is both blessing and battlecry"*

## Overview

The Theological Warfare Grounds represent the most dangerous and spiritually charged location in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Abyssos Prime—a designated battlefield where competing religious factions settle their theological disputes through a combination of formal debate, divine magic, and when necessary, holy combat. This complex serves as both arena and embassy, where the major religious powers of the underwater world engage in an ongoing war of faiths that has lasted since [02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Great Drowning]].

What makes this location unique is that violence here is not random or chaotic but ritualized and regulated. The various religious factions have agreed that rather than allowing theological disputes to tear apart society, they will be resolved in formal combat under strict rules. This has created a bizarre fusion of monastery, military base, and gladiatorial arena where priests dual with both scripture and sword.

### Key Statistics
- **Depth Range:** 2,600-2,900 feet below surface
- **Population:** ~500 religious warriors, priests, and support staff
- **Government:** Religious Council of War (rotating leadership)
- **Pressure Zone:** Severe (**DC 16**-18)
- **Temporal Stability:** 30% (competing divine influences create reality distortions)

## Historical Context

### The Divine Schism
The Great Drowning didn't just transform the physical world—it created a theological crisis. Different religious groups interpreted the catastrophe in radically different ways, leading to fundamental disagreements about divine will, the nature of existence, and humanity's relationship with higher powers.

### The First Holy War
Initially, these theological differences led to violent conflicts throughout [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Abyssos Prime, threatening to destroy the already fragile post-drowning society. The violence escalated until the city faced religious civil war.

### The Covenant of Contained Conflict
Rather than allow theological disputes to destroy civilization, the major religious factions signed the Covenant of Contained Conflict, establishing the Theological Warfare Grounds as the designated location for resolving religious disputes through regulated combat.

**Covenant Principles:**
- Religious disputes will be settled through formal challenge
- Combat will follow established rules and protocols
- Civilian populations will be protected from religious warfare
- All major faiths will have equal access to the grounds
- Divine magic is permitted and encouraged during combat
