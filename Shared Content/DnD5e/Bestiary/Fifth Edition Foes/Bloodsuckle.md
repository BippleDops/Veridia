*This is a nightmarish plant consisting of a bulbous root and several vinelike tendrils, each ending in a hollow, needlelike point. Woody limbs as thick as a human’s leg sprout from the trunk. Its leaves are a vile greenish color and constantly drip a sticky, foul-smelling sap.*

## Special Traits
**Create Host:** A bloodsuckle that grapples a living target injects its poison sap into the victim. The target creature must make a successful DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become dominated by the bloodsuckle, as if the plant had cast dominate person on the victim. Immunity or resistance to poison applies normally to this sap. Domination is permanent until broken by a successful save or by the death of the bloodsuckle. The host does not get additional saving throws when it takes damage; instead, a host with an Intelligence of 3 or higher is allowed another DC 14 Wisdom saving throw with tactical advantage to break the bloodsuckle's control when it is commanded to act in a manner inconsistent with its alignment or to turn against its allies.

**Host Sense:** A bloodsuckle automatically senses the location of any hosts within 100 feet.

**Seed:** Once per month, a bloodsuckle generates a walnutsized seed that it implants in one host's body. The host's maximum number of hit points reduces by `dice: 1d10` per day. When its maximum hit points reach 0, the host dies and a new bloodsuckle plant erupts from the corpse. A greater restoration or blight spell destroys the seedling.

## Actions
**Constriction:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d4+3`) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (`dice: 1d12`) piercing damage, and the target is grappled. If this attack deals 9 or more piercing damage, the bloodsuckle releases this victim and seeks another. Also see Create Host, above.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate

**Organization**: Solitary or orchard (2–20)

## Description
Bloodsuckles are semi-intelligent and immobile plants that gain nourishment from the blood of living creatures. Unlike other carnivorous plants, the bloodsuckle maintains a herd of living hosts that i t feeds on.

Bloodsuckles are found in forests, swamps, and rolling hills in temperate climes. They are never found in arctic regions, but a variety of this plant is suspected to exist in tropical regions.

When a bloodsuckle detects movement within 30 feet, it sends out its long, vinelike tendrils toward the disturbance. When the tendril strikes a living target, one set of needles sucks blood from the victim while another set injects sap into the victim. The sap brings the creature under the plant’s control. A bloodsuckle automatically recognizes its own hosts and never attacks them. Rather, it lets the host approach so it can embrace it with its tendrils and consume more blood.

A victim that becomes a host returns to the plant whenever the plant calls. Such hosts are normally used by the bloodsuckle for feeding purposes, but if the plant comes under attack, it will also summon nearby hosts for defense. Once per month, it summons a host that it senses is near death and implants it with a seed, then typically commands that host to walk until it dies. Thus the bloodsuckle spreads far and wide across the land.
