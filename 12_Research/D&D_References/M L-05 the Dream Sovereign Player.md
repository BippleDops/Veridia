# The Dream Sovereign

Sleep leans over everything. You can feel a question in the dark: Will you dream with me?

What you notice
- Voices speaking in your own
- The ship humming along

What you can try
- Speak back with courage
- Trade a memory for a promise

Possible outcomes
- A boon youâ€™ll never forget
- A curse you can live with
- A rule written in someone elseâ€™s dream
