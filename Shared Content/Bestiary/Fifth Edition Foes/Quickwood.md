## Special Traits
**Fear Aura:** If a quickwood makes a successful saving throw against a spell that would have damaged it, the quickwood takes no damage but instead absorbs some of the spells energy and immediately releases it as a fear spell in a 30-foot radius instead of a cone. Saving throws against this fear are made against DC 12.

**Grasping Roots:** A creature grappled by a quickwood can break free with a successful DC 16 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or by inflicting 10 slashing damage against the grappling root, thereby severing it from the plant. Roots have AC 14. Damage done to a root is not subtracted from the plants overall hit points, and severing a root doesnt reduce the quickwoods number of root attacks. If a creature is grappled by more than one root, each root must be severed or overpowered individually.

**Remote Sensing:** A quickwood can see and hear through any normal oak tree within 360 feet of the quickwood. It can see and hear through up to ten oak trees at a time, and it can drop one tree and add another as a bonus action once per round. An oak tree utilized as a magical sensor develops a vaguely humanlike visage on its trunk that seems to peer around itself.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A quickwood bites once and attacks four times with its roots.

**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 18 (`dice: 3d8+5`) piercing damage. This attack roll has tactical advantage against a target thats grappled by the quickwood.

**Root:** *Melee Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 30 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (`dice: 1d10+5`) bludgeoning damage and the target must make a successful DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be grappled and dragged 15 feet closer to the quickwood. This attack roll has tactical advantage against a target thats already grappled by the quickwood.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate forests, hills, and mountains

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
Quickwoods appear as nothing more than common oak trees, and are indistinguishable from them at distances greater than 30 feet. Closer inspection can reveal a humanlike visage in the trunk, but unless the quickwood moves, even this “face” is likely to be dismissed as nothing more than an unusual arrangement of bark and knots.

Quickwoods are carnivorous, and they prefer the taste of human and elven flesh above all others. Quickwoods usually root themselves to a particular location and rarely move. When they do move, they pull themselves along slowly with their roots.

Quickwoods use their remote sensing ability to keep close tabs on their surroundings. If trespassers are detected, the creature simply waits until one or more potential victims come within range of its roots before striking. A grabbed opponent is pulled close enough for the quickwood to bite it.

Four root attacks matches up to the “typical” quickwood, but larger and smaller versions can make more or fewer attacks.
