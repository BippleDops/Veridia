- **Surface Pitting**: Small holes or rough patches
- **Asymmetric Growth**: Irregular or twisted formations
- **Distorted Sound**: Off-key or multiple tones when struck

### Advanced Corruption Indicators
- **Black Veins**: Dark lines running through crystal structure
- **Pulsing Darkness**: Rhythmic dark energy emissions
- **Spreading Cracks**: Fracture lines that grow over time
- **Heat/Cold Spots**: Irregular temperature variations
- **Reality Distortion**: Space appears warped near crystal

### Severe Corruption (IMMEDIATE EVACUATION)
- **Void Presence**: Areas of absolute darkness within crystal
- **Moving Shadows**: Dark shapes that seem to shift and writhe
