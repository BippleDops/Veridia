## Description
While you wear these boots, you have a [[13 - Movement and Position|flying]] speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the boots to [[13 - Movement and Position|fly]] for up to 4 hours,  all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.

The boots regain 2 hours of [[13 - Movement and Position|flying]] capability for every 12 hours they arenâ€™t in use.
