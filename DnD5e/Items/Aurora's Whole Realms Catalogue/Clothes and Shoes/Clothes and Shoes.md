# Clothes and Shoes
## Overview
An old Vaasan expression states that the only thing that separates a man from a yeti is his sword. I would include clothes also in that distinction. Though the rich can afford tailored attire, most peasants, merchants, and artisans could well use inexpensive, durable, and attractive clothing. All our clothing is created in Saerloon of solid Daerlunian wool and linen. Through special order (and extra payment) many designs are available in exotic cotton weaves from Maztica, silk from Shou Lung, velvet from Hillsfar, and even the leather of Elturel. All clothes are available in white, black, gray, beige, brown. 

Most can be dyed red, blue, yellow, or green for an added 2 sp. For added comfort, our shoes come in four different sizes: halfling, elven, human, and jumbo. (Of course, halfling-size shoes more often end up on the feet of human children than on the hairy feet of halflings). All our shoes and boots are crafted by members of the Cobblerâ€™s Guild in Ordulin, and each carry the guild stamp. We even offer the famous Ordulinan orc-spiker boots at only one sp over the market-stall price.
