--- # Falling Net

*Generic Hazard* A falling net trap uses a trip wire to release a weighted, 10-foot-square [[Net Xphb]] suspended from the ceiling. The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The first creature that crosses the trip wire causes the Net to fall on it. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or have the [[conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition until it escapes. The target succeeds automatically if it's Huge or larger. A creature can take an action to make a DC 10 Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach from the Net on a successful check. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Detect and Disarm As a [[actions#Search|Search]] action, a creature can examine the trapped area and make a DC 11 Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) check, detecting the trip wire and the suspended Net on a successful check. Once detected, the trip wire can be easily cut or avoided (no ability check required). ## Destroy the Net Reducing the Net to 0 Hit Points frees any creature trapped in it (see the "Player's Handbook" for the [[Net Xphb]] statistics). ## Set the Trap A creature that has [[thieves-tools-xphb (items)]] and all the trap's components (including a Net) can try to set a falling net trap, doing so with a successful DC 13 Dexterity ([[skills#Sleight%20of%20Hand|Sleight of Hand]]) check. Each attempt to set this trap takes 10 minutes. ## At Higher Levels You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing the weight of the Net, which increases the save DC and the DC of the Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check as follows: DC 12 at levels 5â€“10, DC 14 at levels 11â€“16, or DC 16 at levels 17â€“20. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 100. Available in the SRD* ## Player-Facing Summary Falling net xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of falling net xdmg as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around falling net xdmg. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A letter reveals ancient history about the government
