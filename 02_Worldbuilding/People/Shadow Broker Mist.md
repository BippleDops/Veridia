# Shadow Broker Mist
*The Whisper in the Dark, She Who Sells Secrets, The Living Shadow*

## Overview
Known only as "Mist," this enigmatic figure operates in the liminal spaces between light and shadow throughout [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]. More shadow than flesh after years of bonding with umbral entities, she trades in the most dangerous commodity of all: secrets. Unlike [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Jasper "Three-Eyes" Flint]]'s crude information brokerage, Mist deals in secrets that can topple governments, destroy lives, or grant impossible power. Her true identity, origins, and even physical form remain mysteries that have confounded investigators for years.

## Appearance
- **Physical Form**: Constantly shifting between human and shadow
- **Height**: Appears to be 5'6", but dimensions seem fluid
- **Distinguishing Features**:
  - **No fixed appearance**: Face and form shift like smoke
  - **Shadow integration**: Lower body often dissolves into writhing darkness
  - **Eyes**: Only constant feature - glowing pale violet in the dark
  - **Voice**: Comes from everywhere and nowhere, like whispers in water
- **Clothing**: Seems to wear darkness itself, occasionally manifests as elegant robes

## Personality
- **Public Persona**: Rarely appears in person, communicates through intermediaries
- **Core Nature**: Coldly calculating, views emotions as weaknesses to exploit
- **Values**: Information, power, the thrill of orchestrating events from shadows
