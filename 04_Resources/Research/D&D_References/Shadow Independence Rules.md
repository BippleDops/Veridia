Practical, table-ready rules for Shadow Independence Rules across Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. ## Player-Facing Summary Shadow Independence Rules is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Shadow Independence Rules as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Shadow Independence Rules. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Secret Covenant - Summon ancient evil ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
