## Overview
Suspended in the open water at 2,800 feet depth, the Bathyal Palace is a massive structure of crystallized water and compressed pearl that serves as the neutral meeting ground for all major factions of [[Aquabyssos World Overview. Built on the site where the last surface kingdoms signed their final treaty before [The Great Drowning]], it remains magically neutral territory where violence is supposedly impossible.

### The Neutral Hall
A vast central chamber where faction representatives meet. The [[Bathyal Succession council convenes here, with each faction holding an equal voice. [Mediator Serenity Stillwater]] facilitates negotiations with supernatural patience.

### The Embassy Ring
Circular arrangement of embassy suites, each maintained by different factions:
- [[Tethyan Hegemony suite (East)
- [Coral Courts]] chambers (South)
- [[Depth Wardens quarters (North)
- [Church of the Tidal Throne]] sanctuary (West)
- [[Free Current hidden rooms (location varies)

### The Archive of Accords
Library containing every treaty, agreement, and contract signed in the palace. [Keeper of Contracts Minerva Bindingword]] ensures all agreements are magically enforced.

### The Depth Gardens
Floating gardens of cultivated kelp and coral where private negotiations occur. [[Garden Keeper Zen Currentdancer maintains the delicate ecosystem and "accidentally" overhears many secrets.

### The Observation Sphere
Transparent sphere at the palace's peak offering 360-degree views. Used for divination and watching for approaching threats or visitors.

### The Peace Field
Magical barrier preventing all violence within the palace. Weapons become ethereal, and hostile magic simply fails. [Enchanter Valdris Peacewarden]] maintains this ancient magic.

### The Speaking Pool
Scrying pool allowing communication with any location in Aquabyssos. Heavily monitored and restricted to official use.

### The Neutral Vault
Repository of disputed items held until ownership is resolved. Currently contains several artifacts including pieces of [[The Pressure Crown.

### The Treaty Stone
Original stone where the pre-drowning treaty was signed. Touching it while lying causes immediate expulsion from the palace.

### Ongoing Schemes
1. The succession crisis - who will lead when [Mediator Stillwater]] retires
2. Secret alliance negotiations between unlikely factions
3. Assassination attempts disguised as accidents
4. Theft of treaty documents to void agreements
5. Infiltration by [[Deepmind Conspiracy agents

### The Diplomatic Suite
Luxury accommodations for visiting dignitaries. [Concierge Phillip Gracewater]] attends to guests while gathering intelligence.

### The Neutral Table
Restaurant serving cuisine from all regions. [[Chef Amara Tastecurrent creates dishes that remind diners of the surface world.

### The Bathyal Bank
Ficial institution managing inter-faction trade. [Banker Cornelius Goldflow]] knows everyone's debts and assets.

### The Message Service
Secure courier service between factions. [[Courier Chief Swift Currentrider guarantees delivery and discretion.

## Current Events
1. Emergency session called regarding [The Deep Uprising]]
2. Duke Reefheart accused of biological warfare
3. Missing diplomat from [[New Tethys
4. Proposal to admit [The Trencher Folk]] as a faction
5. Peace Field flickering in certain areas
