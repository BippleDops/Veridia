# Pearl Harbor City
*Gateway Between Worlds*

## Overview

Pearl Harbor City stands as Aquathys's primary connection to the surface world, a bustling metropolis built within a massive underwater dome that maintains variable pressure zones. The city exists in a constant state of controlled chaos as traders, smugglers, diplomats, and adventurers from both above and below the waves converge here.

Pearl Harbor City is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Pearl Harbor City as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Pearl Harbor City.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Pearl Harbor City to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at Pearl Harbor City to avert a public scandal.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
