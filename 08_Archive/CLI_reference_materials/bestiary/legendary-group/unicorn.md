# Unicorn

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual_

Transformed by the creature's celestial presence, the domain of a unicorn might include any of the following magical effects:

- Open flames of a non magical nature are extinguished within the unicorn's domain. Torches and campfires refuse to burn, but closed lanterns are unaffected.  
- Creatures native to the unicorn's domain have an easier time hiding; they have advantage on all Dexterity ([Stealth](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Stealth)) checks made to hide.  
- When a good-aligned creature casts a spell or uses a magical effect that causes another good-aligned creature to regain hit points, the target regains the maximum number of hit points possible for the spell or effect.  
- Curses affecting any good-aligned creature are suppressed.  

If the unicorn dies, these effects end immediately.

## Player-Facing Summary

Unicorn is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of unicorn as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around unicorn.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties unicorn to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at unicorn to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to unicorn active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
