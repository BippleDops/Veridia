# Quieting the Depths

*"Some sounds should never echo in the deep."*

## Overview
A supernatural crisis quest where an ancient evil stirs in the deepest ocean trenches, sending disturbing sounds and psychic disturbances throughout Aquabyssos. Citizens report hearing whispers in their dreams, and some have begun sleepwalking toward the depths.

Ancient texts suggest this awakening occurs every few centuries and requires specific rituals to quiet the entity before it fully emerges.
