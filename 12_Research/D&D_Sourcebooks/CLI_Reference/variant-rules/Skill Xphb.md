A skill is an "area of specialization" associated with an ability check. If you have proficiency in a skill, you can add your [[proficiency-xphb|Proficiency Bonus]] when you make an ability check associated with that skill.

Skill xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

## Adventure Hooks

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
