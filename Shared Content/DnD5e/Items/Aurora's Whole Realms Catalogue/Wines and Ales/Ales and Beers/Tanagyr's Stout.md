## Description
This product is one of few exempted from trade embargoes against Zhentil Keep: a heavy, pitch-black stout with a low, rich malt flavorâ€”the richest, smoothest, headiest drink this side of Evermead. This drink has long been limited to the Moonsea region, but is expanding its trade farther south, using unmarked barrels to avoid the stigma of its point of origin. Hand keg, 35 cp; cask, 25 sp; barrel, 6 gp; butt, 20 gp; tun, 50 gp.
