# Fount of Moonlight
*4th-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

A cool light wreathes your body for the duration, emitting [[Light Xphb]] in a 20-foot radius and [[Light Xphb]] for an additional 20 feet.

Until the spell ends, you have [[boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats)]] to Radiant damage, and your melee attacks deal an extra `2d6` Radiant damage on a hit.

In addition, immediately after you take damage from a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself, you can take a [[reaction-xphb (variant-rules)]] to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature has the [[conditions#Blinded|Blinded]] condition until the end of your next turn.

**Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]
