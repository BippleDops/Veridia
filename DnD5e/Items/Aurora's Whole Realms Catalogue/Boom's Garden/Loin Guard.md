## Description
A common and useful piece of fashion armor, our loin guards hang securely from our broad belt and can turn even the most ignominious of blows. We offer plain, patterned, and gem-setting loin guards. Patterns available are triangles, circles, stippling and lightning strikes. Gem setting loin guards can hold up to 100 gems (laid by a jeweler after purchase). All types cost the same amount in bronze (5 gp), iron (3 gp), steel (6 gp), silver (30 gp) and gold (60 gp).
