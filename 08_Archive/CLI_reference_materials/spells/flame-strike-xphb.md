# Flame Strike
*5th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sulfur)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A vertical column of brilliant fire roars down from above. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [Cylinder](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on a point within range makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `5d6` Fire damage and `5d6` Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The Fire damage and the Radiant damage increase by `d6` for each spell slot level above 5.

**Classes**: [Paladin (Oath of Devotion)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-devotion-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Cleric (Light Domain)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-light-domain-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Cleric](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
