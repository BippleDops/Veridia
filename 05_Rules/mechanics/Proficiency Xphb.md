--- # Proficiency

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 372. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* If you have proficiency with something, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to any [[d20-test-xphb (variant-rules) you make using that thing. A creature might have proficiency in a skill or [Death Saving Throw Xphb]] or with a weapon or tool. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Proficiency xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of proficiency xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around proficiency xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Hidden Prophecy of Depths ## Plot Hooks - A journal reveals ancient history about the government
