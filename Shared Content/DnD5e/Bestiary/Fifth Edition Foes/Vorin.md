## Special Traits
**Camouflage:** A vorin thats submerged in water or mud can be spotted with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check.

**Seeping Poison:** If the target of the vorins spit attack is wearing armor, then the poison needs one round to seep through gaps in the armor and contact the targets skin. The target or an adjacent ally can use an action to make a DC 15 Dexterity check; success indicates the poison was scraped off completely before it penetrated the armor. An edged weapon or tool must be used. Any slashing weapon and most piercing weapons will do the job. Note that only the vorins spit needs to seep through armor; poison from its sting does not.

Water Breathing: A vorin breathes equally well in air or water.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A vorin attacks three times. It spits, then bites, directing both attacks at the same target if it can. It also stings, and that attack can be aimed at any target within reach.

**Spit:** *Ranged Attack:* +8 to hit, range 25 ft., one creature. Hit: the target must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated. An incapacitated creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its next turn. A successful save ends the incapacitation, but if the saving throw fails, the creature is paralyzed for `dice: 1d4` hours. If the target creature is wearing armor, see Seeping Poison, above.

**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 16 (`dice: 2d10+5`) piercing damage.

**Sting:** *Melee Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 21 (`dice: 3d10+5`) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be incapacitated. An incapacitated creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its next turn. A successful save ends the incapacitation, but if the saving throw fails, the creature is paralyzed for `dice: 1d4` hours

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any marsh

**Organization**: Solitary or knot (2–5)

## Description
Vorins live in dismal swamps and bogs, where they lurk in the murk and the mire. Only its slightly bulging eyes protrude above the water or the mud as it watches for potential prey.

A vorin is difficult to injure with blunt force; its squishy, boneless body gives easily under heavy blows that don’t break its thick hide.

The vorin’s proboscis contains muscular tubes that are used to spit gobs of sticky, poisonous saliva up to 25 feet. Each gob is the size of a small melon, and the substance seems almost to have a mind of its own as it oozes across an armored surface seeking a way through to the soft, vulnerable flesh underneath.

A vorin relies heavily on its spit attack in combat, hoping to incapacitate opponents before emerging from the slime to finish them off with its bite and its stinger. If its spit attacks aren’t having the desired effect, it submerges and appears to swim away. In fact, it probably is shadowing its prey from a distance while keeping out of sight, waiting for an opportunity to try again under more favorable circumstances. Although the creature is dumb as a post in most ways, it is a wily hunter.
