# Mantis-Thing from Between
## Overview
### Mantis-Thing from Between
![[v3flcm2j.yb4.png|Mantis-Thing from Between|300]]
[[v3flcm2j.yb4.png|open outside]]

*It is fleshy, but in a revoltingly waxy, insectoid way. It staggers on several insect legs and drags itself along on two long limbs, making the thing look like it is obsequiously praying to some demented god as it moves. It has a vast, bloated head riddled with teeth, but moves with appalling speed despite its large size. As it moves, sinews, faces, and limbs of people bloat its flesh, and horribly distorted hands grope outward from this vile host. Wreathed about its sickening flesh are palpable manifestations of misery, regret, and bitter, dashed hope.*

**Size**: Large

**Type**: Aberration

## Special Traits
**Cocoon (1/day):** The mantis-thing can encase a grappled, incapacitated creature of up to Medium size in a dense cocoon (AC 10, 30 hp, immune to all but slashing damage) composed of fibrous material spun out of its mouth. The process takes 1 minute for creatures smaller than Small, 2 minutes for Small creatures, and 3 minutes for Medium creatures.

**Immune to Transformation:** A mantis-thing is immune to effects that would alter its form.

**Incubation:** Once an egg is implanted, it releases enzymes that paralyze the victim for as long as the egg remains in the body. The egg hatches `dice: 1d4` days later. When it does, the young mantis-thing consumes the host’s internal organs, killing the creature. Removing an egg takes 10 minutes and a successful DC 15 Wis (Medicine) check; a creature without proficiency in Medicine has tactical disadvantage on the check. Each attempt also does `dice: 2d6` slashing damage to the host, whether the check succeeds or fails. Magic that cures disease, such as lesser restoration or a potion of vitality, also destroys the egg without harming the host, but immunity to paralysis or disease offers no protection.

**Pack Attack:** The mantis-thing has tactical advantage on its attack roll if the target is within 5 feet of one or more allies of the mantis-thing that are able to attack.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The mantis-thing makes two claw attacks.

**Lunge (recharge 5-6):** +8 to hit (reach 20 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 4d8 + 5` slashing damage, and the target must make a successful DC 16 Con saving throw or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

**Melee Attack—Claw:** +8 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d8 + 5` slashing damage. If both claw attacks hit the same target on the mantis-thing’s turn, the target is grappled (escape DC 15) and the mantis-thing can make a proboscis attack against it as a bonus action.

**Melee Attack—Implant Egg:** +8 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one grappled creature). Hit: a mantis-thing egg is implanted in the creature, which is paralyzed and becomes subject to Incubation (see below).

**Melee Attack—Proboscis:** +5 to hit (one grappled creature). Hit: `dice: 1d4 + 2` piercing damage, and the creature must make a successful DC 14 Con saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of its next turn.

## Description
**Environment**: Any land (Between)

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, or nest (3–8)

Mantis-things are exaggerated versions of insects, distorted by the horror of parasitic infestation and the misery of hopelessness. They are semi-intelligent, and communicate via a language composed of clicks from their mouthparts, and the position and trembling of their patterned forelimbs.
