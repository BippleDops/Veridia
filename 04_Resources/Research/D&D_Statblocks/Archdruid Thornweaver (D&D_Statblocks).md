*Voice of the Ancient Forest, Guardian of the Green* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Archdruid Thornweaver has protected [[The Verdant Reach|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Verdant Reach for three centuries, watching the forest struggle against crystal expansion. Leading the [The Verdant Accord|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Verdant Accord]], she represents the natural world's resistance to crystalline corruption. Ancient, wise, and increasingly desperate, she may be the last hope for preserving the pre-Shattering world. ### During the Crystallization

> [!warning] DM Only - Her Secret Memory

> She saw one of the Seven Betrayers—the original Thornweaver, her ancestor—participate in the Crown's breaking. She hides this shame and has spent centuries trying to atone. ## Secret Knowledge

> [!warning] DM Only

> - Knows location of the Green Shard (Southern Spire)
> - Her ancestor was one of the Seven Betrayers
> - Has been in contact with [[The Crimson Sage|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]]
> - The forest itself is becoming sentient from crystal exposure
> - Plans to awaken the World-Tree to fight crystals
> - Knows the true cure for corruption (requires massive life sacrifice) ## The Great Withering

> [!warning] DM Only - Ultimate Plan

> If all else fails, she can trigger the Great Withering—killing all plant life on the continent to starve out the crystals. This would doom millions but might save the world. ## Speaking Style

*"I have watched this forest for three centuries. I will not see it die in the fourth."* *"You humans measure time in years. I measure it in trees. And too many have fallen."* *"The crystals are not evolution—they are infection. And infections must be purged."* ## The Sacred Grove

Her seat of power, containing:
- The Heart Tree (500 years old)
- Pool of Pure Water (uncorrupted)
- Circle of Standing Stones (pre-Shattering)
