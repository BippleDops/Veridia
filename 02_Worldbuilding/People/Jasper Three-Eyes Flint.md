## Overview
Jasper "Three-Eyes" Flint is the most notorious information broker operating between Aethermoor and Aquabyssos, a man whose supernatural sight makes him invaluable to those who need to know secrets and deadly to those who have secrets to hide. Born with a rare magical mutation that granted him a literal third eye, Jasper has parlayed his unique gift into a thriving business selling information, secrets, and carefully curated truths to clients from across both realms.

Operating from The Crossroads Tavern in the neutral zone between the two great powers, Jasper maintains strict neutrality while profiting from the conflicts and conspiracies that swirl around him. His reputation is built on three pillars: he always knows more than he tells, his prices are fair but non-negotiable, and crossing him results in having your deepest secrets sold to your worst enemies.

## Physical Description
Jasper appears to be a man in his early forties, of average height and build, with the kind of unremarkable features that help him blend into any crowd. His brown hair is kept neat but not fashionable, and he dresses in well-made but unremarkable clothing that wouldn't look out of place in either realm. However, his most distinctive feature is impossible to hide: a fully functional third eye positioned in the center of his forehead.

This mystical eye is larger than his natural ones, with an iris that shifts between silver, gold, and deep purple depending on what kind of supernatural sight he's using. When all three eyes are open, they create an unsettling triangular pattern that most people find deeply uncomfortable to look at directly.

The third eye is usually closed, appearing as little more than a wrinkled scar when not in use. When opened, it provides him with supernatural vision that can see through illusions, detect lies, peer into other planes, and even glimpse potential futures. The eye occasionally weeps a silvery fluid that he collects and uses as a component in his information-gathering rituals.

## Personality
- **Public Persona**: Affable tavern keeper, good listener, discreet confidant, neutral mediator
- **Business Mode**: Sharp, calculating, uncompromising about payment, scrupulously fair
- **Hidden Nature**: Deeply curious about cosmic forces, haunted by visions he can't unsee, secretly lonely
- **Values**: Information as currency, neutrality as survival, knowledge as power, reputation as protection
- **Fears**: Losing his sight, being blinded to major threats, his neutrality being discovered as false
- **Quirks**: Unconsciously closes his third eye when telling lies, always knows what people want to drink before they order

## Background
Jasper was born to unremarkable parents in a small border town that was destroyed during a magical catastrophe when he was twelve. The same arcane explosion that killed his family and erased his hometown from the map also opened his third eye and granted him supernatural sight. Found wandering the ruins by traveling merchants, he was taken to various healers and mystics who declared his condition both incurable and invaluable.

Spending his teenage years as a curiosity and fortune-teller for traveling caravans, Jasper learned early that information was the most valuable commodity in a world full of secrets. He saved every coin, learned every language he could, and carefully built a network of contacts across both realms. By age 25, he had purchased The Crossroads Tavern and established himself as the premier neutral ground for information exchange.

Over the past fifteen years, Jasper has become legendary among spies, diplomats, and adventurers as the man who knows everything and tells just enough. His third eye allows him to verify the truth of information brought to him and to see connections and patterns that escape normal perception. However, the same gift that made his fortune also burdens him with knowledge of cosmic horrors and potential disasters that he's powerless to prevent.

## Special Abilities

**Third Eye Sight.** Jasper's mystical third eye grants him several supernatural senses:
- **Truesight** (120 ft.): Can see through illusions, shapechanging, and invisibility
- **Lie Detection**: Automatically knows when someone is lying or telling half-truths
- **Aura Reading**: Can sense the general emotional state and magical nature of creatures
- **Future Glimpses**: Can briefly see potential outcomes of current events (3 times per day)
- **Plane Sight**: Can see into adjacent planes and detect planar influences

**Information Network.** Jasper can use his network of contacts to gather information about any person, place, or event. This functions as a *legend lore* spell that takes 8 hours of sending messages and costs appropriate fees.

**Neutral Ground.** The Crossroads Tavern is under powerful magical protections that prevent violence, mind-reading, and magical scrying. Jasper can extend these protections to cover negotiations he mediates.

**Master of Secrets.** Jasper has advantage on all rolls related to gathering, concealing, or trading information. He can also cast *zone of truth* once per day without expending a spell slot.

**Warlock Pact (The Great Eye).** Jasper has made a pact with a cosmic entity of knowledge and sight. He can cast the following spells:
- **Cantrips (at will)**: *eldritch blast*, *minor illusion*, *prestidigitation*
- **1st-3rd level (2 3rd-level slots per short rest)**: *charm person*, *detect thoughts*, *clairvoyance*, *counterspell*

## Actions

**Multiattack.** Jasper makes two attacks with his Hidden Blade or casts a spell and makes one weapon attack.

**Hidden Blade.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d4 + 4) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) sneak attack damage. If the target is surprised, they must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution save or be paralyzed for 1 round from a poison coating.

**Truth Compulsion (3/Day).** Jasper opens his third eye and focuses on one creature within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to answer one question truthfully. This effect pierces most magical protections against mind reading.

**Revelation Strike (1/Day).** Jasper whispers a devastating secret about a target within 60 feet. The target takes 21 (6d6) psychic damage and must make a DC 17 Charisma save or be stunned until the end of their next turn as they process the implications of what he knows.

**Emergency Escape (1/Day).** If reduced to 20 hit points or fewer, Jasper can activate hidden escape routes throughout his tavern, effectively casting *misty step* three times in succession and gaining invisibility for 1 minute.

## Equipment
- **Hidden Blade** (+1 dagger with poison reservoir)
- **Studded Leather Armor +2** (appears as ordinary clothing)
- **Cloak of Elvenkind** (helps with stealth and information gathering)
- **Boots of the Wall Walker** (allows movement on walls and ceilings)
- **Ring of Mind Shielding** (protects his own thoughts from intrusion)
- **Crystal of Communication** (linked to his information network)
- **Truth Serum Collection** (various substances that encourage honesty)
- **Emergency Fund** (hidden caches of currency from multiple realms)

## Secrets & Motivations

### Hidden Truths (DM Only)
> [!warning] DM Secrets
> - **The False Neutrality**: While publicly neutral, Jasper secretly works to prevent war between the realms because he's seen visions of the apocalyptic destruction it would bring
> - **The Cosmic Patron**: His warlock pact isn't with a benevolent entity of knowledge—his patron is a cosmic horror that feeds on secrets and revelation
> - **The Death Vision**: He's seen his own death in multiple timelines and is desperately trying to change the outcome
> - **The Network's True Purpose**: His information network is actually designed to identify and track individuals with potential to become cosmic threats
> - **The Third Eye's Origin**: His mutation wasn't caused by magical accident but by deliberate exposure orchestrated by the cosmic entity
> - **The Memory Collection**: He's been storing copies of important memories and secrets in crystals as backup against his own potential death

### Primary Motivations
1. **Survival**: Stay alive and maintain his independence despite growing threats
2. **Knowledge**: Understand the cosmic forces that shaped him and threaten reality
3. **Prevention**: Use his position to prevent catastrophic conflicts and disasters
4. **Legacy**: Ensure his information network continues even if he doesn't

## Combat Tactics
Jasper avoids direct confrontation whenever possible, relying on information, negotiation, and environmental advantages. When forced to fight:

- **Information Warfare**: Uses his knowledge of opponents' secrets to demoralize and distract
- **Environmental Control**: Fights in his tavern where he has hidden weapons and escape routes
- **Psychological Manipulation**: Attacks confidence and morale rather than bodies when possible
- **Hit and Run**: Uses mobility and stealth to avoid prolonged combat
- **Last Resort**: Calls upon his patron's power for supernatural assistance

### Signature Moves
- **Secret Weapon**: Reveals damaging information mid-combat to turn enemies against each other
- **Third Eye Dominance**: Uses his supernatural sight to predict and counter enemy actions
- **Tavern Defense**: Activates hidden traps and defenses throughout his establishment
- **Information Hostage**: Threatens to release sensitive information unless opponents withdraw

## Adventure Hooks

1. **The Missing Network** - Several of Jasper's key informants have disappeared, and the remaining sources report contradictory information about the same events. Something is systematically dismantling his network.

2. **The Truth Plague** - A magical curse is forcing people to speak only the truth, threatening to reveal secrets that could destabilize both realms. Jasper needs help finding and stopping the source.

3. **The Blind Spot** - There's a location that Jasper's third eye cannot perceive, and disturbing reports are emerging from that area. He needs investigators who can see what he cannot.

4. **The Information War** - Two rival factions are bidding for the same piece of information that could change the balance of power. Jasper must decide whether to sell to the highest bidder or destroy the information entirely.

5. **The Cosmic Summons** - Jasper's patron is calling in its debt, demanding that he perform a service that would betray his neutrality and potentially doom one of the realms.

6. **The Perfect Crime** - Someone has committed a crime that even Jasper's supernatural sight cannot solve. His reputation is at stake unless he can uncover the truth behind this impossible mystery.

7. **The Prophecy Auction** - Jasper has received a vision of a great disaster, but the information is incomplete. He needs adventurers to help him gather the missing pieces before it's too late to prevent catastrophe.

8. **The Network Revolution** - His information sources have begun acting independently, pursuing their own agendas rather than reporting to him. Is this natural evolution or external manipulation?

## Roleplaying Notes

- "Everyone has secrets. The trick is knowing which ones are worth keeping."

## Plot Threads
Jasper Three-Eyes Flint serves as a perfect facilitator for complex political and supernatural plots while raising questions about the value of neutrality and the price of knowledge. He can be involved in numerous plot threads:
- Information warfare between competing factions
- The ethics of neutrality in times of moral crisis
- Supernatural mutation and the price of cosmic knowledge
- The balance between personal survival and greater good
- The complex web of loyalties that binds information networks together

His character represents the theme that knowledge is power, but power always comes with responsibility and dangerous consequences. He's simultaneously indispensable and dangerous, trustworthy within his strict parameters and completely unreliable outside them.
