The party investigates [Whisper Island]], discovering [[Captain Blackwater's crystallized ship and a lighthouse conducting horrific resoce experiments. They uncover references to "[Seven Shards]] of the [[Deep God" and disrupt a ritual attempting to "call something from below," experiencing a shared vision of a vast underwater city. ### [Opening Scene]]

**Location:** [[[Whisper Island Docks]]
**Time:** Dawn, heavy fog
**Description:**

The party's boat cuts through unnatural fog thick as wool. Crystalline formations jut from the water like frozen lightning, scraping against the hull. Through the mist, the Seahawk emerges - a [[Meridian Navy ship half-consumed by purple crystal growth, frozen mid-scream. A figure in red robes watches from the lighthouse peak, then vanishes. **Environmental:** - Fog provides heavy obscurement
- Crystal formations deal `dice: 1d6` damage on contact
- Strange whispers in unknown language (**DC 13** Wisdom save or frightened 1 minute) #### Event 1: [The Crystallized]] Ship

**Location:** [[[The Seahawk]]
**NPCs:** None ([[Crystal Mimics disguised as equipment)
**Outcome:**
- [Explore Captain]] Blackwater's abandoned vessel
- Main deck shows crystallized crew frozen mid-scream
- Captain's cabin has hidden compartment (Investigation **DC 15**)
- Find journal detailing "[[Seven Shards of the [Deep God]]"
- Crystal mimics attack when investigating cargo **[[Key Discovery:** Journal entry: "The seven shards aren't weapons - they're a prison. Something sleeps beneath the waves, and the crystals are its dreams made manifest." #### Event 2: [The Keeper]]'s House

**Location:** [[[Lighthouse Keeper]]
**NPCs:** [[[[Jasper Three [Eyes Flint]]]]
**Outcome:**
- [[Find Jasper hiding, partially crystallized (30% transformed)
- He's paranoid but has vital information
- Persuasion **DC 14** to calm him, **DC 18** for full cooperation
- Reveals lighthouse was conducting "resoce experiments"
- Mentions seeing "things swimming in the air" when crystals activate **Jasper's Revelation:** "They're not creating the plague... They're tuning it! Like a conductor with an orchestra of crystals. [The Queen]]'s seal was on the orders, but dated next month. How is that possible?" #### Event 3: [[The Lighthouse Ascent

**Location:** [[Lighthouse_of_Storms|01 Campaigns/Aethermoor/Locations/[Lighthouse Of]] Storms]] - Multiple floors
**NPCs:** [[Infected Experiments (hostile)
**Outcome:**
- **[Ground Floor]]:** Ruined laboratory, broken containment circles - Investigation reveals [[Crimson Hand and [Royal Seal]] markings
- **[[Second Floor:** Living quarters showing progression into madness - Diary entries become increasingly incoherent
- **[Third Floor]]:** Library with burnt books - Some salvageable research notes about "harmonic frequencies"
- **Encounters:** Infected experiments attack on second floor **[[Environmental Challenge:** Each floor closer to peak increases corruption (CON save **DC 12** + floor number or gain 1 exposure) #### Event 4: [The Resoce]] Chamber

**Location:** [[[[Lighthouse Peak [Resoce Chamber]]|01 Campaigns/Aethermoor/Locations/[[Lighthouse Peak [Resoce Chamber]]]]
**NPCs:** [[[Vex Shadowthorn's Apprentices]] (2)
**Outcome:**
- Massive 20-foot crystal formation pulsing with energy
- Apprentices conducting ritual to "call the [[Deep God"
- Can attempt to reason (Persuasion **DC 20**) or fight
- Disrupting ritual triggers vision sequence
- [[[The Crimson]] Sage]] appears briefly to help if needed ### [[The Shared Vision

When the ritual is disrupted, everyone experiences:

> *You're falling... No, sinking. The world inverts. Below becomes above. You see a vast city of impossible architecture - spires that grow downward, water that flows upward, streets that exist in multiple dimensions simultaneously. Thousands of crystallized figures are arranged in prayer formation. A voice speaks in your minds, not in words but in pure meaning: "[The Seventh]] Shard awakens. [[The Drowned God stirs. The surface world's time grows short."* ### [Closing Scene]]

**Location:** [[[Lighthouse Keeper]]
**Cliffhanger:**

The party awakens from the vision to find three days have passed. Jasper is gone, leaving only a note: "They know you're here now. Both of them - the thing below and the one who wears the crown. The city prepares for war with itself. Trust the Sage, fear the Queen, find the Seven before the Festival. PS - I took one shard. Safer with me running than you fighting." ### Combat
