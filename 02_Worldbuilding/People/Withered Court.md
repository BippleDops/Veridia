# Withered Court

*Where ancient nobility clings to power beyond death's embrace*

## Overview

The **Withered Court** stands as one of [[Aethermoor]]'s most enigmatic and dangerous political entities - a necrocracy of undead aristocrats who refuse to relinquish their ancestral claims to power. Located in the [[Shadowlands]] region, their seat of power is the magnificent yet terrifying **Ossuary Palace**, a structure built from the bones of thousands and animated by the collective will of generations of deceased nobles.

This undead aristocracy emerged during the [[Great Dying]], when a cabal of nobles used forbidden [[Necromantic Rituals]] to preserve their consciousness beyond death rather than face the dissolution of their bloodlines. Now they exist as various forms of undead, from elegant [[Liches]] and regal [[Vampires]] to more exotic forms like [[Bone Princes]] and [[Wraith Duchesses]].

## Political Structure & Territory

The Withered Court operates as a feudal hierarchy where death is merely another form of elevation in rank. Their territory encompasses the [[Bleakmoore Estates]], the [[Crypt Gardens]], and the notorious [[Valley of Eternal Mourning]]. Living subjects serve alongside undead retainers, creating a bizarre society where the dead literally rule over the living.

### The Ossuary Palace

The Court's seat of power is an architectural marvel of macabre beauty. Constructed entirely from consecrated bones, the palace exists in multiple dimensions simultaneously - visitors might find themselves in grand ballrooms filled with ghostly dancers or trapped in bone-walled libraries where the books scream when opened. The throne room, known as the **Chamber of Final Judgments**, is where the Court Eternal makes decisions that affect both the living and dead across [[Aethermoor]].

## Atmosphere & Culture

The Withered Court maintains many of the customs and ceremonies of living nobility, but twisted through the lens of undeath. They host elaborate **Death Masques** where both living and dead dance until dawn, conduct **SÃ©ance Salons** for diplomatic discourse with spirits, and practice **Blood Sports** where the entertainment often proves literally fatal for participants.

The air throughout their domain carries the perpetual scent of funeral flowers and embalming spices, while [[Phantom Orchestras]] provide haunting melodies that can be heard echoing across the moors. The Court values tradition, bloodline purity, and the accumulation of both temporal power and spiritual essence.

6. **Diplomatic Immunity**: The characters must attend a formal court function where assassination attempts, political intrigue, and supernatural dangers threaten from every shadow. Can they navigate the deadly etiquette of the undead aristocracy?

## Relationships & Conflicts

The Withered Court maintains tense relationships with most living nations in [[Aethermoor]], particularly the [[Temple Coalition]] and [[Rangers of the Living Dawn]] who view them as abominations to be destroyed. However, they have surprising diplomatic ties with the [[Shadow Merchants Guild]], [[Necromancer's Conclave]], and even some pragmatic members of the [[Arcane Assembly]].

Their greatest enemies are the [[Purification Order]], [[Living Alliance]], and the mysterious [[Death Hunters Guild]] who specialize in permanently destroying powerful undead. The Court also faces internal conflicts between different factions of undead nobility, each representing different approaches to their eternal existence.

## Connections

Their influence extends through the [[Shadow Network]], connections to various [[Undead Enclaves]], and ancient treaties with forgotten kingdoms.
