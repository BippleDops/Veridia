# Druidcraft (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
These are new variants of the spell *druidcraft* that appears in the *Player’s Handbook*, pg.236

♦ You perfectly mimic one animal or bird call.

♦ You place a magical mark on an object such as a rock or tree to mark a path or tell a message such as “danger: beasts” or “fresh water.” This mark is very subtle and causes no harm whatsoever, and lasts until you dis-pel it.

♦ You instantly make an unripe fruit ripen.

♦ You command one beast of CR 0. The command must be of no more than two words (“sit,” “attack him”).

♦ You heal a Tiny plant.
