# Breads
## Overview
If wine is the nectar of the gods, bread is their staple meal. Every people across Toril has its own bread, from the nomadic Bedine of Anauroch to the exotic folk of Nexal. In my years of adventuring, I tasted many of these breads, typically without the time to get recipes or even pack away a rucksackful. Therefore, when I began my merchandising business, I immediately set up lines to sell many of the exotic and wonderful breads I had tasted in my travels. Here they are, with stories (where appropriate) of how I first encountered them.
