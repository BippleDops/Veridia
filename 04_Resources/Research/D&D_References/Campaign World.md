--- # Campaign World *"Two realms, one destiny - where surface dreams meet depths of reality."* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview The campaign world consists of two interconnected yet fundamentally different realms: Aethermoor, the surface world of sky-touching cities and wind-swept plains, and Aquabyssos, the underwater domain of pressure-forged architecture and current-carved caverns. These realms exist in a delicate balance, connected by magical portals, political intrigue, and the shared fate of their inhabitants who must navigate an increasingly complex relationship between surface and sea. What makes this world unique is not just the dual-realm nature, but the active, ongoing interaction between the two domains. Unlike typical fantasy settings where different planes remain largely separate, Aethermoor and Aquabyssos are intimately connected through trade, diplomacy, conflict, and the mysterious forces that threaten both realms simultaneously. ## Historical Background The two realms originally existed as separate dimensions until a cataclysmic magical event known as the Great Convergence caused their barriers to weaken and overlap. This event, occurring approximately 800 years ago, was initially seen as a disaster as it caused massive environmental upheavals in both worlds. However, over time, the connection proved beneficial, leading to unprecedented magical and technological advancement. The early period following marked convergence confusion, conflict, and gradual understanding. Surface dwellers discovered they were not alone, while underwater civilizations learned of a vast world above their oceanic domain. The establishment of formal diplomatic relations took centuries, with both realms learning to navigate the complex challenges of inter-dimensional politics. ## Current State The campaign world currently faces an era of unprecedented challenge and opportunity. Political tensions between various factions in both realms create a complex web of alliances and conflicts. Meanwhile, mysterious phenomena - including corruption effects, dimensional instabilities, and the awakening of ancient powers - threaten the stability of both domains. Characters find themselves at the center of these converging crises, with their actions potentially determining the fate of both realms. The world is rich with adventure opportunities, from diplomatic missions and exploration to combat encounters and mystery-solving. ### Aquabyssos

The underwater realm has developed a sophisticated society adapted to three-dimensional living and the constant presence of pressure and current. Politics flow like water, with power structures that can shift rapidly. Magic tends to be fluid and adaptive, reflecting the oceanic environment. Architecture and art emphasize organic curves and pressure-resistant design. ### Aethermoor

The surface world maintains more traditional fantasy elements but transformeded by contact with Aquabyssos. Cities now incorporate water-management systems learned from underwater engineers, while magical practices blend surface and aquatic traditions. Society tends to be more structured and hierarchical than its underwater counterpart. ### Duration

The campaign world represents an ongoing, evolving setting where character actions have lasting consequences across both realms. Changes made in one domain often affect the other, creating ripple effects that can span entire story arcs. ## Adventure Hooks 1. **Realm Stabilization**: Characters work to prevent dimensional barriers from collapsing completely

2. **Cultural Ambassador**: Serve as diplomatic representatives facilitating peace between factions
3. **Ancient Secrets**: Investigate ruins and artifacts that predate the Convergence ## Secrets (DM Only) The Great Convergence was actually triggered by an ancient entity attempting to merge all possible worlds into one reality under its control. This entity remains dormant but is slowly awakening, and the increasing instabilities in both realms are signs of its growing influence. ## Campaign Use The dual-realm nature of the campaign world provides endless opportunities for adventure variety. Use the contrast between environments to challenge players in different ways, while the interconnected nature ensures that all adventures feel meaningful to the larger world. The political complexity provides rich roleplay opportunities, while the environmental challenges offer unique combat and exploration scenarios. ## Player-Facing Summary Campaign World is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Campaign World as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Campaign World. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Plot Hooks - Strange disappearances suggest a portal
