- **Setup** (20% of horror sequence): Establish normal baseline
- **Disturbance** (30% of horror sequence): Introduce anomalous elements
- **Escalation** (35% of horror sequence): Compound threats and reduce options
- **Climax** (10% of horror sequence): Peak horror revelation or encounter
- **Aftermath** (5% of horror sequence): Deal with consequences and trauma **Recovery and Release**:
