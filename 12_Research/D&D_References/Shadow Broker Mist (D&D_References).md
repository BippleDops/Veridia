## Overview
Known only as "Mist," this enigmatic figure operates in the liminal spaces between light and shadow throughout [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]. More shadow than flesh after years of bonding with umbral entities, she trades in the most dangerous commodity of all: secrets. Unlike [[Jasper "Three Eyes" Flint|02 Worldbuilding/People/Jasper "Three Eyes" Flint]]'s crude information brokerage, Mist deals in secrets that can topple governments, destroy lives, or grant impossible power. Her true identity, origins, and even physical form remain mysteries that have confounded investigators for years.

## Secrets
> [!warning] DM Only
> - Was once a surface world noble named Lady Evangeline Blackmere
> - Bonded with shadows to survive assassination attempt, lost most humanity
> - Knows the true identity of several major NPCs in both realms
> - Has stolen memories from the [[Deep Mother|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/Deep Mother]]'s dreams
> - Maintains a secret alliance with surface world shadow organizations
> - Her shadow nature is slowly consuming her - she's running out of time
> - The violet eyes are actually trapped souls of her first victims

## Motivations
1. **Primary**: Accumulate secrets and power to control both realms
2. **Secondary**: Survive her shadow transformation without losing all humanity
3. **Hidden**: Revenge against surface nobles who tried to kill her original self
4. **Long-term**: Become powerful enough to negotiate directly with the [[Deep Mother|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/Deep Mother]]

## Quest Hooks
1. Offers crucial information about main quest - for a terrible price
2. One of her agents has gone rogue with dangerous secrets
3. Blackmailing party member with information from their past
4. Needs protection while she retrieves memories from dangerous source
5. Competition with [[Jasper "Three Eyes" Flint|02 Worldbuilding/People/Jasper "Three Eyes" Flint]] requires outside adjudication

## Speaking Style
*"Information, dear client, is the only true currency. Everything else is merely... negotiable."* - To potential clients

*"I know what you did in the sunlit world. The question is: what will you pay to keep it buried in shadow?"* - Blackmail approach

*"Shadows remember what light forgets. I am shadow, therefore I am memory incarnate."* - Philosophical observation
