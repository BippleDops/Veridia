# Stealth & Ambush

How it feels
- Low lights, quiet crew, sudden bursts of speed

What changes in travel
- Harder to spot enemies; easier to disengage
- Ambushes favored in fog, silt, dust, and flickers

Crew tips
- Sensor lead calls out lanes
- Helm threads cover; gunnery holds fire until it matters

Risks
- If caught, youâ€™re up close and already moving
