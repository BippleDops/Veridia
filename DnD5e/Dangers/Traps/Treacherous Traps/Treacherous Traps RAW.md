The definitive guide to creating traps, hazards, and puzzles

for your fantasy adventures

```
FOREWORD
A common misconception regarding traps is that their purpose is solely to inflict damage on characters. This is a very limited
view. A trap that is blundered into, goes off, injures a few characters, and then is forgotten can be a wasted opportunity. The
best traps are the ones that characters find and then spend time and brainpower trying to overcome in interesting ways, asking
questions like: Can it be disabled? If not, can it be circumvented? Can its effect be minimized?
One of our primary goals as storytellers is engagement, and traps can be an excellent tool for this! An adventuring party is
made up of players who all have fun in different ways. As diverse as our players can be, so too are their characters, with
different skills, proficiencies, and areas of expertise. Traps, when used well, can add to everyone’s experience. A trap can
allow a player to flex their roleplaying muscles or it can highlight a meticulously optimized character build. This book has
hundreds of examples of ways to challenge players. When using them, consider the things your players enjoy, and what
their characters can do, and use obstacles that play to these things. Be conscious of where they get invested, when they are
having fun, and how they react. Give everyone opportunities to contribute and to overcome the challenges laid before them.
This creates a satisfying experience for everyone.
This book is the culmination of thousands of hours of combined game-mastering experience and the wisdom that those
contributors have imparted to us. The traps and puzzles found herein are designed to fit many situations, but you will
certainly find some you enjoy more than others. Some may be perfect for your campaigns, while some will almost certainly
not be. Investigate, delve, and seek out those that are just the right fit for you. It is also our hope that as you read, you will
be inspired to create your own. Use this book as a guide and as a companion on the hazard-strewn path that is the craft of
trap-and-puzzle-making.
It is with those words that we send you forth into the cobwebbed corridors, neglected crypts, and warrens of the dark
unknown to find many hours of fun, tension, and excitement.
Warmest Regards and Happy Gaming,

Treacherous Traps is intended to be something you consult
regularly, as opposed to something you read “cover-to-
cover” (though you certainly could). It’s very unlikely that
you will need all the information in this book at once. Read
this chapter first. Then, to help you maximize your time and
efforts when accomplishing your goals, you can cherry-pick
through the book’s sections as needed. Here is a breakdown
of what you can expect in each chapter:
```
**- Chapter 1: Introduction and How to Use Traps.** This
    chapter breaks down the general philosophy of how
    to think about traps and other related subject matter.
    Detailed breakdowns of the topics in this chapter are
    found elsewhere in the book.
**- Chapter 2-6: Simple Traps.** These chapters are filled
    with pre-made simple traps. These are ready to be
    dropped into your game as they are, or with very little
    adaptation. Each chapter has 50 traps split into 5 levels of
    lethality (setback, moderate, dangerous, perilous, deadly),
    organized by level range (1-4, 5-8, 9-12, 13-16, 17-20).
**- Chapter 7: Complex Traps.** This chapter has 25 traps
    designed to be more elaborate than the simple traps.
    They feature multiple elements that trigger in stages and
    present a range of obstacles for character to overcome.
    There are 5 complex traps per level range (1-4, 5-8, 9-12,
    13-16, 17-20), one for each level of lethality (setback,
    moderate, dangerous, perilous, deadly).
       **- Chapter 8: Designing Traps.** This is the perfect place
          to start when making your own traps. In it there are
          general guidelines and best practices for trap design,
          tables that cover different variable elements of a trap,
          and suggested experience rewards if you choose to
          award experience for overcoming traps.
       **- Chapter 9: Random Trap Generator.** This chapter
          contains a table to help you create a simple randomized
          trap that you can adjust and implement to fit your needs.
          Below the random table are sections that cover each of
          the 50 triggers and 50 effects in detail.
       **- Chapter 10: Trap-Centric Dungeons.** This chapter
          contains some general thoughts about designing
          dungeons focused on or built primarily around traps, as
          well as a few examples of how to accommodate traps of
          different types within certain spaces or corridors.
       **- Chapter 11: Perplexing Puzzles.** This chapter contains
          brief guidelines on implementing puzzles and their
          solutions into your game. There are also 30 pre-made
          puzzles you can use in a variety of situations and settings.
          Almost all include tweaks and suggestions to alter their
          difficulty or customize them for your campaign.
       **- Chapter 12: Subtle Secrets.** This brief chapter contains
          a selection of story, quest, and environmental secrets
          that can be used in your campaign.
       **- Chapter 13: Ridiculous Riddles.** This brief chapter
          contains general guidelines regarding the creation of
          riddles, as well as some example riddles.
       **- Chapter 14: Trapsmith Legends.** This brief chapter
          introduces a new player background, the Trapsmith,
          who begins their journey with a new kind of tool:
          trapsmith tools. The chapter also includes 3 NPCs with
          the Trapsmith background who specialize in creating
          and disarming traps. These Trapsmith Legends can be
          hired to accompany characters on their journey and
          come complete with stats for easy reference.


Chapter One | How to Use Traps 5

HOW TO USE TRAPS

In either case, before you charge over and begin perusing the
vast selection of ways in which you can hamper, harangue,
and otherwise haze the poor characters about to encounter
them, it is a good idea to understand the very basics of how
and why traps work as they do.

T E

The traps in the following chapters will always contain the
following elements:

- The type of trap (mechanical, magic, or hybrid)
- The trap’s level range, lethality, and any purpose
    keywords.
- A description of the trap, providing its general layout
    and position.
**_- Trigger (Random Table Entry)_**. This is what triggers the
    trap. We’ve also noted what entry from Chapter 9 was
    used to make this trap, to give you an idea of how to use
    the triggers from that chapter.
       **_- Effect (Random Table Entry)_**. This is what happens when
          the trigger conditions are met. Again, there’s a reference
          to the table in Chapter 9. Most of the time, trap effects
          require a saving throw or make an attack roll and have
          instantaneous results. But if there are lingering effects
          that characters can deal with, information about that is
          listed here.
       **_- Countermeasures (Trait)._** Options for what characters
          can do to find, notice, or disarm the trap are provided in
          this section. If the trap has any traits (like **difficult** or
          **sensitive** ) those are noted here.

```
T T	
In the following chapters, you will find traps in 3 categories:
```
**- Mechanical.** These are traps where the trigger and
    effect are both mundane.
**- Magic.** These are traps where the trigger and effect are
    both magic, and are usually spell traps.
**- Hybrid.** These are traps where the either the trigger is
    magic and the effect is mundane, or vice versa.


6 Chapter One | How to Use Traps

```
S T
Many of the magic and hybrid traps described in this book
could be a glyph of warding (spell trap) or the symbol spell. These
spells each have their own specific rules for detection and
disarming. A glyph of warding or symbol can only be found
with an Intelligence (Investigation) check, using the caster’s
spell save DC, and can only be disabled with dispel magic. You
can use the DC determined by the trap’s lethality, or if you
know that an NPC wizard cast the spell you can use their
spell save DC.
As an optional rule you can allow a character to use a
successful Intelligence (Arcana) check to disable a glyph of
warding or symbol as well as dispel magic. When we present
these kinds of traps throughout this book, we assume that
this optional rule is in effect.
Whether or not creatures can use Investigation passively
is up to you; if you decide to allow for passive Investigation
to discover a glyph of warding that can make them less
threatening. However, if a glyph can only be found with
an active check, you might consider allowing for a Wisdom
(Perception) check or leaving some clues in the trapped area
to let the characters know that something might be hidden.
```
```
H	 T
These kinds of traps combine mundane triggers and magic
effects, or magic triggers and mundane effects, and this can
lead to some interesting combinations. Hybrid traps can
usually be detected with Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence
(Arcana), and they can also be found with detect magic.
When a mundane trigger activates a magic effect, the trapped
area or object is enchanted with a spell effect but just waiting
for input from the trigger to complete the arcane circuit.
When activated, the trap targets the creature that triggered it
with the effect. If the trap affects an area, the area is centered
on that creature. If the trap summons hostile creatures or
creates harmful objects, they appear as close as possible to the
triggering and attack it. If the effect requires concentration, it
lasts until the end of its full duration.
When viewed with detect magic , this kind of hybrid traps
usually have an aura that reflects the school of magic for
the effect. A trap that creates a blast of fire usually shows up
with an evocation aura when looked at with detect magic.
```
```
If a magic trigger activates a mechanical effect, the trap
usually has some sort of rune or sigil that acts as a detector.
When activated, the rune creates a Tiny, invisible, mindless,
shapeless force that only lasts long enough to interact
with the mechanical elements of the trap, setting off the
mundane effect. If you’d like, you can add the following
spell to your game to provide a way for spellcasters (usually
sorcerers and wizards, or clerics of deities devoted to
protection) to make these sorts of detectors.
Rune of Detecting
2nd-level abjuration (ritual)
Casting Time: 1 hour
Range: Touch
Components: V, S, M (incense and powdered precious
metals worth at least 50 gp, which the spell consumes)
Duration: Until dispelled or triggered
When you cast this spell, you inscribe a rune upon a surface
(such as a table or a section of floor or wall), or on an object.
If you choose a surface, the rune can cover an area of the
surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an
object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is
moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the
rune burns away, and the spell ends without being triggered.
You can hide the rune in a larger design, but the rune
is visible and can be spotted with a successful Wisdom
(Perception) check. With a successful Intelligence (Arcana)
check, a creature that spots the rune can erase a portion of it,
ending the spell without triggering it. The DC for both these
checks is your spell save DC.
You decide what triggers the rune when you cast the spell.
For rune inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers
include touching or standing on the rune , removing another
object covering the rune, approaching within a certain
distance of the rune, or manipulating the object on which
the runeis inscribed. For glyphs inscribed on an object, the
most common triggers include approaching within a certain
distance of the object, or seeing or reading the rune.
You can further refine the trigger so the rune activates
only under certain circumstances or according to physical
characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind
(for example, the ward could be set to affect aberrations
or drow), or alignment. You can also set conditions for
creatures that don’t trigger the rune, such as those who say a
certain password.
When the rune is triggered, it creates a Tiny, invisible,
mindless, shapeless force that only lasts long enough to
interact with a nearby mechanical element, such as the
workings of a trap, a lever, or a button. The mechanical
element must be within 10 feet of the rune. Once the force
interacts in this way, the spell ends and the rune fades away.
```

Chapter One | How to Use Traps 7

T L & L	

The pre-made traps in this book are arranged by level and
lethality. These are used together to determine things such as
the variables of the trap, such as appropriate damage output,
spell level, duration of effects, and (if needed) appropriate
experience reward.

**_Level_**_._ A trap’s level is expressed as one of five ranges: 1-4,
5-8, 9-12, 13-16, and 17-20. An appropriate trap will be in the
range that includes the average level of your characters.

**_Lethality_**_._ Variable statistics of a given trap, such as attack
bonus, the DC for a saving throw to resist its effects or
an ability check to overcome it, and the damage it deals
all depend on the trap’s lethality. A trap intended to be
a **setback** is unlikely to seriously harm characters of
the indicated levels, but a **moderate** trap likely will. A
**dangerous** trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially
kill) characters of the indicated levels and a **perilous**
trap almost definitely will. A **deadly** trap is likely to kill
characters of the indicated levels.

T P

A trap’s purpose keyword describes its primary usage in
the area, including the reasoning behind its placement and
the overall goal of the trap. Some traps may do more than
one of the following, but their primary purpose is reflected
in the keyword.

**- Alert.** These traps notify someone or something to the
    presence intruders. The alert need not only in the form
    of a sound.
**- Block.** These traps impede creatures from proceeding
    in a particular direction. The trap could stand in the
    way of multiple avenues, not only one. It could also
    prevent retreat.
**- Harm.** Traps intended to cause damage or possibly kill
    creatures have this keyword.
**- Hinder.** These kinds of traps disable or hamper
    creatures, damaging their senses or imposing
    conditions.
**- Subdue.** A trap that captures creatures alive, either
    by containing them physically or with magic, has this
    keyword.

```
T  E
A trap is easily thought of as an “if/then” statement: “If this
happens, then that happens.” This means that the most basic
components of a trap are its trigger and its effect. Every trap
has at least one of each.
Triggers come in all shapes and sizes. They can be as basic
as a tripwire strung across a path, but they can be more
complex, such as a weight-sensitive floor which only
activates when a certain amount of weight, or more, is
placed on it. Triggers come in three varieties:
```
**- Mundane.** The trigger has some sort of mechanical
    apparatus or it relies on things like gravity and
    momentum.
**- Ambiguous.** The trigger could be created using
    mundane or magical means and functions respectively
    (i.e., a “wrong key” trap could detect a wrong key using
    internal pins and mechanisms, or simply with an arcane
    enchantment).
**- Magic.** The trigger functions purely by magical means.
No matter the type, all triggers share a common trait: if their
requirements are met, they activate.
Effects come in the same three varieties that triggers do:
**- Mundane.** The effect functions via mechanical means,
or relies on things such as gravity or momentum. No
part of the effect is magical (fire comes from a natural
source, real rocks fall down, etc).
**- Ambiguous.** The effect could be created using mundane
or magical means and functions respectively (i.e., poison
gas could start filling the room, but the gas could be
created with either chemicals or magic).
**- Magic.** The effect is created purely with magic.
No matter the type, all effects share a common trait, if their
trigger is activated, the effect occurs.

```
C
No one likes being hit with something they had no chance to
see coming. When it comes to traps, it is important to always
know what the characters can do to detect elements of the
trap. Each trap entry will provide options like:
```
- Ability checks to notice elements of the trap.
- If necessary, ability checks to understand how the trap
    works and how to disable it.
- Different ways in which the creatures involved can slow,
    stop, or otherwise interfere with the trigger or effect.
Not all trap triggers can be detected in the same ways, and
some can be more difficult to detect than others. A trigger
housed within the doorjamb of a closed door is very difficult
to find, but a pressure plate might be much easier to spot.


8 Chapter One | How to Use Traps

```
DETECTING TRIGGERS
The following are some concepts to consider when it comes
to how characters detect traps in your game.
Alternative Skill Usage. There may be times when using
a skill with an unorthodox ability may be appropriate,
depending on the task. Consider the situation and your
players’ levels of creativity to determine whether doing
something like this would be appropriate. Some tables also
allow for something called the “Rule of Cool”; the the GM
will allow something that the system typically does not,
simply because it makes the game more fun or adds to the
situation in a way that makes for a better experience.
Immersion. Have players describe what senses their
characters are using to detect traps, instead of simply listing
the skills they have on their character sheet. This can help
engage the players and paint a more vivid picture of the
scene in their mind’s eye. Try to be aware of each creature’s
passive Perception. If a character or creature has a passive
Perception high enough to notice certain elements of the
trap, be sure to let them know without forcing them to roll.
More information about this is in Chapter 9.
Timing. Think about how much time is passing as the
characters find and deal with traps. Even though it may only
take a few minutes of real-world time, it may have been
hours or even days in game time (or vice versa).
Too Many Rolls. Don’t just let every player roll dice until
someone detects and/or disarms the trap. Have the players
describe, with some specifics, how they are attempting to
detect or disarm the trap. This can slow things down just
enough to add a bit of tension and get the players thinking,
instead of just rolling until they win. Also consider that
it rarely makes sense for every character to take turns
attempting to disarm a trap. This is especially true if someone
particularly suited to the task has already failed. Instead,
characters can use things like the Help action, class features
like Bardic Inspiration, or spells like guidance. This will allow
most everyone to participate, even if there is a specialist.
Trap Clues. If you’re designing or including traps that relate
to the overall story of your campaign, such as a ritual or
important location within the dungeon, make sure to leave
clues sprinkled throughout the rest of your adventure. If the
players get their characters to this important spot and have
no idea how to prevent a deadly trap, then it’s not going to be
very fun springing it on them unexpectedly. However, if they
arrive armed with at least some information about the trap
(how to detect it, or at least how to survive it) the experience
will be far more memorable for all involved. You can also
throw out subtle clues to trap triggers or effects, such as an
odd smell, things out of place, or marks on the walls. How
much information you put in your clue will impact what
your players immediately decide to do.
Trap Lore. In some cases a trap’s trigger or effect may be
extremely difficult to detect. It may be appropriate to use
an Intelligence (History, Nature, or Religion) check in order
to reveal lore about the trap and its location within the
surrounding area.
```
```
DISARMING TRIGGERS
Once a trigger has been detected, it usually needs to be
disarmed (unless it can simply be avoided, such as a
tripwire). Depending on the type of trap, disarming tends to
work in different ways.
Mundane. Mundane triggers, or ambiguous triggers that
are being used as mundane, are usually disarmed with a
successful Dexterity check while using thieves' tools or
trapsmiths’ tools. The main objective when disarming a trap
is to do so without accidentally setting it off.
Magic. Magic triggers, or ambiguous triggers used as magic
ones, are usually disarmed with dispel magic. In the following
chapters, if a trap can be disabled this way and the spell
effect would be 4th level or higher, the DC for the dispel magic
ability check is noted. If there is no DC provided, the spell
effect is 3rd level or lower.
Sometimes a magic trigger can be disarmed by erasing a rune
on the wall or otherwise disrupting the magic of the trap. A
successful Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) check can disable
a magic trap in this way, or reveal how it might be done.
Optionally, another method could be allowing a spellcaster to
make a spellcasting ability check to disarm a magic trap with
intuitive knowledge of a small burst of magic.
Encourage players to be creative when dealing with traps.
They may come up with a way of disabling or circumventing
a trap that is not listed in the trap’s entry. It’s up to you to
determine if this method could work, and what rolls or
actions are required.
When players think outside the box to disarm or avoid a
trap, consider rewarding them with something they can
use later. This will help encourage players to bring their
creativity to the table. Granting Inspiration or advantage
on the character’s next trap-related roll can be great
motivation.
Some traps are rigged to activate on a failed attempt to
disarm them, no matter the result of the ability check,
while other traps are only triggered if the final result is
particularly low. A critical failure (rolling a natural 1) when
disarming a trap may result in additional hardships, at your
discretion.
If a character has encountered a particular type of trap
before, then they may gain advantage when it comes to
dealing with that kind of trap. If they have been successful
in dealing with a particular trap (or type of trap) in
meaningful ways, they could slowly move toward gaining a
bonus to disarming traps of that type. This is something that
the player would need to keep track of on their character
sheet, but it could be a realistic way to mechanically
represent expertise. Characters that have dealt with a kind
of trap many times could get advantage or a bonus die (such
as a d4 or d6) to roll when making ability checks to detect or
disarm that kind of trap.
```

Chapter One | How to Use Traps 9

DETECTING EFFECTS

Sometimes a trap’s effect stands out more than its trigger.
In any case, detection still often uses the same skills as when
detecting triggers, though a few more skills become relevant.
Wisdom (Perception) accounts for the five senses and can
be used actively or passively. Depending on the effect, other
applicable skills are Intelligence (Arcana, History, and
Religion). And for magic effects, there is always _detect magic_.

Not all trap effects are hidden. Sometimes a nasty wall of
spikes or a pendulum blade hanging from the ceiling in plain
sight is enough to stop intruders in their tracks.

DISABLING EFFECTS

Sometimes the only option to deal with a trap is to disable
or negate its effects. Wedging climbing pitons between
the cracks of a trapdoor, packing dart holes with wooden
dowels, or affixing a bag of holding to the water inlet of
a flooding chamber are all ways to negate a trap’s effects
instead of disarming it’s trigger.

```
R
When designing or placing a trap, it is important to consider
whether the trap would be able to reset itself or not.
Mechanical traps may or may not reset, depending on
the elements of the trap itself. Very basic traps, such as
a tripwire or a leaf-covered pit break or fall apart when
activated. On the other hand, something like swinging
blades attached to a pressure plate may reset, depending on
how well-engineered its internal mechanisms are.
Magic traps may reset depending on the parameters of the
trap. A glyph of warding spell trap only casts a spell once, but a
room enchanted to consistently affect a type of creature does
so until dispelled or disarmed.
Hybrid traps factor in mechanical and magic elements,
so may or may not reset based on the design of their
component elements.
Complex traps usually reset automatically after a period of
time, whether with magic or by mechanical means.
```
```
Traps as Templates
The pre-generated traps in the following chapters are
designed to be as usable in multiple settings and situations,
but there is no reason that you cannot make changes to them
to suit your needs. Some of the traps may have slight bits
of flavor, mentions of certain detection criteria, or other
elements that are specific about one thing or another. These
can be easily changed. For example, a trap could describe a
room decorated with tapestries of dwarven war victories,
with a magic trigger that activates whenever an elf walks into
the room. Instead, you could change this trap to be set in a
forest clearing with trees carved to depict elven war victories,
with a magic trigger that activates whenever a dwarf enters
the clearing.

e were heading to a centuries-old abandoned
temple deep in the jungle. The whole place
has been swallowed up by vines, lichen, and
saplings. The trail we chose was well used,
but as we got deeper into the jungle, it got uncomfortably
narrow. Scattered throughout the undergrowth were vestiges
of strange shrines and crudely constructed altars made of
stone, wood, and animal parts.
It bears mentioning that, given the unnerving nature of all
this,  not to mention the admonishments from the locals
that went something like “don’t visit the temple,” and “you
could be taken captive by ancient sorceries,” and “you’ll
surely perish,”  we were a bit on edge. Our ranger, keenly
interested by the shrines and altars, inspected them but
could not discern their purpose. That doesn’t mean they
didn’t have one.
Of course, per usual, our big barbarian took the lead because
should an axe, spear, or wave of arrows fly at us, it's better to
have someone up front who can take it. Myself and the ranger

were behind him and the cleric and wizard were at the back,
discussing the artifact we were looking for, thoughts about
the temple, and what challenges might lie inside.
So there we were, walking down this dense, green, throat of
a path through the jungle when I noticed something. A little
play of light near the ground caught my eye, and there before
my eyes was a tripwire. And sure enough, just as I realized
what I was seeing, the big man’s foot ran right into it...
Who needs a rogue when you’ve got a barbarian that
“detects traps”?
The traps in this chapter are designed to challenge characters
who are levels 1-4 and are grouped by their lethality. Any
of these traps can be dropped right into a dungeon or
similar adventure and shouldn’ t require any preparation.

12 Chapter Two | Level 1-4 Traps

```
R  F B
Hybrid trap (level 1-4, setback, harm)
A magic rune is inscribed on the wall, floor, or ceiling.
Trigger (Activate Rune). A creature that gets within 20 feet
of the rune triggers the trap.
Effect (Elemental Blast). When triggered, the rune activates
a hidden nozzle that emits a blast of fire, making a ranged
attack against the triggering creature. The attack has a +
attack bonus and deals 5 (1d10) fire damage. This attack can’t
gain advantage or disadvantage.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the rune, and a creature that succeeds on a DC
10 Intelligence (Arcana) check knows how the rune works.
A creature next to the rune can disable it with a successful
Intelligence (Arcana) check, but getting that close would set
off the trap. Casting dispel magic on the rune makes it fade
away, disarming the trap.
```
```
H C
Mechanical trap (level 1-4, setback, harm)
A surface such as a wall or ceiling has visible openings on it,
such as cracks or another form of small space.
Trigger (Pressure Plate). A creature that gets within 10 feet
of the opening steps on a hidden pressure plate and triggers
the trap.
Effect (Bolt). The trap makes a ranged attack against
the triggering creature. The attack has a +5 attack bonus
and deals 4 (1d8) piercing damage. This attack can’t gain
advantage or disadvantage.
Countermeasures (Sensitive). A successful DC 10 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the pressure plate. The pressure
plate can be disabled with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check
using thieves’ tools, but a check with a total of 5 or lower
triggers the trap.
```
**NOOKS AND CRANNIES**

```
Someone with experience in dungeons or ancient ruins
might become all too familiar with what hidden dangers
can be housed within cracks or small gaps.
```
```
Level 1-4 Setback
These traps should present a minor inconvenience to
characters of this level range.
```
```
A O
Magic trap (level 1-4, setback, hinder)
Atop a shrine rests a copper bowl filled with gemstones.
Trigger (Offering). A creature that removes the offerings
from the bowl triggers the trap.
Effect (Aging). A pulse of necromantic energy emanates
from the bowl, aging the thief. The triggering creature
must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be
magically aged 1d10 years. If the roll is even, the creature
is made younger; if odd, it becomes older. This forced aging
can be undone with remove curse or more powerful magic.
Countermeasures. A creature can infer the importance of
the offerings with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Religion)
check, and detect magic reveals an aura of necromancy on the
bowl. Casting dispel magic on the bowl disables the trap.
```
```
R  A S
Hybrid trap (level 1-4, setback, harm)
A rune of detection is inscribed on the wall, floor, or ceiling.
Trigger (Creature Detector). A creature that gets within 20
feet of the rune triggers the trap.
Effect (Acid/Slime Blast). When triggered, the rune activates
a hidden nozzle which sprays a jet of acid, making a ranged
attack against the triggering creature, and 1 additional
creature within 5 feet of the triggering creature. The attack
has a +5 attack bonus and deals 3 (1d6) acid damage. This
attack can’t gain advantage or disadvantage.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the rune, and a creature that succeeds on a DC
10 Intelligence (Arcana) check knows how the rune works.
A creature next to the rune can disable it with a successful
Intelligence (Arcana) check, but getting that close would set
off the trap. Casting dispel magic on the rune makes it fade
away, disarming the trap.
```

Chapter Two | Level 1-4 Traps 13

```
P S	 S
Hybrid trap (level 1-4, setback, harm)
A small, alluring statue with glittering gems beckons
adventurers to inspect it. The statue could be a snake
with emerald eyes, a monkey with diamonds for teeth,
or a dragon with a ruby in its mouth. A rune of detecting is
inscribed somewhere on the statue.
Trigger (Creature Detector). A creature gets within 5 feet of
the statue triggers the trap.
Effect (Elemental Blast). A noxious gas suddenly erupts
from somewhere on the statue (mouth, nose, ears, etc). The
triggering creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving
throw, taking 6 (1d12) poison damage on a failed save, or half
as much on a successful one.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)
check lets a creature spot the rune. A creature that succeeds on
a DC 10 Intelligence (History) check recognizes the statue and
knows about the trap. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana)
check or casting dispel magic on the statue disables the trap.
```
```
S S
Hybrid trap (level 1-4, setback, block)
A unique and ornate seal is carved into the floor of this
room; a rune of detection is hidden in the design of the seal.
Trigger (Pass Area). A creature that walks over the seal
activates the rune, which activates a timed mechanism. After
1 minute, the trap effect occurs. The GM can set specific
criteria for what activates the rune.
Effect (Barrier). A heavy stone slab or metal portcullis slams
down in the entrance to the room.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)
check lets a creature spot the rune, and a creature that
succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (History or Religion) check
recognizes the seal and knows about the trap. A successful
DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check or casting dispel magic on
the rune disables the trap.
```
F N

_Mechanical trap (level 1-4, setback, subdue)_

An interesting object in the area, such as a chest or a large
gem, is bait for this trap. A large net of thick hempen ropes
is hidden above the object, waiting to drop.

**_Trigger (Tension Cable)_**. The object is attached to a tension
cable; moving the object triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Net)_**. The trap releases a net onto all creatures in
a 10-foot radius, centered on the object. Creatures in the
area must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. A creature
that fails the saving throw is trapped under the net and
restrained, while creatures that succeed avoid the net. A
creature restrained by the net can use its action to make a DC
10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within
its reach on a success.

The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing
damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section
of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section. A glass
bottle is tied to the net, and it breaks when the net drops,
alerting nearby creatures when the net hits the floor.

**_Countermeasures._** A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the tension cable or hidden net. A successful
DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the cable,
but a check with a total of 5 or lower triggers the trap

F F

_Mechanical trap (level 1-4, setback, hinder)_

A finely crafted lock protects a door, chest, or other
container. The lock has a unique maker’s mark and appears
to be more complex than most.

**_Trigger (Pick Lock)_**. A creature that succeeds at picking the
lock, or opens the container without its key, triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Needle)_**. A hidden needle springs out, attacking the
triggering creature with a +5 attack bonus. If it hits, the
needle deals no damage but delivers a dose of stone hands
poison. This attack can’t gain advantage or disadvantage.

A creature exposed to stone hands poison must make a DC
10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3 (1d6)
poison damage and is poisoned for 1 hour. While poisoned in
this way, the creature automatically fails any ability checks
using Dexterity. On a successful save, the creature takes half
damage and isn’t poisoned.

**_Countermeasures_**_._ A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)
check lets a creature spot the mechanism attached to the
lock, and a creature that succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence
(History) check recognizes the maker’s mark on the lock and
knows about trap. A successful DC 10 Dexterity check using
thieves’ tools disables the trap.


14 Chapter Two | Level 1-4 Traps

```
Level 1-4 Moderate
These traps will probably harm characters of this level.
```
```
B C	
Hybrid trap (level 1-4, moderate, hinder)
A small crystal sits on a pedestal; a rune of detection is
inscribed on the crystal.
Trigger (Touch Object). A creature that touches the crystal
triggers the trap.
Effect (Blindness). When triggered, the rune opens a small
hatch under the crystal which releases a beam of light that
hits the crystal, creating a blinding flash. All creatures
within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving
throw or be blinded for 1 minute, or for 2 minutes if the
creature has darkvision.
At the end of each of their turns, a creature blinded in this
way can attempt a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a
success, the creature is no longer blind.
Countermeasures. A creature can spot the rune with a
successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check and detect magic
reveals an aura of abjuration magic on the crystal. Once
discovered, a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check or
dispel magic can disable the rune.
```
```
C C
Hybrid trap (level 1-4, moderate, hinder)
The chamber has many columns around its edge and a
single source of light near its center. This combination casts
dark and solid shadows along the walls. A rune of detection is
inscribed near the light source, and bags of flour or a similar
substance are concealed on the ceiling of the shadowed
areas, ready to drop.
Trigger (Step Into Light/Darkness). A creature that enters an
area in shadow triggers the trap.
Effect (Falling Object). When activated, the rune releases
a bag of flour over the triggering creature, who must make
a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature
is covered in flour for 1 minute. Any attack roll against a
creature doused in flour has advantage if the attacker can
see it, and the affected creature automatically fails Stealth
checks. An affected creature can remove the flour as an
action on their turn.
Countermeasures. A creature can spot the rune with a
successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check; if a creature
makes this check with disadvantage and succeeds, they can
spot the bags of flour. A creature that can reach the rune
can disable it with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana)
check, and a creature that can reach the bags without
entering the shadows can remove them easily. Casting dispel
magic on the rune also disables the trap, and increasing the
light in the room is a way to bypass the trap.
```
```
S S
Mechanical trap (level 1-4, setback, harm)
Two large stones are tied to the ceiling with hempen ropes,
clearly visible to all. A thin tripwire is stretched across the
room, underneath the stones. This trap is often used in
narrow corridors, making the stones harder to avoid.
Trigger (Tripwire). A creature that walks through the
tripwire triggers the trap.
Effect (Swinging Object). The stones tied to the ceiling swing
toward the triggering creature, who must make a DC 10
Dexterity saving throw. A creature has disadvantage on
this saving throw if the trapped area is only 5 feet wide or
smaller. The creature takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage on a
failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
Countermeasures (Sensitive). A successful DC 10 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the tripwire. A successful DC 10
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the tripwire, but
a check with a total of 5 or lower triggers the trap.
```
```
T P, M
Mechanical trap (level 1-4, setback, harm)
A 20-foot deep vertical shaft is hidden under a trapdoor
disguised to look like the rest of the floor. The trapdoor
covers a 5-foot square space and has a pressure plate
embedded in it.
Trigger (Pressure Plate). A creature that steps on the trapdoor
activates the pressure plate, making the trap door swing open.
Effect (Drop Into Empty Pit). The triggering creature must
make a DC 10 dexterity saving throw. On a successful save,
the creature is able to grab onto the edge of the pit. On a
failed save, the creature falls into the pit and takes 7 (2d6)
bludgeoning damage.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the pressure plate and a successful DC 10
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trap.
```

Chapter Two | Level 1-4 Traps 15

```
S G
Mechanical trap (level 1-4, moderate, harm)
2 suits of armor, made of boiled leather and chainmail,
stand in various locations in the area. A creature that
approaches a suit of armor quietly can hear the soft clicking
of clockwork gears emanating from within.
Trigger (Musical/Auditory). Creatures who move or perform
actions within 20 feet of a suit of armor must make a
successful DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check each round to
avoid triggering the trap.
Effect (Animate Object). When triggered, the suits of armor
animate and attack all other creatures in the area. The suits
of armor use the game statistics for animated object, armor
with the following changes:
```
- The armor’s hit points are 18 (4d8).
- The armor’s AC is 15.
- The armor’s Constitution is 12 (+0)
- The armor doesn’t have the Antimagic Susceptibility trait.
- The armor doesn’t have the Multiattack action.
**_Countermeasures (Difficult)._** A successful DC 12 Wisdom
(Perception) check alerts a creature to the clockwork and
gears inside the armor, and a successful DC 12 Intelligence
(Investigation) check lets a creature figure out that the armor
could animate if activated with vibrations from sound.
A creature next to a suit of armor can attempt a DC 12
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, deactivating their
mechanisms on a success. A check that totals 5 or less
triggers the trap. Using a spell like _silence_ to muffle sound can
also work, but spellcasting within 20 feet of the armor will
trigger the trap.

```
R’ B, M
Mechanical trap (level 1-4, moderate)
A poorly disguised tripwire is easily detected, but it is a
facade. The true trap is well hidden and set to go off if the
decoy is tampered with.
Trigger (False Trigger). Disarming, or attempting to disarm,
the false trigger triggers the real trap.
Effect (Random Trap). Randomly select another mechanical
trap of the same or lower lethality and use its effect.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the false and real triggers. A successful DC 12
Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals the nature of the
trap and allows a creature to make a DC 12 Dexterity check
using thieves’ tools to disable the real trigger. On a success,
the real trap is disabled.
```
E F

_Magic trap (level 1-4, moderate, hinder)_

Within the area, etchings on the floor, a lone crystal, or
something is the locus of this magic trap.

**_Trigger (Produce Flame)._** If any non-magical source of light
such as a candle, torch, or oil lamp is created or brought into
the area, the trap triggers.

**_Effect (Spell Effect)._** The trap casts _prestidigitation_ and with a
loud _woosh_ , the triggering flame is extinguished by a strong
and localized magical wind.

**_Countermeasures._** _Detect magic_ reveals an aura of
transmutation magic on the etchings. A creature that
succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check understands
the etchings and knows about the trap.

A spellcaster can disable the trap with a successful DC 12
ability check using their spellcasting ability; casting _dispel
magic_ on the area will also disable the trap

O  P

_Magic trap (level 1-4, moderate, block)_

This chamber’s floor is covered with pictographs, and the
walls are painted to resemble armored warriors standing
behind shields.

**_Trigger (Mortal Sacrifice)._** Any creature killed in this area
triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Suggestion)._** The pictographs on the floor glow with
a soft light, and the trap attempts to implant a suggestion in
the mind of creatures in the chamber. All creatures in the
chamber must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, a creature puts their weapons away and doesn’t
engage in combat for 1 minute. Creatures that can’t be
charmed are immune to this effect.

Casting _dispel magic_ on a creature affected by the trap ends
the effect for that creature.

**_Countermeasures._** A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana,
History, or Religion) check lets a creature identify the
pictographs on the walls, alerting them to the trap. The
pictographs also have an aura of enchantment magic when
viewed with _detect magic_.

The trap can be disabled with _dispel magic_ or by a spellcaster
that succeeds on a DC 12 spellcasting ability check.


16 Chapter Two | Level 1-4 Traps

```
S S
Mechanical trap (level 1-4, moderate, harm)
A pair of double doors engraved with a scene of the night sky
blocks the path. These doors pull open easily, but a tension
cable is attached to them on the side opposite the engraving.
Trigger (Tripwire). A creature that opens the doors triggers
the trap.
Effect (Swinging Object). A spiked ball on a chain swings
down at the triggering creature. They trap attacks the
triggering creature with a +6 attack bonus, dealing 5 (1d10)
bludgeoning damage and 5 (1d10) piercing damage if it hits.
This attack can’t gain advantage or disadvantage.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception)
check lets a creature spot the cable through some gaps
around the hinges, and a successful DC 12 Dexterity check
while using thieves’ tools disables the trap.
```
```
U U
Hybrid trap (level 1-4, moderate, harm)
This corridor is entirely unlit. There are sconces along the
length of the corridor, and a basket of torches at one end. The
basket has enough torches for all of the sconces. In the middle
of the corridor, a rune of detection is inscribed on the wall.
Trigger (Bring Object). A creature that brings a lit torch 30
feet into the corridor triggers the trap.
Effect (Spikes). When activated, the rune engages the
mechanisms below the floor and spikes shoot up along the
corridor. Each creature in the corridor must make a DC 12
Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) piercing damage on a
failed save or half as much on a success.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception)
check lets a creature spot the rune and the holes in the floor
for the spikes, although this check has disadvantage if the
creature has no other source of light and cannot see in
the dark. A creature can disable the rune with a successful
Intelligence (Arcana) check or dispel magic.

S S
, M
Mechanical trap (level 1-4, moderate, harm)
Three spears are hidden within the walls, floor, or ceiling
of this area. A thin, almost invisible tripwire is strung
across the area, under the spears. This trap is usually used
in narrow corridors, doorways, or other passages that are
frequently traversed.
Trigger (Tripwire). A creature that walks through the
tripwire triggers the trap.
Effect (Spears). Spears thrust toward the triggering creature,
who must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. The creature
takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as
much on a successful one.
Countermeasures (Sensitive). A successful DC 12 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the false and real triggers. A
successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals
the nature of the trap and allows a creature to make a DC
12 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to disable the real
trigger. On a success, the real trap is disabled.
```
```
S S
Mechanical trap (level 1-4, moderate, harm)
At the bottom of a steep flight of stairs is a 30-foot deep pit
under a trap door. A pressure plate is disguised as part of
one of the steps, halfway up the stairs.
Trigger (Pressure Plate). A creature that steps on the
pressure plate triggers the trap.
Effect (Drop Into Empty Pit). The trap door at the bottom of
the stairs opens and the stairs themselves flatten into a slide,
sending any creature on the stairs down to the bottom and
into the pit. All creatures on the stairs must make a DC 12
Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save a creature is able
to grab onto the edge of the pit. On a failed save, the creature
falls into the pit and takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage.
The trap door doesn’t close, and climbing out of the pit
doesn’t require a Strength check, but the stairs do not reset.
Travelling up the stair slide requires a DC 12 Dexterity
(Acrobatics) check or a DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check to
climb the walls. A creature that fails either check falls onto
the slide and might fall in the pit again.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the pressure plate. A successful DC 12
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the pressure
plate, and a check with a total of 5 or lower triggers the trap.

Chapter Two | Level 1-4 Traps 17

C  B
Magic trap (level 1-4, dangerous, hinder)
This circle of runes covers a 10-foot radius sphere and emits
a thick, green smoke that smells of sulphur.
Trigger (Command Word). Using a wand, rod, ring, orb,
or similar item that requires a command word activates
the trigger.
Effect (Bewitchment). The triggering creature must succeed
on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be cursed by bad luck.
When a cursed creature enters a new situation or starts a
new encounter, roll a d20 and reference the table below.
This poor luck does not extend to dice rolls, inflict status
effects, confer advantage or disadvantage, or impact combat in
any way. It is intended to impact circumstances, such as extra
guards or a poor first impression with an important NPC.
```
```
d20 Bad Luck
1-2 Catastrophic. The circumstance is as bad as it
could be. Important NPC’s are hostile or the city
watch is on high alert for some reason. A serious,
time-consuming, or difficult impediment crops up.
```
```
3-9 Terrible. The circumstance is much worse than
it might otherwise be. There are a few additional
guards, a moderately difficult complication, or an
unfriendly NPC.
10-19 Unfortunate. The circumstance is slightly worse
than it might otherwise be. There’s only 1 or two
guards, an indifferent NPC, or a complication
that’s easy to overcome.
```
```
20 Lifted. The cloud of bad luck lifts and the crea-
ture is no longer cursed.
At the end of each day, a bewitched creature can make a DC
15 Charisma saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for

_Mechanical trap (level 1-4, dangerous, harm)_

The floor of the empty tunnel is paved with uneven flagstones.

**_Trigger (Weight Sensitive Surface)._** When 20 or more pounds
of weight are placed on the central flagstone, it depresses
and cracks a glass vial filled with liquid.

**_Effect (Poison Gas)._** The liquid quickly becomes a 20-foot-
radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog centered on
the triggering creature. The fog spreads around corners. It
lasts for 10 minutes or until strong wind disperses the fog.
Its area is heavily obscured.

When a creature enters the fog’s area for the first time on a
turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC
15 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 16 (3d10)
poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

**_Countermeasures._** A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the hidden vial, and a successful DC 15
Dexterity check while using thieves’ tools disables the trap.

A sprawling passage of demon script, written in Infernal,
spreads across the pages of a dusty tome. It glows like the
embers of a dying fire.
Trigger (Read Writing). Any creature can read the writing,
even if they don’t speak Infernal. Reading the writing aloud
triggers the trap.
Effect (Summon Creature). When triggered, the trap
summons 2 dretches , or other fiends of CR ¼ or lower. The
dretches attack all other creatures in the room and will not
leave the area. After 1 minute, or if reduced to 0 hit points,
the dretches vanish into a puff of brimstone.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Religion)
check lets a creature understand the danger of the text. The
tome has an aura of conjuration magic when viewed with
detect magic.
A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the tome with
a successful DC 15 spellcasting ability check; dispel magic cast
on the tome also disables the trap.

within the lamp snaps when exposed to the heat, activating
the trap.
Effect (Scything Blades). A curved blade concealed in the wall
slashes at the triggering creature, which must make a DC 15
Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 16 (3d10) slashing
damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
On a failed save, the creature is also restrained as they are
pinned against the opposite wall by the blades.
A creature restrained by the blades can free themselves with
a successful DC 15 Constitution (Athletics) check or another
creature can free them with a successful DC 15Strength

A large, oil-filled ceramic jug hangs from the ceiling by an
old hempen rope, subtly connected to a tripwire stretched
across the room. Its lid has a sparking mechanism that will
set the oil ablaze if the jug falls and breaks.
Trigger (Tripwire). A creature that walks through the
tripwire triggers the trap.
Effect (Falling Object). The jug falls and breaks on the floor,
spreading flaming oil in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered
on the triggering creature. The triggering creature can try
to catch the falling jug with a successful DC 15 Dexterity
(Athletics) check. Otherwise, each creature in the area must
make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire
damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
Countermeasures (Sensitive). A successful DC 15 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the tripwire. A successful DC 15
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trap, but a
check with a total of 10 or lower triggers it.

Magic trap (level 1-4, dangerous, block)
Carved into the wooden statue is a glyph of warding (sleep)
which looks like a wreath of flowers and leaves. Soft,
ambient forest noises fill the air around it.
Trigger (Creature Detector). A creature that approaches
within 5 feet of the glyph triggers the trap.
Effect (Sleep). When triggered, the trap casts sleep , sending
creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is how
many hit points of creatures this spell can affect. Creatures
within 20 feet of a point next to the triggering creature
range are affected in ascending order of their current hit
points (ignoring unconscious creatures).
Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit
points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious
for 1 minute. If a sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an
action to shake or slap them, they wake up.Subtract each
creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the
creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit
points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for
that creature to be affected.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 15 Intelligence
(Investigation) check reveals the trigger, but usually a creature
would need to be within 5 feet of the glyph to make this check.
Detect magic can also reveal the trigger. A creature adjacent to
the glyph can disable it with a successful DC 15 Intelligence
(Arcana) check. Dispel magic also disables the glyph.

of two parts, and can easily be separated to pass through. A
rune of detection is hidden in the design of the tapestry.
Trigger (Pass Area). If a dwarf moves through the tapestry
the trap is triggered.
Effect (Barrier). A creature passing through the tapestry
when the trap is triggered must make a DC 15 Strength
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 16 (3d10)
piercing damage as a falling portcullis crushes them.
Additionally, they are trapped beneath the portcullis and
restrained. Freeing a creature from beneath the portcullis
requires a successful DC 15 Strength check.
On a successful save, the creature dodges the portcullis, and
can choose which side of the barrier to be on.
Countermeasures. A creature can detect the rune with a
successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check or with detect
magic. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check or dispel
magic disables the trap.

Hybrid trap (level 1-4, perilous, harm)
Shadowed archways line the walls of this chamber. The floor
is a crumbling mosaic of a giant skull with flames in its eyes
and a gaping mouth. A rune of detection is hidden in the mosaic
Trigger (Fail to Speak Password). A creature that walks
atop the skull mosaic and doesn’t speak the password
triggers the trap.
Effect (Net). When activated, the rune releases a large rope
from the ceiling. Each creature in a 10-foot radius centered
on the triggering creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity
saving throw or be restrained by the net until freed. The net
is covered with a sticky acid that burns on contact. A creature
that touches the net for the first time on a turn, or who ends
its turn touching the net, takes 14 (4d6) acid damage.
A creature restrained by the net can use its action to make
a DC 17 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature
within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit
points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys
a 5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in
that section.
Countermeasures. A creature can spot the rune with a
successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check or with detect magic.
A creature that succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation)
check can find the password hidden in the mosaic.
Speaking the password, a successful DC 17 Intelligence
(Arcana) check, or dispel magic cast on the rune disables it.

Magic trap (level 1-4, perilous, harm)
Tiny sigils line the walls of this chamber, difficult to notice,
but ready to activate once a creature falls asleep.
Trigger (Unconsciousness). A creature that goes unconscious
within the area triggers the trap.
Effect (Summon Creature). The runes glow with an eerie light
and summons fey spirits that take the form of 4 swarms of
bats that appear in unoccupied spaces within the chamber.
The bats are hostile and attack, targeting unconscious
creatures first. The bats disappear after 5 minutes or if
reduced to 0 hit points, and will not leave the chamber. The
trap could summon other creatures of an appropriate theme
for the environment, as long as they are CR ¼.
Countermeasures. A creature can discover the runes with
a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence
(Arcana) check, or with detect magic. The runes can be
disabled with a successful DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check
or with dispel magic.

floor, or ceiling of this area.
Trigger (Creature Detector). A creature that gets within 10
feet of the rune triggers the trap.
Effect (Elemental Blast). The glyph casts burning hands. Each
creature in a 15-foot cone centered on the triggering creature
must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes
3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
a successful one.
The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t
being worn or carried.
Countermeasures. A creature can discover the glyph with a
successful DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check, but to do
so they would have to be within 10 feet of the glyph. Detect
magic can also reveal the glyph. With a successful DC 17
Intelligence (Arcana) check, a creature adjacent to the glyph
can disable it; dispel magic can also disable the glyph.

The ceiling is lined with large rocks held up by unseen
mechanisms. The way forward is blocked by a door,
portcullis, or other non-magical obstruction which can
be opened by a lever on the wall. However, there are three
levers, and pulling the wrong one sets off the trap.
Trigger (Move Lever/Press Button). Pulling the wrong lever
triggers the trap.
Effect (Falling Objects). All creatures within the chamber
or passageway must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw,
taking 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half
as much on a successful one. The area is difficult terrain
unless the rocks are moved.
Countermeasures (Difficult). A successful DC 17 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the hidden mechanisms that
hold up the rocks, and a creature that succeeds on a DC 17
Intelligence (Investigation) check can deduce the correct
lever from the amount of wear on each. A successful DC 17

Hybrid trap (level 1-4, perilous, block)
A wide stone archway adorns the way out of this room.
Chiselled into the adjacent wall is a short sentence; ‘Only
the small may pass, like sand through an hourglass’. A rune of
detection is inscribed the apex of the archway.
Trigger (Speak Trigger Word). A creature that says the word
‘sand’ in Common or one other language appropriate to the
area triggers the trap.
Effect (Falling Sand). When activated, the rune releases
blocking mechanisms in the room’s ceiling and sand starts to
pour in. A creature in the room must make a successful DC
17 Dexterity saving throw at the beginning of its turn to stay
atop the sand. The save DC increases by 2 each round.
A creature that fails one saving throw is buried up to their
knees and restrained. On their next saving throw, if the
creature succeeds they dig themselves out and are no longer
restrained; if they fail they are buried waist-deep and
remain restrained.
A creature buried waist-deep must make a DC 17 Strength
saving throw at the beginning of their turn; if they succeed
they dig themselves free of the sand and if they fail they are
buried to the neck and immobilized. On their next turn, the
creature is completely buried and starts suffocating.
As an action, a creature can dig out another creature with
a successful Strength (Athletics) check against the current
save DC of the trap. Spells like freedom of movement or
movement modes like burrow can also allow creatures to
freely move through the sand.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 17
Wisdom (Perception) check finds the rune and the hidden
holes in the ceiling. Detect magic can also reveal the rune. If a
creature makes a successful DC 17 Wisdom (Insight) check,
they deduce the trigger word.
A successful DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check or dispel magic
disables the trap.

25-foot diameter circle area in the center of the room. The
ceiling directly above the ring is blackened with soot. In the
5-foot square at the circle’s center is something intriguing.
Trigger (Weight Sensitive Floor). When a Small or larger
creature steps onto a space adjacent to the 5-foot square
at the center of the area within the ring, they activate a
pressure plate. Parts of the stonework slide away, revealing
spouts which pour flaming oil onto the floor from the ring’s
inner edge.
Effect (Wall of Fire). The flaming oil creates a ringed wall of
flames 25 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The
wall is opaque and lasts for 1 minute. When the wall appears,
each creature within its area must make a DC 20 Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 17 (5d6) fire
damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
The side of the wall facing inwards deals the trap’s fire
damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of
that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage
when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its
turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.
A creature that is adjacent to the wall can make a DC 20
Constitution check using thieves’ tools to end this effect.

metal spikes. In the centre of the room is a stone monolith,
into which a glowing, blue _glyph of warding (thunderwave)_ has
been carved.

**_Trigger (Creature Detector)._** Creatures that come within 10
feet of the monolith trigger the trap.

**_Effect (Elemental Blast)._** The glyph casts _thunderwave_. Each
creature in a 15-foot cube centered on the triggering creature
must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, a creature takes 9 (2d8) thunder damage and is pushed 10
feet away from the triggering creature. On a successful save,
the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.

A creature that is pushed hits the spikes on the walls of the
room, suffering another 9 (2d8) piercing damage.

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the
area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from the
triggering creature, and the spell emits a thunderous boom
audible out to 300 feet.

**_Countermeasures._** A successful DC 20 Intelligence
(Investigation) check or casting _detect magic_ reveals the glyph.
A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check, or _dispel
magic_ cast on the glyph disables it. However, in most cases a
creature would need to be within 10 feet of the monolith to
detect or disable the glyph with an ability check.

Effect (Drop Into Lower Area). When the trap activates,
the passage tips, forming a ramp. All creatures in the
passageway must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a
successful save a creature is able to jump to safety or cling to
the floor as it tips downward. On a failed save, the creature
falls into a lower area of the dungeon or structure and takes
17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals a gap along the edges of the passageway floor,
and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools
locks the hinge in place. A DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation)
check reveals a well-hidden lever to deactivate the trap.

Mechanical trap (level 1-4, deadly, harm)
Nailed to the walls of this subterranean tunnel are dozens of
pointed ears. The trap designer enchanted the area with an
alarm spell, set to alert a creature that lairs nearby.
Trigger (Creature Detector). A good elf that enters the
tunnel triggers the trap.
Effect (Release Creatures). The sound of a hand bell fills
the tunnel for 10 seconds, audible out to 60 feet. The sound
wakes up a creature. Roll on the table below to determine
what creature is roused.

Mechanical trap (level 1-4, deadly, harm)
At the end of the corridor is a locked iron door, covered with
rust. Next to it is a polished metal button.
Trigger (Press Button). A creature that presses the button
triggers the trap.
Effect (Crushing Ceiling/Walls). The walls of this corridor
start to move slowly inwards, at a rate of 1 foot per round
at the end of the initiative order. Once the surface reaches
a creature’s space, they take 1d10 bludgeoning damage. If
the surface is still moving on the next turn, the creature is
restrained and takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage. A third
round spent being crushed inflicts 4d10 bludgeoning
damage, the fourth and every round thereafter inflicts 10d10
bludgeoning damage until the surface retracts. The walls
retract after covering 5 feet.
Countermeasures (Difficult). A successful DC 20 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals something about the button. A
successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals
the nature of the trigger, and allows a creature to attempt a
DC 20 Dexterity check while using thieves’ tools to disable it.

```
o, we were finally out of that godsforsaken jungle
and into the somewhat cooler interior of the temple.
After clearing aside some cobwebs and most certainly
disturbing more insects than I care to think about, we
sallied forth into the bowels of the temple, ready to get our
hands on this artifact we’ve been hearing so much about.
We head along down a corridor and, in retrospect, I feel like
I should have known something was up. Long abandoned
temple, tripwires-of-barbarian-murdering hidden in the
trees, and here we were with a nice, long, open corridor?
Not bloody likely...
I looked around and saw dust motes floating in the air,
shimmering in the sunlight coming through the temple
entry. It was almost kind of pretty. Then I noticed more dust.
Falling dust. From the ceiling. As soon as I opened my mouth
to say something, we all felt this deep rumbling coming from
around us. Yes, it was pretty clear that things were about to
get bad, and quickly.
The left wall started inching toward us and I could sense tiny (or,
in some cases, not-so-tiny) bouts of claustrophobia blossoming
in all of us. To make matters worse, foot-long spikes erupted
from the mouths of the sculptures on the wall to our right. If
we didn’t do something fast, we were going to be pulped or
```
```
skewered; a fate I would perhaps wish on my worst enemies
but almost certainly not upon myself or my companions.
As the walls got close, our barbarian (gods bless the brute)
stretched out his arms and braced against them. Every
vein in his face stood out as he strained, his feet wide, his
shoulders and back bunching and flexing as the pressure
built. A horrendous grinding sound came from a mechanism
within the walls as it fought the big man’s incredible
strength. He started screaming as his bones began cracking,
muscle tearing. Our cleric started healing him, mending his
body even as it was breaking...
And then there was a sound, like a clank, a clatter, or
something falling apart, and the wall stopped. We were alive
for the moment, but something told me this isn’t the worst
this place can do...
The traps in this chapter are designed to challenge
characters who are levels 5-8 and are grouped by their
lethality. Any of these traps can be dropped right into a
dungeon or similar adventure and shouldn’t require any
preparation. For more information on customizing traps, go
to Chapter 8: Designing Traps , or for a completely random
and unexpected trap, go to Chapter 9: Random Trap

Hybrid trap (level 5-8, setback, subdue)
A rickety rope bridge is the only way to span a chasm,
beneath which is a swirling portal.
Trigger (Weight Sensitive Surface). If a creature of size
Medium or larger moves across the bridge, they must succeed
on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or the bridge breaks.
Effect (Drop Into Portal). Any creatures on the bridge when
it breaks fall into the chasm unless they succeed on a DC
10 Dexterity saving throw. At the bottom of the chasm is
a portal that teleports creatures into a large holding cell,
deeper into the surrounding area. A successful DC 10
Intelligence (Arcana) check, or detect magic , reveals the nature
of the portal, but not where it goes.
Countermeasures (Difficult). A creature that succeeds on a
DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the flimsy nature of
the bridge. A successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation)
check reveals that the bridge won’t bear much weight, and
allows a creature to attempt a DC 10 Dexterity check while
using thieves’ tools or carpenter’s tools to disable the trap.

Hybrid trap (level 5-8, setback, harm)
This chamber has dozens of dart holes along it’s walls, but
no pressure plates, tripwires, or mechanical triggers of any
kind. A rune of detection near the floor of the chamber lights
up when creatures of a certain type reach the middle of the
area, filling the room with poisoned darts.
Trigger (Creature Detector). When a creature of the chosen
type reaches the middle of the trapped room the trap activates.
Effect (Darts). The trap fires two darts at each creature in the
room. Each ranged attack has a +5 attack bonus and deals 1
piercing damage and 3 (1d6) poison damage.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 10
Wisdom (Perception) check can find small darts scattered
around the outside of the room, as well as the rune near the
floor. The rune can also be found with detect magic.
With a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check, a creature
can disrupt the rune; dispel magic also disables the trap.

Level 5-8 Setback

These traps should present a minor inconvenience to
characters of this level range.

B B

_Mechanical trap (level 5-8, setback, block)_

A sturdy hand crank is affixed to a wall next to a closed
portcullis. Turning the crank raises the portcullis, but also
makes hidden portcullises drop down and block other exits
from the area.

**_Trigger (Turn Wheel/Crank)._** Raising the portcullis more
than 1 foot triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Barrier)._** All other exits to the chamber are blocked
by a portcullis which drops into their threshold and locks in
place. A portcullis can be unlocked with a successful DC 10
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools and then raised with a
successful DC 10 Strength check.

**_Countermeasures (Difficult, Sensitive)._** The hidden
portcullises and the mechanism on the crank can be spotted
with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, and
successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a
character to understand the mechanism enough to disable it. A
successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables
the trap, and a check with a total of 5 or lower triggers the trap.

B B

_Magic trap (level 5-8, setback, harm)_

A cresset filled with crackling flames stands in a place of
pride at the centre of the chamber. It has been forged to
resemble a diabolical face with its mouth open as if in a
hideous scream of pain.

**_Trigger (Draw Weapon)._** Unsheathing a metal weapon
or carrying a drawn metal weapon into the trapped area
triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Heat Metal)._** The trap makes the drawn or unsheathed
weapon glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with
the object takes 8 (2d8) fire damage from the trap.

If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes
the damage from it, the creature must succeed on a DC 11
Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it
doesn’t drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls
and ability checks until it does so.

This effect lasts until dispelled or for 1 minute.

**_Countermeasures._** An aura of transmutation magic
surrounds the cresset when viewed with _detect magic_ , and
a creature that succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)
check finds some melted remnants of weapons scattered
around the area. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence
(Arcana) check, a creature knows the melted pieces were
affected by a spell of some kind.

A spellcaster that succeeds on a DC 10 spellcasting ability check
can channel a little bit of magic into the cresset and disable it.
Casting _dispel magic_ on the cresset also disables the trap.

```
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 10
Wisdom (Perception) check can spot the rune and the hidden
nozzle for the flame jet, 5 feet below it. The rune can also be
found with detect magic.
A creature adjacent to the rune can disable it with a DC 10
Intelligence (Arcana) check, although in most cases getting
that close would set off the trap. Dispel magic can also disable
the rune.

Hybrid trap (level 5-8, setback, subdue)
Resting atop a stone plinth covered by an embroidered velvet
cloth is an immaculate blade. The silvered sword shines with
radiance, illuminating a poem engraved upon the blade. A
rune of detection is worked into the embroidery on the cloth.
Trigger (Read Writing). Reading the script on the blade
aloud triggers the trap.
Effect (Drop Into Empty Pit). When activated, the rune
opens a trapdoor that creates a pitfall around the plinth. Any
creature within 5 feet of the plinth must succeed on a DC 10
Dexterity saving throw or fall into a 20-foot deep pit.
A creature that falls into the pit takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning
damage and is restrained by the thick grease at the bottom
of the pit. A creature restrained by the grease can free
themselves with a successful DC 10 Strength check.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 10
Wisdom (Perception) or Intelligence (Arcana) check can
spot the rune, and it can also be found with detect magic. A
successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check or casting dispel
magic on the rune disables it.

Mechanical trap (level 5-8, setback, hinder)
When a creature steps on a pressure plate, a hidden hatch in
the ceiling springs open and several gallons of an extremely
sticky slime drop down.
Trigger (sensitive, Pressure Plate). The hatch is 15 feet square,
and the pressure plate is a 5-foot square in the middle of that
area. Stepping on the pressure plate activates the trap.
Effect (Falling Object). The slimed area is difficult terrain
and any creature that enters or starts its turn in the area
must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be
restrained. As an action, a creature restrained by the slime
can make a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check; if it succeeds it
is no longer restrained.
Countermeasures (Sensitive). A successful DC 10 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the pressure plate and ceiling
hatch and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves’
tools disables the trap. A check with a total of 5 or lower
triggers the trap.

Mechanical trap (level 5-8, setback, harm
This bare chamber is featureless except for the large, ornate
fireplace against the far wall. The mantle and hearth are
made of marble sculpted into the form of a twisting dragon.
A dim light emits from the back of the fireplace, but it is
otherwise cold.
Trigger (Pressure Plate). The fireplace is large enough for
one Medium creature to investigate, but if they do they step
on a pressure plate and trigger the trap.
Effect (Barrier). The triggering creature must succeed on
a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be trapped as metal
bars shoot up from the floor behind them, sealing them
in the fireplace. The cage bars can be pushed down with a
successful DC 10 Strength check.
Countermeasures. The pressure plate can be spotted with a
successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, and a successful
DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trap.

O & C
Mechanical trap (level 5-8, setback, block)
The circular steel door leading out of a tunnel has a metal
wheel attached to it, which can open the door but also
triggers the trap.
Trigger (Turn Wheel/Crank). Turning the wheel triggers the
trap and locks the door.
Effect (Barrier). A portion of the tunnel ceiling 20 feet back
from the door opens, and boulders and debris rain down on
a 10-foot square area. Any creatures in the area of the rubble
must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6)
bludgeoning damage on a failure, or half as much on a success.
Clearing the rubble or smashing open the door requires
a successful DC 10 Strength check. The door can also be
unlocked with a DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.
Countermeasures. The mechanism on the crank can be
spotted with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check,
and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools
disables the trap.

Hybrid trap (level 5-8, setback, harm)
A rune of detection glyph is written on the wall, floor, or
ceiling. When a creature gets too close, the rune activates a
hidden jet of flame.
Trigger (Creature Detector). A creature that gets within 20
feet of the rune triggers the trap.
Effect (Elemental Blast). When activated, the rune releases a
jet of flame from the hidden nozzle. The trap makes a ranged
attack against the triggering creature and up to two other
targets within 20 feet. These attacks have a +5 bonus and
deal 7 (2d6) fire damage each, and these attacks can’t gain
advantage or disadvantage.

Magic trap (level 5-8, moderate, harm)
A glyph of warding (flaming sphere) is inscribed on the floor of
this room. If an open flame is created within or brought
into the chamber, it instantly leaps off its torch, escapes
from its lantern, or hops out of the campfire and becomes
a flaming sphere.
Trigger (Produce Light/Darkness). If a creature creates or
brings an open flame into the chamber, the trap is triggered.
Effect (Spell Effect). When activated, the glyph casts
flaming sphere ; a 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in
an unoccupied space next to the triggering creature. Any
creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must
make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 7
(2d6) fire damage from the sphere on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.
Each round, on initiative count 10, the sphere moves up to
30 feet, always trying to stay next to the triggering creature.
If the sphere runs into a creature, that creature must make
the saving throw against the sphere’s damage, and the
sphere stops moving this turn.
The sphere can jump over barriers up to 5 feet tall and across
pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects
not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-
foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
The sphere lasts until dispelled, or for 1 minute.
Countermeasures. A creature can find the glyph with a
successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check or with
detect magic. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check,
or dispel magic , disables the glyph.

_Mechanical trap (level 5-8, setback, subdue)_

A 30-foot deep vertical shaft is hidden under a trapdoor,
disguised to look like the rest of the floor. The trapdoor
covers a 5-foot square space and has a pressure plate
embedded in it.

**_Trigger (Pressure Plate)_**. A creature that steps on the
trapdoor activates the pressure plate, causing the trap door
to swing open.

**_Effect (Drop Into Empty Pit)_**. The triggering creature must
make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a success, the creature
is able to grab onto the edge of the pit. On a failure, the creature
falls into the pit and takes 11 (3d6) bludgeoning damage.

**_Countermeasures._** A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the pressure plate and a successful DC 10
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trap.

Level 5-8 Moderate

These traps will probably harm characters of this level.

_Mechanical trap (level 5-8, moderate, harm)_

This well-adorned and locked chest contains something
of value. A glass vessel containing a noxious concoction is
hidden in the lid and breaks open if the chest is unlocked by
any means other than with its key.

**_Trigger (Wrong Key)_**_._ Using the wrong key (such as a skeleton
key), or successfully picking the lock triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Poison Gas)_**_._ When triggered, the glass vessel within
the lid breaks open and creates a 20-foot-radius sphere of
poisonous, yellow-green fog centered on the chest. The fog
spreads around corners. It lasts for 1 minute or until strong
wind disperses the fog, Its area is heavily obscured.

When a creature enters the fog’s area for the first time on a
turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC
12 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 14 (4d6)
poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.

**_Countermeasures._** A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception)
or Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals the mechanism
in the lid that will release the vial. A successful DC 12
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trap.

The faint smell of death and decay comes from this chamber.
The corpse of a slain adventurer, monster, or animal is lying
on the floor. A putrid slime, giving off a wretched smell,
coats the corpse.
Trigger (Interact With Bait). A creature that touches or
searches the dead creature inadvertently gets the slime on
their hands and clothing.
Effect (Acid/Slime Blast). The slime is especially difficult
to remove, and the smell gets worse and worse as the
creature moves around. Creatures stained with the slime
have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks for 1 hour.
The slime can be removed with 10 minutes of thorough
scrubbing with soap and water.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 13 Wisdom (Perception)

the false trigger sets off the real trap.
Effect (Random). Randomly select a mechanical trap of the
same or lower lethality and use its effect.
Countermeasures (Difficult). A successful DC 12 Wisdom

Trigger (Pass Area). A creature that moves past the center of
the room triggers the trap.
Effect (Barrier). A 1-inch wide stone slab drops down across
the center of the room with a massive thud, splitting it in
two. A creature that succeeds on a DC 12 Dexterity check can
slip under the slab as it descends.
Countermeasures. If a creature succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom

An alcove large enough for a single Medium creature is
empty, except for a chain dangling in the middle. Etched
into the back of the alcove is a door frame. Pulling the chain
doesn’t open the door; it drops a barrel of acidic slime onto
the triggering creature.
Trigger (Pull Rope/Chain). Pulling on the rope triggers
the trap.
Effect (Falling Objects). The barrel falls onto the triggering
creature and splashes it with slime. The creature must
make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5 (1d10)
bludgeoning damage plus 16 (3d10) acid damage on a
failed save, or half as much acid damage on a successful one,
and no bludgeoning damage.

in the area or bring a drawn weapon into the area sets off
the trap.
Effect (Spell Effect). When activated, the glyph casts shatter.
Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the
triggering creature must make a DC 12 Constitution saving
throw. A creature takes 13 (3d8) thunder damage on a failed
save, or half as much on a successful one. A creature holding
an item in their hand must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving
throw or drop what they are holding as they cover their ears.

A beautifully painted urn depicting monks in silent worship
sits in a depression. The urn rests on a plinth that glows
with a soft radiance. Lifting the urn reveals a small glyph of
warding (silence).
Trigger (Cast Spell). A creature that casts a spell within 20
feet of the urn triggers the trap.
Effect (Spell Effect). When activated, the glyph casts silence.
For 10 minutes or until dispelled, no sound can be created

frightened this way must take the Dash action and move
away from the tube by the safest available route on each of
its turns, unless there is nowhere to move.

If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t
have line of sight to the tube, the creature can make a
Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, this effect ends
for that creature.

This effect ends for all creatures if dispelled with _dispel magic_
or after 1 minute.

**_Countermeasures (Difficult)._** The glass tube has an aura
of illusion magic when viewed with _detect magic_. A creature
that succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check
finds some scattered notes in the workshop that explain the
nature of the trap.

A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the tube with
a successful DC 10 spellcasting ability check; _dispel magic_ cast
on the tube also disables the trap.

_Mechanical trap (level 5-8, moderate, harm)_

A large fountain takes up most of this room. The fountain is
10 feet wide, 20 feet long, and 2 feet deep. Coins and gems
litter the bottom of the fountain, but disturbing the water
releases 4 ice mephits.

**_Trigger (Disturb Liquid)._** Disturbing the water triggers
the trap.

**_Effect (Release Creatures)._** The ice mephits have made this
fountain their home. When the water is disturbed they
attack, trying to drive off intruders.

**_Countermeasures._** Due to their False Appearance trait, the
mephits are almost impossible to spot under the water; they
appear as crystal clear shards of ice. However, they could
be detected with _detect evil and good_ or with features like the
paladin’s Divine Sense.

Mechanical trap (level 5-8, dangerous, harm)
The lower deck of the pirate ship is poorly lit and filled with
hammocks; a large chest is secured here, obscured by tarps.
Trigger (Tension Cable). A thin wire connects the chest lid to
the ceiling. If the lid is lifted the wire goes slack, triggering
the trap.
Effect (Falling Objects). Conical wooden spikes (called fids)
fall from the ceiling. The triggering creature must make a DC
15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) piercing damage
on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save.
Countermeasures (Sensitive). A successful DC 15 Wisdom

Magic trap (level 5-8, dangerous, harm)
Horrifying wailing sounds burst forth from a tome resting
on a plinth made of ice. Swirling ink covers the pages of the
tome, throbbing in sync with the screams.
Trigger (Open/Close Object). Closing the tome stops the
screams, but triggers the trap.
Effect (Elemental Blast). A blast of cold erupts from the
tome, freezing it in a block of ice. All creatures in a 15-foot
cone centered on the triggering creature must make a DC
15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) cold damage on a
failure or half as much on a success. The tome can be broken
free of the ice with a DC 15 Strength check.
Countermeasures (Difficult). The tome has an aura of
evocation magic when viewed with detect magic , and a creature
that succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check can spot
fragments of shattered ice around the base of the plinth.
Examining the tome and succeeding on a DC 15 Intelligence
(Arcana) check lets a creature understand how the trap works.
A spellcaster can make a DC 15 spellcasting ability check to
try and disrupt the magic around the tome, and dispel magic
cast on it will disable the trap as well.

jarred in place. Creatures could easily get beneath it.
Trigger (Remove Barrier). Removing a portcullis, usually by
lifting it up, triggers the trap.
Effect (Barrier). Lifting a portcullis makes the previous one
close, forcing creatures to proceed forward.
Countermeasures (Difficult). A successful DC 15 Wisdom

Effect (Falling Object). When pulled off it’s ledge, a 10-gallon
ceramic vessel crashes and spreads alchemist’s fire and oil
in a 15-foot radius centered on the triggering creature. All
creatures in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 28 (8d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as

Countermeasures (Difficult). A creature that succeeds on a DC
15 Wisdom (Perception) check notices something odd about the
rope, and with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation)
check they can spot that the rope is tied to a ceramic jar at the
top of the shaft, instead of a firm anchor point. A creature can

warding (dispel magic)_ is hidden in the lintel of the door frame.

**_Trigger (Fail to Speak Password)._** A creature that passes
through the opening without speaking the password
“solidify” triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Dispel Magic)._** When activated, the glyph casts _dispel
magic_ , targeting the triggering creature. Any spell of 3rd level
or lower active on the creature ends.

**_Countermeasures._** A successful DC 15 Intelligence
(Investigation) check or casting _detect magic_ reveals the
glyph. The shards of crystal and glass spell out the password
in Primordial.

Hybrid trap (level 5-8, deadly, harm)
A locked door has 6 colored crystals embedded around the
edges and a rune of detection inscribed on the front. To unlock
the door, the crystals must be arranged in the correct order
in a pattern of holes in the center of the door.
Trigger (Wrong Combination). Arranging the crystals in the
incorrect order triggers the trap.
Effect (Falling Sand). Small chutes open in the room’s ceiling
and disgorge sand that quickly fills the room. Creatures
in the area must make a successful DC 17 Dexterity saving
throw at the beginning of their turns to stay atop the sand.
The save DC increases by 2 at the end of each round.
A creature that fails one saving throw is buried up to their
knees and restrained. On their next saving throw, if the
creature succeeds they dig themselves out and are no longer
restrained; if they fail they are buried waist-deep and
remain restrained.
A creature buried waist-deep must make a DC 17 Strength
saving throw at the beginning of their turn; if they succeed
they dig themselves free of the sand and if they fail they are
buried to the neck and immobilized. On their next turn, the
creature is completely buried and starts suffocating.
As an action, a creature can dig out another creature with
a successful Strength (Athletics) check against the current
save DC of the trap. Spells like freedom of movement or
movement modes like burrow can also allow creatures to
freely move through the sand.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the hidden chutes for the sand. A creature
that succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check
understands that only the correct combination of crystals
in the door’s center will open the door. Clues for the correct
combination might be present in the room or elsewhere in
the surrounding area.
The rune of detection is plainly visible, and also revealed with
detect magic. A creature can disable the rune with a successful
DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check, which disables the trap.

Magic trap (level 5-8, dangerous, harm)
The stench of blood dripping from an altar fills the air. The
scarlet liquid seems to ooze from the stone by some magical
means, flowing into cracks in the floor in a constant cycle.
On either side of the altar are bronze statues of humanoids
with open mouths, baring long fangs.
Trigger (Corpse). Bringing a corpse within 20 feet of the
altar triggers the trap.
Effect (Reanimate Creatures). The corpse that triggered the
trap is animated as a ghast that attacks any creatures in the
altar room. The ghast will not go farther than 40 feet from
the altar. It crumbles to dust if reduced to 0 hit points or
after 24 hours.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC
15 Intelligence (Religion) check knows about the altar
and understands the trap. The trap also has an aura of
necromancy magic when viewed with detect magic.
A spellcaster that succeeds on a DC 15 spellcasting ability

A 1-foot thick ring of decorative stonework surrounds a
25-foot diameter circular area in the center of the room. The
ceiling directly above the ring is blackened with soot. In the
5-foot square at the circle’s center is something intriguing.
Trigger (Weight Sensitive Floor). When a Small or larger
creature steps onto a space adjacent to the 5-foot square at the
center of the area within the ring, they activate a pressure plate.
Parts of the stonework slide away, revealing spouts which pour
flaming oil onto the floor from the ring’s inner edge.
Effect (Wall of Fire). The flaming oil creates a ringed wall of
flames 25 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The
wall is opaque and lasts for 1 minute. When the wall appears,
each creature within its area must make a DC 17 Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 28 (8d6) fire
damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
The side of the wall facing inwards deals the trap’s fire
damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of
that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage
when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its
turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.
A creature that is adjacent to the wall can make a DC 17
Constitution check using thieves’ tools to end this effect.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the pressure plate, and a successful DC 17
Dexterity check while using thieves’ tools disables it.

The floor of this dark cavern is uneven, and something
crunches sickeningly beneath your feet as you enter.
Trigger (Produce Light/Darkness). Bringing or producing
light, non-magical or magical, into the cavern triggers the trap.
Effect (Reanimate Creatures). Light reveals the bones in this
room and they begin to glow with a sickly hue, animating
into 8 skeletons that attack all creatures in the cavern. The
skeletons will not leave the cavern, and they stay active until

Wooden floorboards cover the floor of the corridor ahead,

Trigger (Weight Sensitive Surface). When a Medium or
larger creature steps on the central floorboard, the bottles of
poison hidden beneath burst and emit a noxious gas.
Effect (Poison Gas). The trap creates a 20-foot radius sphere
of poisonous gas. It lasts for 10 minutes or until strong
wind disperses the fog. Its area is heavily obscured. When a
creature enters the fog for the first time on a turn or starts
its turn there, that creature must make a DC 17 Constitution
saving throw. The creature takes 28 (8d6) poison damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A glyph of warding (phantasmal killer) is worked into the
reversed symbol.
Trigger (Pass Area). A creature that passes over the runic
symbol on the floor triggers the trap.
Effect (Spell Effect). When activated, the glyph casts phantasmal
killer , targeting the triggering creature. The spell taps into
the nightmares of the creature and creates an illusory
manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature.
The target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, the target becomes frightened for the duration.
At the end of each of the target’s turns before the spell ends,
the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw
or take 22 (4d10) psychic damage. On a successful save, the
spell ends. The spell also ends if dispelled or after 1 minute.
Countermeasures. If a creature investigates the dust around
the room and succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana)
check, they can discern the residue of materials used to
make the glyph and they know about the trap. This doesn’t
reveal the location of the glyph, but the creature knows it’s
in the room somewhere.
A creature can find the glyph with a successful DC 17

armor made of red metal, a flask of silvery liquid, an open
book filled with symbols and glyphs, a twisting obsidian
candlestick, and dozens of other oddities. Standing out from
them all is a prism filled with swirling purple smoke.
Trigger (Detect Magic). A creature that casts detect magic
within the chamber triggers the trap.
Effect (Petrification). When triggered, the prism shatters
and the smoke within surges towards the triggering creature
and down their airways. The creature must make a DC 20
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is
restrained as their flesh begins to harden and change into
ivory. On a successful save, the creature isn’t affected.
A creature restrained in this way must make a DC 20
Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If
it successfully saves against this effect three times, the effect
ends for that creature. If it fails its save three times, it is turned
into a statue of ivory and petrified. The successes and failures
don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the
creature collects three of a kind.
The creature remains petrified until the effect is dispelled,
either with dispel magic or greater restoration , or after 1 hour. If
a creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from
similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.
Countermeasures (Difficult). A creature that succeeds on a

stone in odd shapes scattered around the area, remnants
of petrified creatures. With a successful DC 20 Intelligence

_Magic trap (level 5-8, perilous, harm)_

This charred-black chamber is notably hotter than the rest,
and a single stone in one wall glows bright with orange veins
of a lava-like substance. A _glyph of warding (burning hands)_ is
inscribed on the glowing stone.

**_Trigger (Creature Detector)_**_._ A creature that gets within 5
feet of the stone triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Elemental Blast)_**_._ When activated, the glyph casts
_burning hands_ as a 5th level spell. Each creature in a 15-foot
cone centered on the triggering creature must make a DC 17
Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 24 (7d6) fire damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t
being worn or carried.

**_Countermeasures._** A creature can spot the rune without
activating it with a successful DC 17 Intelligence
(Investigation) check; _detect magic_ can also reveal the glyph.

With a successful DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check a creature
can disable the rune, but to do so they would need to be next to
the glyph, activating it. _Dispel magic_ can also disable the glyph.

Level 5-8 Deadly

_Mechanical trap (level 5-8, deadly, harm)_

The exit to the chamber or corridor is blocked by a locked
door, portcullis, or other removable barrier. On the wall next
to the exit are six small levers inset in the wall. They are all
in the down position.

**_Trigger (Move Lever/Press Button)_**. Moving any of the levers
except one to the up position triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Crushing Ceiling/Walls)_**_._ Any other exits to the
chamber or corridor are suddenly blocked by a door,
portcullis, or other barrier. A grinding noise fills the area
the ceiling begins to drop down. The ceiling moves at a rate
of 1 foot per round at the end of the initiative order. Once
the surface reaches a creature’s space, they take 5 (1d10)
bludgeoning damage. If the surface is still moving on the
next turn, the creature is restrained and takes 10 (2d10)
bludgeoning damage. A third round spent being crushed
inflicts 20 (4d10) bludgeoning damage, the fourth and every
round thereafter inflicts 50 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and
then the surface retracts.

**_Countermeasures (Difficult)._** A successful DC 20 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the gap between the walls and the
ceiling. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check
reveals that one of the levers is far more worn than the rest,
indicating that it’s the correct lever while the rest are decoys.
The locked exit can also be opened with a successful DC 20
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.

F B
Magic trap (level 5-8, deadly, harm)
A glyph of warding (conjure elemental) is inscribed on the ceiling
of this room. If any kind of open flame - candles, torches, or
lanterns - are brought into or ignited in this room, the glyph
summons an air elemental.
Trigger (Produce Flame). If any open flame is brought into
or ignited in the room, the trap is triggered.
Effect (Summon Creature). When activated, the glyph casts
conjure elemental. An air elemental appears in an unoccupied
space within 10 feet of the open flame that triggered the
trap. The elemental disappears when it drops to 0 hit points
or after 1 hour. The elemental also disappears if targeted
with dispel magic (DC 15, 5th-level spell).
The elemental is hostile to all creatures in the room and
attacks indiscriminately, but it will not leave the room.
Countermeasures. A creature that can see in the dark can find
the glyph on the ceiling with a successful DC 20 Intelligence
(Investigation) check; detect magic can also reveal the glyph.
Once found, a creature can disable the glyph with a successful
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check or with dispel magic.

Magic trap (level 5-8, deadly, hinder)
Polished to perfection, the enormous black opal in the centre
of this chamber shows a shadowed version of reality in its
reflection. Resting on a small plinth, the spherical jewel is at
least six feet across and exudes a chilling aura.
Trigger (Look Into). A creature adjacent to the opal can look
into it to investigate distorted reflection. Unfortunately,
gazing into the opal triggers the trap.
Effect (Invisibility). The creature must succeed on a DC
20 Constitution saving throw or become invisible for 10
minutes, or until this effect is dispelled ( dispel magic DC 15).
Anything the creature is wearing or carrying is invisible as
long as it is on their person. A creature rendered invisible by
the jewel can be seen in the shadowy version of reality inside
it, but is otherwise invisible.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 20
Intelligence (Arcana or History) check recognizes the jewel
and understands the danger of the trap. The jewel has an
aura of illusion magic when viewed with detect magic.
A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the jewel with
a successful DC 20 spellcasting ability check; casting dispel
magic (DC 15) on the jewel also disables the trap.

Magic trap (level 5-8, deadly, harm)
A strange book with an intricate blue leather cover rests in
this room, surrounded by chunks of ice. A glyph of warding (ice
storm) is inscribed inside the book.
Trigger (Creature Detector). The trap is triggered if any non-
good creature opens the book.
Effect (Spell Effect). When activated, the glyph casts ice storm
as a 5th-level spell. A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the
ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered
on the triggering creature. Each creature in the cylinder
must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 13 (3d8)
bludgeoning damage and 14 (4d6) cold damage on a failed save,
or half as much damage on a successful one.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 20
Intelligence (History) check remembers details about this
book and understands the trap. The book also has an aura
of abjuration magic when viewed with detect magic , and the
glyph can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence
(Investigation) check.
Once found, the glyph can be disabled with dispel magic or
with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

Mechanical trap (level 5-8, deadly, block)
This chamber is lit by lava which flows in gutters around
the top of the walls. The floor is made of hexagonal blocks
of obsidian, as are the room’s long, central table and the
surrounding chairs. The table is covered with roasted meats,
ash-covered molten cheeses, and crusty loaves of bread.
Trigger (Weight Sensitive Surface). The six armless chairs
are each a single piece of obsidian, including the floor piece.
When a Small size or larger creature sits in a chair, the
floor below them erupts in a jet of flame. Each chair can be
triggered separately, and disabling one chair doesn’t disable
the others.
Effect (Elemental Blast). The triggering creature must make
a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. They take 55 (10d10) fire
damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the mechanism connected to each chair, and a
successful DC 20 Dexterity check while using thieves’ tools
disables the trap for that chair.

Magic trap (level 5-8, deadly, harm)
In the center of this room’s floor is a broad, low-rimmed
stone bowl, with a glyph of warding (conjure elemental) inscribed
within. A drip of flammable liquid from the ceiling lands
in the bowl periodically. If an open flame is brought into or
ignited in the area, the flame of the torch or lamp suddenly
becomes animated, leaps down to the floor, runs to the bowl
and jumps into it, igniting an incredible blaze. From the
inferno emerges a fire elemental.
Trigger (Produce Flame). Bringing an open flame or igniting
one in the room triggers the trap.
Effect (Summon Creature). When activated, the glyph casts
conjure elemental. A fire elemental appears in an unoccupied
space within 10 feet of the bowl and is hostile to all creatures
in the room. The elemental disappears after 1 hour, or when
it drops to 0 hit points or if dispelled with dispel magic (DC 15,
5th-level spell).
Countermeasures. A creature that can see in the dark can find
the glyph in the bowl with a successful DC 20 Intelligence
(Investigation) check; detect magic can also reveal the glyph.
Once found, a creature can disable the glyph with a successful
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check or with dispel magic.

Magic trap (level 5-8, deadly, block)
A small black opal rests alone on the smooth flagstone floor
in the middle of a long corridor. A glyph of warding (black
tentacles) is inscribed on the underside of the opal.
Trigger (Creature Detector). When a creature gets within 5
feet of the opal the trap activates.
Effect (Spell Effect). The glyph casts black tentacles ; squirming,
ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on the ground, centered on
the triggering creature. For 1 minute or until dispelled, these
tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.
When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on
a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on
a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning
damage and be restrained by the tentacles until the spell
ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already
restrained by the tentacles takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 20 Intelligence
(Investigation) check can find the glyph, but a creature close
enough to examine the opal sets off the trap. Detect magic also
reveals the glyph.
A successful dispel magic disables the glyph; a successful DC
20 Intelligence (Arcana) check can also disable the glyph but
a creature would need to be close enough to set off the trap
to tamper with the glyph in this way.

_Mechanical trap (level 5-8, deadly, harm)_

Hundreds of bottles hang from the ceiling on thin pieces
of wire, each filled with a strange, ooze-like creature. The
miniature oozes slop against their glass prisons as you walk
past, as if sensing your presence. By the chamber door is a
shelf of bottles filled with different fluids, and a complex
device resembling a set of scales. The scales are weighed down
completely on one side with one of the fluid-filled bottles.

**_Trigger (Wrong Combination)._** Weighing down the other
side of the scale completely triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Falling Objects)._** The ooze-filled bottles fall from the
ceiling. Avoiding a falling bottle requires a successful DC
20 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures who fail to avoid the
vessels are covered with mini-oozes. The first time the oozes
cover a creature, and at the start of each of their turns when
covered with ooze, the creature takes 17 (5d6) acid damage.
A creature can scrape an ooze off themselves or another
creature as an action.

**_Countermeasures._** A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the trigger and a successful DC 20 Dexterity
check using thieves’ tools disables it.

R G

_Magic trap (level 5-8, deadly, harm)_

The statue of a deity sits atop a well-adorned pedestal with
a _glyph of warding (spirit guardians)_ inscribed on it. The glyph is
keyed to creatures of a particular type or alignment.

**_Trigger (Creature Detector)_**_._ A creature of the chosen type
approaching within 5 feet of the statue triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Spell Effect)_**_._ When activated, the glyph casts _spirit
guardians_ as a 5th level spell. A sudden swirl of tiny angelic
(good deity), fey (neutral deity), or fiendish (evil deity)
spirits materialize around the triggering creature. The glyph
doesn’t specify any creatures to be unaffected by this spell.

The guardians affect an area in a 15-foot radius around the
triggering creature. In that area, other creatures’ speed is
halved and when a creature enters the area for the first time
on a turn or starts its turn there, they must make a DC 20
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes
22 (5d8) radiant damage (if the deity is good or neutral) or
22 (5d8) necrotic damage (if the deity is evil). On a successful
save, the creature takes half as much damage.

The guardians last for 10 minutes or until dispelled with
_dispel magic_ (DC 15, 5th-level spell).

**_Countermeasures._** A creature that succeeds on a DC 20
Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes the statue and
understands the trap. The glyph can be found with a DC 20
Intelligence (Investigation) check or with _detect magic_.

Once found, the glyph can be disabled with _dispel magic_ or
with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check).


40 Chapter Four | Level 9-12 Traps

## LEVEL 9-12 TRAPS

# I

```
am a self-aware rogue. I can admit my faults. I know
what I am. I say this because, and I know this may
surprise some of you, I have a weakness for gold and
expensive looking things. With that out of the way...
We got through that godawful corridor, ultimately
unscathed thanks to the combined efforts of the cleric and
the barbarian. After this harrowing moment, we, of course,
chose to continue onward, perhaps because we may not be
the best at taking architecturally-based hints that none-
too-subtly say “STAY OUT!”
We came to this lovely courtyard surrounded by walls and
overgrown greenery. In the center of this courtyard was a
pedestal, and on this pedestal sat a wonderfully expensive-
looking golden idol of a happy little monkey. I know what
you’re thinking, and yes, I am not so lacking in humility to
admit that I wanted it. Badly.
Something in my head started encouraging me to take
the idol. Taking expensive-looking things tends to be my
modus operandi anyway, so of course, I strode boldly forth
and snatched the little golden rascal. Easy as taking candy
from someone incapable of stopping a thief from taking
their candy.
```
```
Then, before I knew it, as I was staring lovingly at my new
favorite thing, I couldn’t feel my hand. A blackness started
creeping from my fingertips, over my hand, and up my arm!
Everyone saw. I started screaming. Then the barbarian started
screaming and decides he can solve the problem in his usual
way: with his axe! Thankfully, before he turned me into an
idol-less amputee, our wizard (bless her) got in his way.
Out of what I can only guess was a sense of self-preservation
that overcame my sense of self-enrichment, I dropped the
idol back onto the pedestal. Our cleric made it over to me and
used some of that wonderful divine magic to get my arm back
to its old familiar self again.
I’ll never understand the people who build these places, using
perfectly good valuables as mere bait for good rogues like
myself just trying to get by. What’s the world coming to...
The traps in this chapter are designed to challenge characters
who are levels 5-8 and are grouped by their lethality. Any
of these traps can be dropped right into a dungeon or
similar adventure and shouldn’t require any preparation.

```
B K	
Mechanical trap (level 9-12, setback, harm)
The corridor slopes down towards a single, battered door.
The door looks as if it has been battered by something big,
but it remains locked. The keyhole is complex, with lots of
tiny spurs inside.
Trigger (Use Wrong Key). Picking the lock or using any key
but the correct one activates a separate mechanism inside
the door.
Effect (Rolling Boulder). The ceiling above the higher end
of the corridor opens, releasing a massive circular boulder
that rolls toward the bottom of the corridor. All creatures
present roll initiative as the sphere is released. The sphere
rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet
in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures’
spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it
as difficult terrain.
Whenever the sphere enters a creature’s space or a creature
enters its space while it’s rolling, that creature must succeed on
a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning
damage and be knocked prone. The sphere stops when it hits a
wall or similar barrier. It can’t go around corners.
As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can
attempt to slow it down with a DC 10 Strength check. On a
successful check, the sphere’s speed is reduced by 15 feet.
If the sphere’s speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no
longer a threat.
Countermeasures. A creature can spot the hidden
mechanism with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)
check, and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves’
tools disables the trap.
```
```
B G
Magic trap (level 9-12, setback, hinder)
An ornately detailed scroll case is mounted into a heavy
stone base carved to resemble a humanoid hand.
Trigger (Tension Cable). Lifting the scroll case puts tension
on the cable attached to it, triggering the trap.
Effect (Blindness). Magical darkness fills a 15-foot-radius
sphere around the scroll case. The darkness spreads around
corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this
darkness, and non-magical light can’t illuminate it.
The darkness emanates from the scroll case and moves with it.
Completely covering the case with an opaque object, such as a
bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness. If any of this effect’s area
overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd level or
lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled.
The darkness lasts for 10 minutes or until dispelled with
dispel magic.
```
```
Level 9-12 Setback
These traps should present a minor inconvenience to
characters of this level range.
```
```
A A
Magic trap (level 9-12, setback, hinder)
A small statuette of an animal is enchanted to transform a
creature that picks it up, to prevent thievery. This sort of trap
may be used by someone who has a use for such animals, or
perhaps just has a strange sense of humor.
Trigger (Pick Up Object). A creature that picks up the
statuette triggers the trap.
Effect (Transmutation). The triggering creature makes a
DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails, they are
transformed into the same beast as the statue for 10 minutes,
or until they drop to 0 hit points or die. This effect doesn’t
work on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.
A transformed creature’s game statistics, including mental
ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the beast it
transforms into. It retains its alignment and personality.
The creature assumes the hit points of its new form. When
it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the
number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it
reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess
damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess
damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit
points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.
A transformed creature is limited in the actions it can
perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast
spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.
The creature’s gear melds into the new form. It can’t activate,
use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
At the end of each of its turns, a creature transformed
by this effect can make another Wisdom saving throw.
On a success, this effect ends. This effect also ends for all
creatures if dispelled, either with dispel magic or remove curse.
Countermeasures (Difficult). With a successful DC 10
Wisdom (Perception) check, creatures can find evidence of the
animal around the room: things like fur, horns, broken pieces
of tack, and the like. Once found, a creature that succeeds on
a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check realizes these are from
polymorphed creatures and is aware of the trap.
The statuette has an aura of transmutation magic when
viewed with detect magic. With a successful DC 10 spellcasting
ability check, a spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment
on the statue, disabling the trap. Casting dispel magic on the
statuette also disables the trap.

E C
Mechanical trap (level 9-12, setback, harm)
Rune-covered monoliths mark the edges of this clearing. In
the center of the clearing is a large spherical stone that sits
in the opening of a vertical tunnel shaft, blocking it from
being opened. 4 dust mephits are trapped in the shaft.
Trigger (Pick Up/Shift Object). Moving the sphere away from
the opening it covers triggers the trap.
There is no ability check to disable this trap because nothing
is preventing the stone from being moved.
Effect (Release Creatures). The dust mephits trapped held
in the vertical tunnel beneath the stone are released into
the area and attack all other creatures. If dropped to half of
their hit points or fewer, the mephits flee.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 10
Wisdom (Perception) check hears the sounds of the mephits
scrabbling and chattering in the tunnel. With a successful
DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check, a creature recognizes the
sounds and can identify the mephits.

G B
Mechanical trap (level 9-12, setback, harm)
Often used to alert the trap setter of incoming danger, the
gas bomb is triggered by a tripwire along the floor connected
to the cork of a bottle containing a clever alchemical
concoction. As soon as the cork is pulled the bottle explodes
in a cloud of gas; the sound of the bottle opening is audible
at quite a distance.
Trigger (Tripwire). A creature that walks through the trip
wire activates the trap.
Effect (Poison Gas). A 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous,
yellow-green fog erupts from a point next to the triggering
creature. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for 10
minutes or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the
spell. Its area is heavily obscured.
When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on
a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC
10 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 10 (3d6)
poison damage from the trap on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.
The fog moves 10 feet away from its starting point at the
start of each round, rolling along the surface of the ground.
The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of
the land, even pouring down openings.
Countermeasures (Sensitive). A successful DC 10 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the trip wire. A successful DC 10
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trip wire,
and a check with a total of 5 or lower triggers the trap.
```
**_Countermeasures._** A creature that succeeds on a DC 10
Wisdom (Perception) check spots the tension cable, and a
successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables it.

The scroll case has an aura of evocation magic when viewed
with _detect magic_ , and a creature that succeeds on a DC 10
Intelligence (Arcana) check understands the effect of this trap
but not the trigger. With a successful DC 10 spellcasting ability
check, a spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the scroll
case, disabling the trap. _Dispel magic_ also disables the trap.

D B

_Mechanical trap (level 9-12, setback, block)_

The long corridor ahead is covered by green, shimmering
demon mouths carved from stone. They appear every 10 feet
down the 60-foot long corridor in vertical lines on the walls. At
each line of demon mouths, a pressure plate is set into the floor.

**_Trigger (Pressure Plate)._** A Small or larger creature stepping
on a pressure plate triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Barrier)._** Iron bars shoot from each line of demon
mouths, forming a 6 grates across the corridor. A creature
in the 5-foot wide area in front of the demon mouths must
make a DC 10 Dexterity check. On a success, the creature can
choose which side of the barrier they end up on; otherwise,
the creature lands on a random side of the barrier.

**_Countermeasures (Sensitive)._** A successful DC 10 Wisdom
(Perception) check lets a creature spot a pressure plate, and
each one can be disabled with a successful DC 10 Dexterity
check using thieves’ tools. However, a check that totals 5 or
less sets off the trap.

Magic trap (level 9-12, setback, hinder)
A beautiful noise echoes throughout this gemstone-encrusted
cavern. It sounds something like a mixture of whalesong,
lyre music, and a heavenly choir. A glyph of warding (sleep) is
inscribed in this cavern, hidden among the gems.
Trigger (Speak Trigger Word). A creature saying the word
‘sound’, in either Common or a language appropriate for the
area, triggers the trap.
Effect (Sleep). When activated, the glyph casts sleep as a 2nd-
level spell, sending creatures into a magical slumber. Roll
7d8; the total is how many hit points of creatures the glyph
can affect. Creatures within 20 feet of a point next to the
triggering creature are affected in ascending order of their
current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).
Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit
points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious
for 1 minute, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses
an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each
creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the
creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit
points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for
that creature to be affected.
Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren’t
affected by this spell. The spell can also be dispelled with
dispel magic.
Countermeasures. With a successful DC 10 Wisdom
(Perception) check, a creature can spot remnants of a journal
in the cavern. After reading the journal, a creature can make
a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check; if they succeed, they deduce
the trigger word.
The glyph can be found with a successful DC 10 Intelligence
(Investigation) check or with detect magic. The glyph can be
disabled with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check
or with dispel magic.

Mechanical trap (level 9-12, setback, subdue)
This 50-foot deep vertical shaft is hidden under a trapdoor
which has been disguised to look like the rest of the floor.
The trapdoor is 5-foot square and has a pressure plate
embedded in it.
Trigger (Pressure Plate). A creature that steps on the
trapdoor activates the pressure plate, causing the trap door

Hybrid trap (level 9-12, setback, harm)
The alcove ahead is shrouded in darkness and a soft tinkling
can be heard from within it, perhaps the sound of coins or
gemstones falling into a pile. It’s distinctly different from the
sounds heard throughout the rest of the area. In the alcove, a
rune of detection waits to activate a powerful jet of water.
Trigger (Step Into Light/Darkness). A creature moving into
the shadowed alcove triggers the trap.
Effect (Elemental Blast). When activated, the rune triggers
a hidden mechanism that emits a blast of water. The blast
attacks the triggering creature with a +5 ranged attack bonus
and deals 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage if it hits. A creature
hit by the blast is knocked prone.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 10
Wisdom (Perception) check spots the signs of massive water
damage outside the shadowed area. A creature that can see
in the dark can find the rune with the same check; detect
magic also reveals the rune.
Once found, the rune can be disabled with a successful DC
10 Intelligence (Arcana) check or with dispel magic. Using
light sources to remove the darkness can also bypass the
triggering conditions for the trap.

Mechanical trap (level 9-12, moderate, harm)
This chamber has a strangely bouncy floor and is
uncomfortably warm. Mounted on the walls are dozens
of busts of infernal creatures with sneering smiles and
leering eyes.
Trigger (Musical/Auditory). Making a sound in the chamber
causes the floor to vibrate and give way. Creatures who move
or perform actions in the trapped area must make a successful
DC 12 Dexterity (Stealth) check each round to avoid triggering
the trap.

falls into the 20-foot deep pit and takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning
damage. Green flames lick through a grate at the bottom of
the pit. A creature that enters the flames for the first time, or
starts its turns in the flames, takes 7 (2d6) fire damage.
Countermeasures (Difficult). A successful DC 12 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals sensitive nature of the floor, and
allows a creature to make a DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation)
check; if they succeed they understand how the trap works.

_Magic trap (level 9-12, moderate, harm)_

Hanging from the ceiling above is an ornate brass longbow,
covered with strange gears and pistons. Beneath the bow is a
copper bowl filled with small cogs, springs, screws, and bolts.
The items in the bowl cover up a _glyph of warding (acid arrow)_.

**_Trigger (Offering)._** If a creature enters this room and then
leaves without placing a small piece of metal into the bowl,
the trap activates.

**_Effect (Elemental Blast)._** When activated, the glyph casts _acid
arrow_ as a 3rd-level spell, targeting the triggering creature.
A shimmering green arrow streaks towards the target and
bursts in a spray of acid. The glyph makes a ranged spell
attack against the target with a +6 bonus. On a hit, the target
takes 5d4 acid damage immediately and 3d4 acid damage at
the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the
target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and
no damage at the end of its next turn.

**_Countermeasures._** A creature that succeeds on a DC 12
Intelligence (History or Religion) check recognizes the bow
and understands the trap.

A creature can find the glyph with a successful DC 12
Intelligence (Investigation) check or with _detect magic_. Once
found, the glyph can be disabled with a successful DC 12

The walls of this antechamber are covered with obsidian
spikes the length of a human finger. On the floor is a dull
_rune of detection_.

**_Trigger (Spill Blood)._** A creature that spills blood in the
antechamber triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Impaling Spikes)._** When activated, the rune engages
hidden mechanisms that power impaling spikes. The spikes
move at a rate of 1 foot per round, always at the end of the
initiative order. They start at one end of the chamber and
keep moving until the spikes touch the opposite surface, at
which point they retract. When the spikes enter a creature’s
space, it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. If the
creature fails they take 21 (6d6) piercing damage, or half as
much on a success. A creature that fails the saving throw is
impaled on the spikes and restrained.

A creature impaled by spikes can free themselves with a

Mechanical trap (level 9-12, moderate, harm)
Atop a stone pedestal sits a shallow copper bowl filled with
a clear liquid. A vial of grayish, green liquid is held over the
copper bowl, balanced on a thin copper stand. When enough
weight is applied to the floor in front of the pedestal, the vial
is knocked off of its perch and it drops into the clear liquid.
A grayish green mist forms immediately.
Trigger (Weight Sensitive Surface). A creature of Medium size
or larger standing in front of the pedestal triggers the trap.
Effect (Poison Gas). A 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous,
grayish-green mist erupts from a point next to the triggering
creature. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for 10 minutes
or until strong wind disperses it. Its area is heavily obscured.
When a creature enters the fog’s area for the first time on a
turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC 12
Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 21 (6d6) poison
damage from the trap on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.
The fog moves 10 feet away from its starting point at the
start of each round, rolling along the surface of the ground.
The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of
the land, even pouring down openings.
Countermeasures (Sensitive). With a successful DC
12 Wisdom (Perception) check, a creature can spot the
sensitivity of the floor. A successful DC 16 Dexterity check
using thieves’ tools disables the trap, but a check with a total
of 5 or less triggers the trap.

Effect (Dart). A barrage of 6 darts shoot from the creature’s
tail toward the triggering creature. The creature must make
a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (3d4) piercing
damage and 7 (3d4) poison damage on a failed save, or half
as much of both on a successful one.
Countermeasures (Difficult). The button is easy to spot,
but with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check a
creature can find some darts scattered around the base of
the statue. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation)
check reveals the hidden mechanisms in the statue, and
allows a creature to attempt a DC 12 Dexterity check while

B B
Magic trap (level 9-12, dangerous, hinder)
A seemingly valuable item is inscribed with a glyph of warding
(confusion) , so as to thwart potential thieves. This is suited to
areas with environmental hazards such as falls or spikes.
Trigger (Touch Object). A creature that touches the object
triggers the trap.
Effect (Spell Effect). When activated, the glyph casts
confusion , assaulting and twisting creatures’ minds,
spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action.
Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the
triggering creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving
throw or be affected by the spell.
An affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10
at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for
that turn.
```
```
d10 Behavior
```
```
1 The creature uses all its movement to move in a
random direction. To determine the direction,
roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face.
tThe creature doesn’t take an action this turn.
2-6 The creature doesn’t move or take actions this turn.
```
```
7-8 The creature uses its action to make a melee
attack against a randomly determined creature
within its reach. If there is no creature within its
reach, the creature does nothing this turn.
9-10 The creature can act and move normally.
At the end of each of its turns, an affected creature can make
a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends
for that target. This effect also ends if dispelled with dispel
magic (DC 14, 4th-level spell), or after 1 minute.
Countermeasures. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence
(History) check, a creature can discern that the item isn’t
really valuable at, but a cheap copy. A creature can find
the glyph on the item with a successful DC 15 Intelligence
(Investigation) check; this doesn’t trigger the trap. Using
detect magic also reveals the glyph.
Once found, the glyph can be dispelled with dispel magic or
with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

glyph activates.

**_Effect (Spell Effect)_**_._ When activated, the glyph casts _spirit
guardians_. A sudden swirl fiendish spirits materialize around
the triggering creature. The glyph doesn’t specify any
creatures to be unaffected by this spell.

The guardians affect an area in a 15 foot radius around the
triggering creature. In that area, other creatures’ speed is
halved and when a creature enters the area for the first
time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a DC 12
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes
13 (3d8) necrotic damage. On a successful save, the creature
takes half as much damage.

**_Countermeasures._** A creature that succeeds on a DC 12

against creatures in the area; each spear has a +6 ranged
attack bonus and deals 3 (1d6) piercing damage on a hit. If hit
by a spear, a creature is restrained by it. Creatures restrained
by spears can make DC 12 Constitution (Athletics) checks to
free themselves, taking 1 piercing damage if they fail. Other
creatures can free those restrained by the spears with a DC
12 Strength (Medicine) check, again dealing 1 damage to the
restrained creature if they fail.

Long metal poles, restrained under pressure within the
ceiling and walls, eject down vertically or at 45 degree angles
in an area up to 40 feet long with the pressure plate being at
the center. Any creatures in the affected area must make a

including the corridors outside the room. A glyph of warding
(blight) is inscribed on the room’s floor.
Trigger (Creature Detector). When a living creature enters
the area, the trap activates.
Effect (Spell Effect). When activated, the glyph casts blight ;
necromantic energy washes over the triggering creature,
draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make
a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. The target takes 36 (8d8)
necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or
constructs. If the triggering creature is a plant creature, it
makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell
deals maximum damage to it.
Countermeasures. The withered remains of a past victim
of this trap are easily found at the entrance to the room; a
creature that investigates and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence
(Arcana) check recognizes the effects of the blight spell.
The glyph can be found with detect magic , or with a successful
DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Once found, the
glyph can be dispelled with dispel magic , or with a successful

_Magic trap (level 9-12, dangerous, harm)_

The room or corridor contains weapon racks and various
equipment; 8 of the weapons have been enchanted to
animate and attack intruders. What constitutes an intruder
is up to the trap’s designer.

**_Trigger (Creature Detector)_**_._ An unauthorized creature
(physical characteristics, race, or alignment) that enters the
area activates the trap.

**_Effect (Animate Objects)_**_._ The enchanted weapons are **8
flying swords**. They attack unauthorized creatures in the
area and ignore all other creatures; they will not leave the
area. They crumble to dust if reduced to 0 hit points or
dispelled. After 1 minute, the weapons return to their resting
places and the trap resets.

**_Countermeasures._** A creature that succeeds at a DC 15
Wisdom (Perception) check spots arcane symbols on the
enchanted weapons, and a creature that succeeds on a DC 15
Intelligence (Arcana) check understands that the weapons
will animate. The enchanted weapons have an aura of
transmutation magic.

5 Seizure The creature is overcome with
shaking. The creature has
disadvantage on Dexterity checks,
Dexterity saving throws, and attack
rolls that use Dexterity.

The creature begins to bleed
uncontrollably. The creature has
disadvantage on Constitution checks
and Constitution saving throws. In
addition, whenever the creature takes
damage, it is stunned until the end of
its next turn
At the end of each of the infected creature’s turns, it must
make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. After failing three of
these saving throws, the disease’s effects last for 7 days, and the
creature stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of
these saving throws, the creature recovers from the disease.

Mechanical trap (level 9-12, perilous, harm)
Strange pictures are painted on the walls of this wooden
temple with thick, gritty paint. They appear to show a forest
coming to life and crushing humans beneath their root-
like feet. A sodden mound of twigs and leaves occupies one
corner  a shambling mound in disguise.
Trigger (Draw Weapon). If a weapon is unsheathed
within the temple or if a weapon is drawn in the area, the
shambling mound rises and attacks.
Effect (Release Creatures). The shambling mound is
dedicated to preserving peace in the temple and only attacks
the triggering creature. If that creature sheathes their
weapon, the shambling mound returns to the corner and
settles down.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 17
Intelligence (Nature) check recognizes the mound as a plant
creature, and a creature that succeeds on a DC 17 Wisdom
(Insight) check understands that the paintings are probably
an admonition against violence in the vicinity.

Magic trap (level 9-12, perilous, block)
Faded and moth-eaten paintings line this portrait gallery.
The only painting that has retained its lustre is that of a
stern-looking woman clothed in furs and wearing a crown of
steel barbs. A glyph of warding (wall of force) is concealed in the
painting’s frame.
Trigger (Pass Area). A creature passing in front of the
painting triggers the trap.
Effect (Spell Effect). When activated, the glyph casts wall
of force. An invisible wall of force springs into existence
extending from the painting to the far wall as a horizontal
barrier. The wall is 1/4 inch thick and lasts for 10 minutes. If
the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the
creature is pushed to a random side of the wall.
Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune
to all damage and can’t be dispelled by dispel magic. A
disintegrate spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The
wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal
travel through the wall.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 17
Intelligence (History) check recognizes the painting and
understands the trap. With a successful DC 17 Intelligence
(Investigation) check, or with detect magic , a creature can find
the glyph without triggering the trap.
Once found, the glyph can be disabled with dispel magic or a
successful DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

_Magic trap (level 9-12, perilous, harm)_

A crystal hovers in the center of this room, shedding light
in a 30-foot sphere. If a non-good creature enters the light,
they are seared by a burning rebuke.

**_Trigger (Creature Detector)_**_._ A non-good creature that
approaches within 30 feet of the crystal triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Elemental Blast)_**_._ The crystal fires a beam of searing
light at triggering creatures. It makes a ranged attack with a
+10 bonus, dealing 66 (12d10) radiant damage if it hits.

**_Countermeasures._** A creature that succeeds on a DC 17
Intelligence (History or Religion) check recognizes the
crystal and understands the trap. _Detect magic_ reveals an aura
of evocation magic around the crystal.

A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the crystal
with a successful DC 17 spellcasting ability check; _dispel magic_
(DC 15) also disables the trap.

_Mechanical trap (level 9-12, perilous, block)_

The exit from this chamber is blocked by a metal cube, 4 feet
on a side. The sides of the cube look like panels that could be
opened, though they seem to be bolted shut. Each side has a
circular groove on it.

**_Trigger (Weight Sensitive Surface)._** Pressing against the cube
to move it triggers the trap; it can be triggered up to
six times (once for each side of the cube). Triggering a
side from a distance allows a character to push the cube
without being trapped.

**_Effect (Cage)._** The triggering creature must succeed on a
DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained by a metal
hemisphere that closes around the creature from the cube.
A creature outside the metal hemisphere can retract it with
a successful DC 17 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, or a
creature can burst out with a successful DC 17 Strength check.

**_Countermeasures._** A successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the mechanisms hidden in the cube, and a
successful DC 17 Dexterity check while using thieves’ tools
disables them.

Mechanical trap (level 9-12, perilous, harm)
The lock of the door is covered with silver filigree and
tiny crystals.
Trigger (Attempt to Pick Lock). A creature that attempts to
pick the lock triggers the trap.
Effect (Needle). A sharp needle pierces the target, dealing
no damage but delivering a poison. The target must make
a successful DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 66
(12d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much on a
successful one.
Countermeasures (Difficult). A creature examining the lock
can discover the needle with a successful DC 17 Wisdom
(Perception) check and understands how it works with a
successful DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check.
Once found and understood, a creature can disable the trap
with a successful DC 17 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.
This also unlocks the door.

Magic trap (level 9-12, perilous, hinder)
A book or tablet lies open in this room, pages dense with
text. Somewhere in the text are the words “Stay here, do not
move or speak”, written in Common or a local language.
Trigger (Read Text). A creature that reads the phrase out
loud triggers the trap.
Effect (Suggestion). The triggering creature must make a DC
17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature stays
where it is and doesn’t move or speak for 8 hours. Creatures
that can’t be charmed are immune to this effect.
The creature has an aura of enchantment magic when
viewed with detect magic. Casting dispel magic (DC 15), or
remove curse on the creature ends the effect.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 20
Intelligence (Arcana) check can spot some hidden sigils and
symbols worked into the other parts of the text, alerting
them to the enchanted nature of the writing. When viewed
with detect magic , the text has an aura of enchantment magic.
A spellcaster that succeeds on a DC 17 spellcasting ability
check can disrupt the enchantment on the text, or the
enchantment can be dispelled with dispel magic (DC 15).

Hybrid trap (level 9-12, perilous, harm)
Half of this space is shrouded in non-magical darkness.
A lantern hangs from a pole on a sturdy chain near the
entrance; a rune of detection is inscribed on the lantern,
hidden in the decorations.
Trigger (Activate Light Fixture). Lighting the lantern
triggers the trap.
Effect (Bolts). When activated, the rune triggers a hail of
crossbow bolts from weapons hidden in the shadowed
side of the room. All creatures within 15 feet of the lantern
must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 42 (12d6)
piercing damage on a failure, or half as much on a success.
Countermeasures. A creature can find the rune with a
successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check or with detect
magic. Once found, a creature can disable the rune with dispel
magic or with a successful DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

Hybrid trap (level 9-12, perilous, harm)
A miniature model of a room is on display in this chamber.
The diorama seems eerily similar to the room it is inside; a
rune of detection is hidden in the designs of the model.
Trigger (Interact with Bait). Moving parts of the replica
room trigger the trap.
Effect (Crushing Ceiling/Walls). The walls of the room begin
to close in, moving until the meet in the middle. The walls
move at a rate of 1 foot per round at the end of the initiative
order. Once the surface reaches a creature’s space, they take
1d10 bludgeoning damage. If the surface is still moving
on the next turn, the creature is restrained and takes 2d10
bludgeoning damage. A third round spent being crushed
inflicts 4d10 bludgeoning damage. The walls retract after
three rounds.
Countermeasures (Difficult). A creature that succeeds
on a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check can find the rune
in the model and with a successful DC 17 Intelligence
(Investigation) check, a creature can deduce the nature of the
trap. Detect magic can also reveal the rune.
Once found and understood, the rune can be dispelled with
dispel magic or disabled with a successful DC 17 Intelligence
(Arcana) check.

Magic trap (level 9-12, deadly, hinder)
A statue, made from iron and spider silk, stands in the rear
of the room; it depicts a repulsive human-spider hybrid.
Around the room are cradles made of spiderweb and rotting
canvas. Flickering candles illuminate reliefs of bowing
figures on the walls of this room.
Trigger (Insult Idol). Creatures that don’t prostrate
themselves before the statue trigger the trap.
Effect (Aging). A creature that triggers the trap must make
a DC 20 Constitution saving throw; on a failure, a wave of
black energy washes over the creature and reduces its age by
16 (3d10) years. Creatures cannot be reduced below 1 year old
in this way. This aging can be reversed with greater restoration
or more powerful magic, such as wish.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 20
Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes the statue and
understands the trap. When viewed with detect magic , the
statue has an aura of necromancy magic.
A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the statue with
a successful DC 20 spellcasting ability check; the trap can
also be disabled with dispel magic (DC 16).

Mechanical trap (level 9-12, deadly, harm)
A 1-foot thick ring of decorative stonework surrounds a
25-foot diameter circle area in the center of the room. The
ceiling directly above the ring is blackened with soot. In the
5-foot square at the circle’s center is something intriguing.
Trigger (Weight Sensitive Floor). When a Small or larger
creature steps onto a space adjacent to the 5-foot square at the
center of the area within the ring, they activate a pressure plate.
Parts of the stonework slide away, revealing spouts which pour
flaming oil onto the floor from the ring’s inner edge.
Effect (Wall of Fire). The flaming oil creates a ringed wall of
flames 25 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The
wall is opaque and lasts for 1 minute. When the wall appears,
each creature within its area must make a DC 17 Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 52 (8d6) fire
damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
The side of the wall facing inwards deals the trap’s fire
damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of
that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage
when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its
turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.
A creature that is adjacent to the wall can make a DC 17
Constitution check using thieves’ tools to end this effect.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the pressure plate, and a successful DC 17
Dexterity check while using thieves’ tools disables it.

_Hybrid trap (level 9-12, perilous, block)_

Walking deeper into the area, a large hallway with an arched
ceiling slopes upward; a _rune of detection_ is inscribed in the
ceiling. If a creature exits the dungeon through this same
hallway with a particular item in their possession, a gigantic
boulder crashes through the ceiling at the upper end,
barreling toward the exit, smashing all in its path. Once it
reaches the bottom of the hallway, that exit is now blocked.

**_Trigger (Pass Area)_**_._ A creature carrying a particular item
across the hallway’s upper entrance threshold triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Rolling Boulder)_**_._ When the trap is activated, the rune
releases a massive boulder; all creatures present roll initiative
as the sphere is released. The sphere rolls initiative with a
+8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The
sphere can move through creatures’ spaces, and creatures can
move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain.

Whenever the sphere enters a creature’s space or a creature
enters its space while it’s rolling, that creature must succeed
on a Dexterity saving throw or take 21 (6d6) bludgeoning
damage and be knocked prone. The sphere stops when it hits
a wall or similar barrier. It can’t go around corners.

As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt
to slow it down with a DC 17 Strength check. On a successful
check, the sphere’s speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere’s
speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.

**_Countermeasures._** A creature that succeeds on a DC 17
Wisdom (Perception) check can spot the rune; _detect magic_ also
reveals the rune.

If a creature can get up to it, they can disable the rune with a
successful DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check. _Dispel magic_ can
also disable the rune.

If a creature can get up to it, they can disable the rune with a
successful DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check. _Dispel magic_ can
also disable the rune.

Magic trap (level 9-12, deadly, block)
Polished blades, enamelled suits of armor, and decorated
shields fill the racks that line the walls of this armory. A glyph
of warding (blade barrier) is inscribed on the chamber’s floor.
Trigger (Creature Detector). A good creature that approaches
within 15 feet of the glyph triggers the trap.
Effect (Spell Effect). When activated, the glyph casts blade
barrier , creating a wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made
of magical energy. The glyph creates a ringed wall 60 feet
in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, centered on the
triggering creature. The wall provides three-quarters cover to
creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain. The wall
lasts for 10 minutes or until dispelled with dispel magic (DC 16).
When a creature enters the wall’s area for the first time on a
turn or starts its turn there, the creature must make a DC 20
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes
33 (6d10) slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature
takes half as much damage.
Countermeasures. With a successful DC 20 Intelligence
(Arcana) check, a creature can sense a lingering trace of
magic on the armor and weapons around the room.
The glyph can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence
(Investigation) check or with detect magic. Once found, it can
be disabled with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana)
check, or with dispel magic.

Hybrid trap (level 9-12, deadly, harm)
The corridor is empty save for a pair of statues that depict
many-legged, serpent-like creatures with tooth-filled maws:
behirs. A thin tripwire stretches between the statues.
Trigger (Tripwire). A creature that walks between the behir
statues snaps the tripwire, triggering the trap.
Effect (Spell Effect). A bolt of lightning arcs from the statues
towards the triggering creature. Three bolts then leap from
that creature to as many as three other random creatures,
each of which must be within 30 feet of the first creature. A
creature can be targeted by only one of the bolts.
A creature targeted by a bolt must make a DC 20 Dexterity
saving throw. The creature takes 45 (10d8) lightning damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Countermeasures. A creature can spot the tripwire with a
successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, and the trap
can be disabled with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check
using thieves’ tools.
When viewed with detect magic , the statues have an aura of
evocation magic. Casting dispel magic (DC 16) on the statues
disables the trap. The status can also be destroyed (AC 17, 20
hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage), which
disables the trap as well.

B B
Simple trap (level 9-12, deadly, block)
A stone slab etched with an enormous skull and crossbones
blocks the way forward. 20 vials of alchemist’s fire are
hidden in niches in the upper parts of the area blocked by
the slab, waiting to fall when the slab is moved.
Trigger (Remove Barrier). The barricade can be removed
easily, but doing so triggers the trap.
Effect (Falling Objects). The vials drop down, smash and then
ignite. Any creature adjacent to the slab must succeed on a
DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be doused in alchemist’s
fire, taking 25 (10d4) fire damage at the start of each of its
turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to
make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.
Countermeasures (Difficult). A creature that succeeds on a
DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check can spot the hidden vials,
and with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check
they can understand how the trap works.
Once understood, the trap can be disabled with a successful
DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. Finding a way
to remove the barricade without being next to it also helps
creatures avoid this trap.

Mechanical trap (level 9-12, deadly, harm)
Something corrosive is splattered around the base of an
unlocked door. It seems to have eaten into the floor. A hidden
mechanism is built into the door, ready to drop creatures
into a hidden pit.
Trigger (Open/Close Door). Opening the door triggers
the trap.
Effect (Drop Into Acid). The triggering creature must make
a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the
creature is able to grab onto the edge of the pit. On a failed
save, the creature falls into the 50-foot deep pit and takes 17
(5d6) bludgeoning damage. The pit is filled with three feet
of corrosive acid. A creature that enters the acid for the first
time or starts its turn in it takes 16 (3d10) acid damage.
Any non-magical weapon or armor that is made of metal
that a character is wearing or holding that touches the
acid begins to corrode. At the start of each turn in the pit,
the following occurs: A weapon takes a permanent and
cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to
-5, the weapon is destroyed. Non-magical ammunition made
of metal that touches the acid is destroyed after dealing
damage. Armor or shields take a permanent and cumulative
-1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10
or a shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed.
Countermeasures (Difficult). A creature that succeeds on
a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check spots the trapdoor in
front of the door, and with a successful DC 20 Intelligence
(Investigation) check they can understand the trap.
Once understood, the trap can be disabled with a successful
DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.

floor of this chamber, most with soot stains and scorch marks.
A wraith lies in wait, awakening at the slightest disturbance.
Trigger (Musical/Auditory). A creature that makes too much
noise triggers the trap.
Effect (Release Creatures). When roused, the wraith rises
up from the piles of bones and attacks, focusing first on the
triggering creature. The wraith will not leave the area.
Countermeasures. Creatures that move through the area or
take actions in it must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity (Stealth)
check, otherwise the trap activates.

Simple trap (level 9-12, deadly, hinder)
A small, circular door approximately three feet across is set
into the wall or natural environment. The path to it seems
well travelled; little footprints can be seen leading to and
from it. In front of the door is a hidden pressure plate.
Trigger (Weight Sensitive Surface). If a Small or smaller
creature steps on the pressure plate the door opens. A Medium
or larger creature stepping on the plate triggers the trap.
Effect (Blindness). All creatures within 15 feet of the door
must succeed a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or go blind
for 1 day. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the
end of every hour, ending the effect for themselves if they
succeed. The effect also ends if dispelled with dispel magic (DC
16), heal , lesser restoration , or similar magic.
Countermeasures. The door has an aura of necromancy
magic when viewed with detect magic. A creature can spot the
pressure plate with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception)
check; a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves’
tools disables the trap.

_Mechanical trap (level 9-12, deadly, harm)_

A pressure plate is concealed in the floor of this corridor,
waiting to release massive, heavy, crescent-shaped blades to
slice through a 15-foot cube, centered on the pressure plate.

**_Trigger (Pressure Plate)_**_._ Stepping on the pressure plate
triggers this trap.

**_Effect (Scything Blades)_**_._ All creatures in the area of the
blades must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 52
(15d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a
successful one. On a failed save a creature is also restrained
as they are pinned against the opposite wall by the blades.

A creature restrained by the blades can free themselves with
a successful DC 20 Constitution (Athletics) check or another
creature can free them with a successful DC 20 Strength
(Medicine) check.

**_Countermeasures (Sensitive)._** A creature can find the
pressure plate with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception)
check; it can be disabled with a successful DC 20 Dexterity
check using thieves’ tools. If the total of the Dexterity check
is 10 or less, the trap activates.

key. If a creature attempts to tamper with the lock in any
way, lightning leaps from the hole of the lock to the creature.

**_Trigger (Attempt to Pick Lock)_**_._ A creature attempting to pick
or tamper with the lock triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Spell Effect)_**_._ A bolt of lightning arcs from the lock
towards the triggering creature. Three bolts then leap from
that creature to as many as three other random creatures,
each of which must be within 30 feet of the first creature. A
creature can be targeted by only one of the bolts.

A creature targeted by a bolt must make a DC 20 Dexterity
saving throw. The creature takes 45 (10d8) lightning damage
on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**_Countermeasures._** WIth a successful DC 20 Wisdom
(Perception) check, a creature can spot some odd-looking
elements inside the lock. Once spotted, a creature that succeeds
on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check understands the trap.

The lock has an aura of evocation magic when viewed with
_detect magic_. Casting _dispel magic_ (DC 16) on the lock disables
the trap. A spellcaster that succeeds on a DC 16 spellcasting
ability check can also disrupt the enchantment on the lock.

## LEVEL 13-16 TRAPS

# V

```
enturing on from our previous unsettling
situation, we arrived at a locked door in a
corridor. Its walls were covered in graven faces
with yawning, hungry mouths. By now, we
knew that sticking around any place like this was likely not
the best idea, so we did what we could to make haste. Our
wizard, sharp as ever, discovered a mechanism nestled in
one of the open mouths and determined that this must open
the uncooperative exit.
Working with delicate devices is one of my many diverse
abilities, so I stepped up to the contraption and set to work.
Because nothing in the world can ever go smoothly, or
perhaps because I am beset by a curse which has doomed
me to wind up in places that want me dead, something
started happening; something that was certainly not the
door unlocking.
The floor started shaking, and split in two! It began edging
ever-wider as the barbarian stood astride the gap (I find this
mildly funny, considering his position in the first hallway
was almost the exact opposite of this). To make matters
worse, the open mouths (except for the one I was working
on) started belching down cascading lava-flows.
```
```
Our cleric did his best to shield us from a nearby lavafall,
as our wizard took to the air, and our ranger clung to the
barbarian’s back for dear life. And then there was, of course,
myself, whose hands were most certainly rock-steady and
not shaking at all at the thought of falling into a gaping
chasm before being excruciatingly boiled alive in molten
earth.
And then, after an eternity of hand-sweat-producing
moments, I felt something and heard every rogue’s favorite
sound in the world: a satisfying click. The lava-drooling
faces ceased their salivation, the floor gap which was
threatening to split our barbarian up the middle retracted,
and the door to go deeper into the temple was now open.
We went through the door, even if at this point it may well
have been against our better judgement...
The traps in this chapter are designed to challenge characters
who are levels 13-16 and are grouped by their lethality.
Any of these traps can be dropped right into a dungeon or
similar adventure and shouldn’t require any preparation.

Effect (Elemental Blast). A surging jet of water shoots forth
from the lock. The triggering creature must succeed on a DC
10 Dexterity saving throw or take 22 (4d10) bludgeoning
damage and be knocked back 15 feet.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 10
Wisdom (Perception) check can hear the gurgle of water
inside the door, and they find the hidden mechanism inside
the keyhole. With a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using
thieves’ tools, a creature can disable the trap.

M
Mechanical trap (level 13-16, setback, harm)
Hanging on the wall of this chamber is a beautifully
constructed mirror, partially covered by a stained linen
throw. The mirror can swing out on hidden hinges to reveal a
small niche behind it.
Trigger (Look Into). A creature that sees its reflection in the
mirror triggers the trap.
Effect (Release Creatures). A doppelganger lurks behind
the mirror. When a creature looks into the mirror, the
doppelganger uses its Read Thoughts action. Since it can now
see the triggering creature in the mirror, the doppelganger
can change its form and deceive the creatures’ companions.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 10
Wisdom (Perception) check can spot the hinges around
the mirror without looking in the mirror. There is nothing
keeping the mirror closed.
```

P P
Mechanical trap (level 13-16, setback, harm)
Dug into the floor of the chamber are ten cylindrical
compartments, each of which has a metal cap. Most of the
caps appear locked in place, save one which is slightly askew.
Trigger (Remove Barrier). Removing the unlocked cap
triggers the trap.
Effect (Darts). A dart fires from the bottom of the
compartment straight up. The trap makes one ranged attack
against the triggering creature with a +5 bonus, dealing 2 (1d4)
piercing damage if it hits. A creature that suffers the piercing
damage must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw, taking
21 (6d6) poison damage and becoming poisoned on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 10
Wisdom (Perception) check can spot a mechanism attached
to the cap, and with a successful DC 10 Intelligence
(Investigation) check they understand the trap.
Once understood, a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using
thieves’ tools disables the trap

Level 13-16 Setback
These traps should present a minor inconvenience to
characters of this level range.

Magic trap (level 13-16, setback, block)
The walls of the dungeon are painted with crude depictions
of rope, chain, and leather bindings.
Trigger (Unconsciousness). A creature that makes another
creature fall unconscious triggers the trap.
Effect (Restraint). The triggering creature and up to 2 others
in the room must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or
be paralyzed for 10 minutes, held by chains of magic force.
At the end of each of its turns, the a paralyzed creature can
make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect
ends on that creature. This effect also ends for all creatures if
dispelled with dispel magic (DC 14).
Countermeasures. If a creature investigates the paintings
and succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) or a DC 10
Intelligence (Arcana) check they can deduce the nature of
the trap. The room also has an aura of enchantment magic
when viewed with detect magic.
A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on this room with
a successful DC 10 spellcasting ability check; casting dispel
magic (DC 14) on the room also disables the trap.

H’  M
Magic trap (level 13-16, setback)
A glyph of warding (magic missile) is inscribed on the wall, ready
to detect the casting of spells.
Trigger (Cast Spell). A creature that casts a spell within 40
feet of the glyph triggers the trap.
Effect (Spell Effect). The glyph casts magic missile as a 4th-
level spell. Six glowing darts of magical energy hit the
triggering creature; each dart deals 1d4 + 1 force damage.
Countermeasures. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence
(History) check, a creature can remember some detail about
this room or area, and is aware of the trap.
The glyph can be found with detect magic , or with a successful
DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Once found, it can
be disabled with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana)
check or with dispel magic.

Magic trap (level 13-16, setback, hinder)
An important object sits on a pedestal or lies in a chest. The
object is enchanted to lignify (turn to wood) anyone who
touches it.
Trigger (Touch Object). A creature that touches the object
triggers the trap.
Effect (Petrification). The triggering creature must make
a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
creatures are restrained as their flesh begins to harden.
On a successful save, the creature isn’t affected. A creature
restrained by this effect must make a DC 10 Constitution
saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully
saves against this effect three times, the effect ends for that
creature. If it fails its save three times, it is turned into an
inanimate wooden doll and petrified. The successes and
failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until
the creature collects three of a kind.
This effect lasts for 10 minutes or until dispelled, either
with dispel magic (DC 14) or greater restoration. If a creature
is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from similar
deformities if it reverts to its original state.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 10
Intelligence (History) check recognizes the object and
understands the danger of the trap. The object has an aura
of transmutation when viewed with detect magic.
A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the object with
a successful DC 10 spellcasting ability check; dispel magic (DC
14) also disables the trap.

Mechanical trap (level 13-16, setback, harm)
A 60-foot deep vertical shaft is hidden under a trapdoor
disguised to look like the rest of the floor. The trapdoor
covers a 5-foot square space and has a pressure plate
embedded in it.
Trigger (Pressure Plate). A creature that steps on the
trapdoor activates the pressure plate, and the trap door
swings open.
Effect (Drop Into Empty Pit). The triggering creature must
make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a success the creature
is able to grab onto the edge of the pit. On a failure, the creature
falls into the pit and takes 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage.
Countermeasures. With a successful DC 10 Wisdom
(Perception) check, a creature can find the pressure plate and
trapdoor. A successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves’
tools disables the trap.

_Mechanical trap (level 13-16, setback)_

A rope dangles in an enticing place, seemingly meant to
reveal something or open a door. The rope is attached to a
vessel high above. When it’s pulled, the rope goes slack and
the vessel falls.

**_Trigger (Pull Chain/Rope)_**_._ A creature that pulls on the rope
triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Falling Object)_**_._ A ceramic vessel containing several
gallons of a slimey acidic substance comes crashing to the
floor, spreading the slime in all directions. All creatures within
a 10-foot sphere centered on the triggering creature must
make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) acid
damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

**_Countermeasures._** A creature that succeeds on a DC 10
Wisdom (Perception) check can spot the vessel attached to
the rope. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation)
check, a creature can deduce that the rope leads nowhere
and can just be avoided.

T N

_Hybrid trap (level 13-16, setback)_

Various ornate carvings and symbols adorn panels on the
wall of this room. One panel has been inscribed with a _glyph
of warding (sleep)_ , hidden among the arcane writing.

**_Trigger (Tap/Prod)_**_._ A creature that taps, prods, knocks on,
pushes, pulls, or disturbs a panel in any way triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Spell Effect)_**_._ The glyph casts _sleep_ as a 4th-level spell,
sending creatures into a magical slumber. The spell can
affect 49 (11d8) hit points of creatures. Creatures within 20
feet of a point next to the triggering creature are affected
in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring
unconscious creatures).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit
points, each creature affected by this spell falls unconscious
for 1 minute, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses
an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each
creature’s hit points from the total before moving on to the
creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit
points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for
that creature to be affected.

Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren’t
affected by this spell.

**_Countermeasures._** With a successful DC 10 Intelligence
(Investigation) check, a creature can find the glyph without
setting off the trap.

Once found, the glyph can be disabled with a successful DC
10 Intelligence (Arcana) check, or with _dispel magic_.

C  I	
Mechanical trap (level 13-16, moderate, block)
A golden staff, capped with a ruby orb, stands in a metal
frame in this room. The staff looks incredibly valuable and it
is placed on a dais with a spiraling pattern of tiles od atop it.
Trigger (Pick Up/Shift Object). Extracting the staff from the
stand triggers the trap.
Effect (Net). The trap releases a net of chains onto all
creatures within 10 feet of the staff who must make DC 12
Dexterity saving throws. A creature that fails is trapped
under the net and restrained, and creatures that succeed
avoid the net. The links of the chains glow with celestial
light, and any creature that starts its turn restrained by the
net takes 22 (4d10) radiant damage.
A creature restrained by the net can use its action to make
a DC 12 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature
within its reach on a success. On a failure, the creature takes
11 (2d10) radiant damage
The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing
damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section
of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 12
Wisdom (Perception) check spots the mechanisms attached
to the stand; with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using
thieves’ tools, a creature can disable the trap.
A creature can attempt to replace the staff with something
of equal weight. To attempt this, a creature makes a DC 12
Intelligence (Perception) check to estimate the weight of the
staff, then a DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to make
the switch; failure on either check triggers the trap.
```
```
C D
Hybrid trap (level 13-16, moderate, block)
This room is decorated in a highly gothic fashion, featuring a
large, vicious-looking steel chandelier covered in barbs and
spikes. The chandelier is not suspended from the ceiling but
from chains connected to the walls.
Trigger (Pass Area). A creature that passes directly beneath
the chandelier steps on a pressure plate, opening a trapdoor.
Effect (Teleporting Drop). The 10-foot square trapdoor
opens, revealing a 20-foot deep pit with a portal at the
bottom. An identical portal appears on the ceiling, the
chandelier in between.
Creatures on the trapdoor when it opens must succeed on a
DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the pit. A creature
who falls into the pit passes through the bottom portal, out the
ceiling portal, through the chandelier, and into the pit again,
looping through the portals each round. Each time a creature
falls through the chandelier they take 3 (1d6) slashing damage.
This damage increases by 3 (1d6) for each time a creature has
passed through the chandelier (1d6 the first time, 2d6 the
second, 3d6, the third, etc...).
```
```
T S
Mechanical trap (level 13-16, setback, harm)
Passing through this area requires raising a well-constructed
steel gate using a crank. The gate is bordered on both sides by
small, round, openings.
Trigger (Turn Wheel/Crank). Turning the crank triggers
the trap.
Effect (Bolts). An array of crossbows hidden inside the
turrets fires toward the crank. The trap makes four attacks
against the triggering creature with a +5 bonus to the rolls,
dealing 5 (1d10) piercing damage on a hit.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 10
Wisdom (Perception) check can spot the bolts hidden
inside the openings. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence
(Investigation) check, a creature understands the trap.
Once understood, a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using
thieves’ tools disables the trap.

B C
Hybrid trap (level 13-16, moderate, harm)
On the floor of this circular room are four pedestals and in
the center is a wooden crate containing four items; a set of
manacles, an iron shovel, an oil lamp, and a glass prism. The
only other exit from the chamber is a locked portcullis. A
rune of detection is worked into the floor of the room.
Trigger (Wrong Combination). If the objects are placed in
the correct order (manacles in the north, shovel to the east,
lamp to the south, prism to the west), the portcullis opens.
Otherwise, the trap activates.
Effect (Falling Objects). Burning coals fall from the ceiling
around the pedestals. Each creature within 10 feet of a
pedestal must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a
failure, a creature takes 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and
14 (4d6) fire damage. On a success, a creature takes half the
bludgeoning damage, and none of the fire damage.
Countermeasures. Clues to the correct order for the items
are scattered around the room as part of the decorations; a
creature that succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check
can deduce the proper sequence.
The rune can be found with a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check
or with detect magic. Once found, the rune can be disabled with
dispel magic or a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check.
The portcullis is firmly locked down; only a successful DC 20
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools will release it.

Magic trap (level 13-16, moderate, block)
A glyph of warding (wall of force) prevents creatures wielding
weapons from proceeding. Any creature that draws a
weapon or carries a drawn weapon into the enchanted area
will trigger a wall of force to block their way forward or their
way back, or both.
Trigger (Unsheathe Weapon). A creature that draws a
weapon in the area or enters the area with a weapon drawn
triggers the trap.
Effect (Spell Effect). When activated, the glyph casts wall of
force , creating an invisible vertical barrier that blocks passage
forward. The wall is 1/4 inch thick and lasts for 10 minutes. If
the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the
creature is pushed to a random side of the wall (your choice
which side).
Countermeasures. The glyph can be found with a successful
DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Once found, it
can be disabled with dispel magic or with a successful DC 12
Intelligence (Arcana) check.
```
A creature can attempt to stop their loop by grabbing onto the
chandelier with a successful DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.

**_Countermeasures._** A creature can spot the pressure plate
with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check; it can
be disabled with a successful DC 12 Dexterity check using
thieves’ tools. The portals can each be dispelled with _dispel
magic_ (DC 15).

_Simple trap (level 13-16, moderate, harm)_

A section of the floor is littered with pressure plates. A
creature that steps on one of them will set off a grid of
flaming spires that shoot up from the floor.

**_Trigger (Pressure Plate)_**_._ A creature that steps on a pressure
plate triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Fire Blast)_**_._ Several spouts of flame suddenly erupt
from the floor in a 10-foot-by-10-foot square centered on
the trigger pressure plate. All creatures in the area must
make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) fire
damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.

**_Countermeasures._** With a successful DC 12 Wisdom
(Perception) check, a creature can find the pressure plates. A
successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables
a single pressure plate, but a check with a total of 5 or lower
triggers the trap.

H H

_Magic trap (level 13-16, moderate, hinder)_

The mouthpiece to a large horn extends out from the wall
of this room. When blown, the horn curses its user with
invisibility.

**_Trigger (Musical/Auditory)_**_._ A creature that blows the horn
triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Invisibility)_**_._ The creature blowing the horn must
make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become invisible
for 8 hours or until dispelled ( _dispel magic_ DC 16). Anything
the creature is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is
on the target’s person.

**_Countermeasures_**_._ The horn has an aura of illusion magic
when viewed with _detect magic._ A creature that succeeds on a
DC 12 Intelligence (History) check recognizes the writings and
etchings on the horn and understands the danger of the trap.

A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the horn with
a successful DC 12 spellcasting ability check; _dispel magic_ (DC
16) also disables the trap.

creature. If it fails its save three times, it is turned into a
statue made of silver. The successes and failures don’t need
to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature
collects three of a kind.
This effect lasts for 8 hours, or until dispelled, either with
dispel magic or greater restoration. If a creature is physically
broken while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if
it reverts to its original state.
Countermeasures. The statuette has an aura of
transmutation magic when viewed with detect magic. With
a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Religion) check, a creature

Simple trap (level 13-16, moderate, block)
The grove of giant oaks is dappled by sunlight. In the centre
of the clearing, surrounded by a circle of stones and dozens of
red-capped toadstools, is a heavily scratched wooden trapdoor.
Trigger (Open/Close Object). Opening the trapdoor triggers
the trap.
Effect (Snare). A thorned vine attached to a mechanical arm
whips around the triggering creature. The triggering creature
must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 33
(6d10) slashing damage and be restrained until it is freed.
The vine has AC 11, 10 hit points, resistance to bludgeoning
damage, and vulnerability to fire and slashing damage.
At the beginning of each of its turns, a creature restrained
by the snare takes an additional 11 (2d10) slashing damage.
A creature restrained by the snare can free themselves with
a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check, or they can be
free by another creature that succeeds on a DC 12 Strength
(Medicine) check.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the snare and a successful DC 12 Dexterity
check using thieves’ tools disables the trap.

Mechanical trap (level 13-16, moderate, hinder)
A door or chest is closed and secured with a combination
lock. The lock consists of three dials, each of which has runic
symbols. The correct combination unlocks the lock, the
wrong combination is perilous.
Trigger (Wrong Combination). A creature that enters the
wrong combination triggers the trap.
Effect (Needle). A poison needle springs out from the lock
mechanism. The triggering creature must make a DC 12
Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 21
(6d6) poison damage and is poisoned for 10 minutes. While
poisoned in this way, the creature is paralyzed. On a success,
the creature takes half the poison damage and isn’t poisoned.
Countermeasures. A creature can recognize the lock
and remember its combination with a successful DC
12 Intelligence (History) check, and a successful DC 12
Intelligence (Investigation) check lets a creature spot the
hidden needle.
Once found, the needle mechanism can be disarmed with a
successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.

Mechanical trap (level 13-16, moderate)
A poorly disguised tripwire is easily detected, but it hides the
real trap that is set to go off if the decoy is tampered with.
Trigger (False Trigger). Disarming or attempting to disarm
the false trigger sets off the real trap.
Effect (Random). Randomly select a mechanical trap of the
same or lower lethality and use its effect.
Countermeasures (Difficult). A successful DC 12 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the false trigger. A successful DC
12 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals its true nature. A
successful DC 12 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables
the real trap.

A jade statuette carved to resemble a hissing serpent rests
on an altar. Its eyes are made from silver spheres, and silver
coins are strewn on the ground before the statuette.
Trigger (Insult Idol). Failure to place a silver coin at the
statuette’s base before leaving the room triggers the trap.
Effect (Petrification). The triggering creature must make
a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature is restrained as their flesh begins to harden. On
a successful save, the creature isn’t affected. A creature
restrained by this effect must make a DC 12 Constitution
saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully
saves against this effect three times, the effect ends for that

Countermeasures. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (History
or Religion) check reveals the intent of the symbols on the
walls, and the room has an aura of evocation magic when
viewed with detect magic.
A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the room with
a successful DC 15 spellcasting ability check; dispel magic (DC
14) also disables the trap. Providing a sacrifice disables this
trap for 24 hours.

Hybrid trap (level 13-16, dangerous, harm)
In the chamber there sits a stone statue atop a tall pedestal.
The statue’s right hand is extended and on it rests a silver
bowl. The idol must be presented an offering to assure safe
passage to the next chamber. Those who fail to appease the
idol will be punished.
Trigger. A creature that doesn’t present the idol with
satisfactory offering triggers the trap.
Effect. One or more creatures are released from one or
more cages embedded in the walls of the chamber. The
released creature(s) should be thematically and challenge
rating appropriate.
Countermeasures. The detect magic spell causes an aura to
illuminate the idol. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana)
check once it is discovered reveals the nature of the trigger.

G	
Simple trap (level 13-16, dangerous, block)
Dappled light filters through an enormous, sealed tank of
water that takes up half of the empty room. A statue stands
outside the tank with an outstretched hand, and a matching
statue but with clenched fists is inside the tank.
Trigger (Offering). If a creature walks past the open-handed
statue without placing a gold coin into it, they trigger the trap.
Effect (Swap). The target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma
saving throw or instantly switch places with the clenched-
fist statue. If they cannot breathe water, they must hold their
breath and may start to suffocate. The glass tank has AC 15, 100
hit points, immunity to slashing, poison, and psychic damage,
and vulnerability to piercing and bludgeoning damage.
Giving a coin to the open-handed statue swaps the statue
and creature again, but dispelling or disrupting the
enchantment doesn’t.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Religion)
check lets a creature recognize the statue and understand
the trap. With detect magic , the statues have an aura of
conjuration magic.
A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the statues with
a successful DC 15 spellcasting ability check. Casting dispel
magic (DC 16) on the statues also disables the trap.

_Mechanical trap (level 13-16, dangerous, harm)_

This wooden cabinet has a built-in lock, surrounded by an
ornately etched plate of silver. The cabinet itself seems to
have been stabbed in multiple places, though none of the
marks are deep enough to penetrate the wood.

**_Trigger (Attempt to Pick Lock)._** A creature that attempts to
pick the lock triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Spears)._** A bank of spears shoots out from the wall
opposite the cabinet. The triggering creature must make
a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) piercing
damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

**_Countermeasures._** With a successful DC 15 Wisdom
(Perception) check, a creature can spot the mechanisms in
the lock; a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’
tools disables the trap.

B
 B

_Simple trap (level 13-16, dangerous, block)_

Frozen piles of ash are scattered across the floor of this ice
cavern. Dark symbols of a demonic cult are carved into the
wall. To those who can understand them, the symbols make
it clear that going further into the cave complex requires the
sacrifice of a living, thinking creature.

**_Trigger (Mortal Sacrifice)._** If a sentient creature is not
killed before entering the chamber beyond this one, the
trap is triggered.

**_Effect (Wall of Fire)._** When activated, the trap creates a wall
of fire up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The
wall is opaque and blocks further entry into the caves.

When the wall appears, each creature within its area must
make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a
creature takes 22 (5d8) fire damage, or half as much damage
on a successful save.

The side of the wall facing into this room deals 22 (5d8) fire
damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of
that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage
when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its
turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.

The wall lasts for 8 hours or until dispelled with _dispel magic_
(DC 14).

Effect (Crushing Ceiling/Walls). The ceiling moves at a
rate of 1 foot per round at the end of the initiative order.
Once the surface reaches a creature’s space, they take
1d10 bludgeoning damage. If the surface is still moving
on the next turn, the creature is restrained and takes 2d10
bludgeoning damage. A third round spent being crushed
inflicts 4d10 bludgeoning damage, the fourth and every
round thereafter inflicts 10d10 bludgeoning damage. After 7
rounds, the ceiling reaches the floor and then retracts.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the spider webs and with a successful DC 15

Magic trap (level 13-16, dangerous, hinder)
The stairwell ahead is painted with bright colours in
confusing, hypnotic patterns that make it unclear when one
step ends and another begins.
Trigger (Fail to Speak Password). A creature that enters the
stairwell without uttering the word ‘reveal’ triggers the trap.
Effect (Amnesia). A hazy fog fills the triggering creature’s
mind and it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On
a failure, the creature forgets the previous 1d10 days; these
memories form in the magical paint on the staircase. The
memories return after 8 hours; greater restoration or similar
magic also restores the lost memories.
Countermeasures. The patterns in the stairwell can be seen
from outside it, and with a successful DC 15 Intelligence
(Arcana) check a creature realizes the nature of the trap.
Detect magic reveals an aura of enchantment magic around
the stairwell.
A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment with a successful
DC 15 spellcasting ability check; dispel magic (DC 16) also
disables the trap.

Mechanical trap (level 13-16, dangerous, harm)
A closed book’s cover is connected to a mechanism
restraining spikes in a nearby surface. Opening the book
without disarming the connection will release the spikes.
Trigger (Open/Close Object). A creature that opens the book
triggers the trap.
Effect (Spears). Spears drop from a nearby surface, thrusting
into the 5-foot spaces adjacent to the book. A creature in the
threatened area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw,
taking 66 (12d10) piercing damage on a failed save or half as
much on a successful one.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)

Simple trap (level 13-16, dangerous, harm)
The door ahead is closed and locked, but it can be picked
with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.
However, a failed attempt releases a trap door that drops the
target into a spiked pit.
Trigger (Fail to Pick Lock). A creature that attempts to pick
the lock and fails triggers the trap.
Effect (Drop Into Spiked Pit). The floor drops out from
under the triggering creature, which must make a DC 15
Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature
is able to grab onto the edge of the spiked pit. On a failed
save, the creature falls into the spiked pit and takes 17 (5d6)
bludgeoning damage and 49 (14d6) piercing damage.
Countermeasures (Difficult). With a successful DC 15
Wisdom (Perception) check, a creature can spot the
mechanisms inside the lock but doesn’t know exactly what
they do. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check
lets a creature understand the trap.

Hybrid trap (level 13-16, perilous, hinder)
The room is filled with beautiful sculptures of beasts,
standing on ornate stands and plinths. Each has a unique
design, and must have been the pinnacle of the artists’ career.
A thin, transparent wire stretches between two of the plinths.
Trigger (Tripwire). A creature that snaps the wire triggers
the trap.
Effect (Transmutation). When activated, a burst of purple
energy washes over the triggering creature, transforming it
into a random beast unless they succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom
saving throw. The trap has no effect on a shapechanger or a
creature with 0 hit points.
The transformation lasts 8 hours or until dispelled; the
transformation also ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points
or dies. The new form can be any beast whose challenge
rating is equal to or less than the creature’s. The creature’s
game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced
by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment
and personality.
The creature assumes the hit points of its new form. When
it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the
number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it
reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess
damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess
damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit
points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.
The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the
nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take
any other action that requires hands or speech.
The creature’s gear melds into the new form; it can’t activate,
use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception)
check lets a creature spot the tripwire, and with a successful
DC 17 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools a creature can
disable the trap.
The plinths with the tripwire each have an aura of
transmutation magic when viewed with detect magic. A
spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the plinths with
a successful DC 17 spellcasting ability check; dispel magic (DC
14) also disables the trap.

_Magic trap (level 13-16, dangerous, block)_

This chamber’s vaulted ceiling is 120-feet high, and is
marked by archways and alcoves. Blocking your exit from
the cathedral-like room is a portcullis, beside which is a
hefty iron lever. A _glyph of warding (reverse gravity)_ is inscribed
on the lever.

**_Trigger (Move Lever/Press Button)._** Pulling the lever triggers
the trap and also raises the portcullis.

**_Effect (Spell Effect)._** When activated, the glyph casts _reverse
gravity_. All creatures and objects in a 50-foot radius, 100-
foot high cylinder centered on the triggering creature
that aren’t somehow anchored to the ground fall upward
and reach the top of the area. A creature can make a DC
15 Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can
reach, thus avoiding the fall.

After 1 minute, or if dispelled with _dispel magic_ (DC 17),
affected objects and creatures fall back down, taking 55
(10d6) bludgeoning damage.

**_Countermeasures._** A creature can spot the glyph with a
successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, or with
_detect magic_. Once found, the glyph can be disabled with a
successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check or with _dispel magic_.

_Magic trap (level 13-16, dangerous, harm)_

A crystal ball hovers in this room, glowing and pulsing due
to the raging lightning storm captured inside.

**_Trigger (Look Into)_**_._ A creature within 10 feet of the crystal
ball that looks into it triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Elemental Blast)_**_._ A stroke of lightning forming a
line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts out from the crystal,
aimed at the triggering creature. Each creature in the line
must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes
35 (11d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that
aren’t being worn or carried.

**_Countermeasures._** With a successful DC 15 Wisdom
(Perception) check, a creature spots blasts and scorch marks
on the walls of this room. A creature that succeeds on a DC
15 Intelligence (Arcana) check can understand the nature of
the trap without triggering it. If viewed with _detect magic_ , the
crystal has an aura of evocation magic.

A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the crystal
with a successful DC 15 spellcasting ability check; casting
_dispel magic_ (DC 16) on the crystal also disables the trap.
Either way, the lightning storm dissipates harmlessly with a
loud crack of thunder.

Trigger (Interact with Bait). Opening the skull’s mouth
triggers the trap.
Effect (Needle). A poisoned needle in the skull's mouth
pierces the creature that opened the skull. That creature
must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, the target takes 22 (4d10) poison damage and 22 (4d10)
necrotic damage and is poisoned. While poisoned in this
way, the creature must make another DC 17 Constitution
saving throw every hour or take an additional 11 (2d10)
necrotic damage. The creature is no longer poisoned after 4
hours or once they succeed on 2 Constitution saving throws
to resist the additional damage.
Countermeasures. A creature can spot the hidden needle
with a successful DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check;
with a successful DC 17 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check a
creature can open the skull without triggering the trap.
The trap can be disabled with a successful DC 17 Dexterity

Magic trap (level 13-16, perilous, harm)
Thick, black tar stains the tapestry hanging on the wall,
concealing a hidden door. The masterpiece of thread work
has been ruined by the tar, which is formed into a glyph of
warding (prismatic spray).
Trigger (Creature Detector). A good creature that approaches
within 5 feet of the tapestry triggers the trap.
Effect (Spell Effect). When activated the glyph casts prismatic
spray. Eight multicolored rays of light flash from the glyph.
Each ray is a different color and has a different power and
purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a
DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8 to
determine which color ray affects it.
```
**1. Red:** The target takes 35 (10d6) fire damage on a failed
    save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
**2. Orange:** The target takes 35 (10d6) acid damage on a
    failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
**3. Yellow:** The target takes 35 (10d6) lightning damage on a
    failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
**4. Green:** The target takes 35 (10d6) poison damage on a

**5. Blue:** The target takes 35 (10d6) cold damage on a failed
    save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
**6. Indigo:** On a failed save, the target is restrained. It must
    then make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw at the end
    of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times,
    the spell ends. If it fails its save three times, it perma-
    nently turns to stone and is subjected to the petrified
    condition. The successes and failures don’t need to be
    consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects
    three of a kind.

Mechanical trap (level 13-16, perilous, block)
A complex clockwork mechanism takes up the majority
of this workshop. It whirrs and buzzes like a living insect,
spinning and gyrating in place. In front of the mechanism is
a panel of buttons and levers.
Trigger (Move Lever/Press Button). Most of the buttons
and levers control the workings of the machine. One of the
buttons is false: pressing it triggers the trap.
Effect (Barrier). A 5-foot tall, 10-foot wide barrier of
whirling blades shoots up from the floor 5 feet behind the
control panel, trapping creatures there. A creature that
approaches or starts its turn within 5 feet of the barrier
must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6)
slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a
successful one.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception)
check lets a creature spot the top of the bladed wall,
flush with the ceiling. A successful DC 17 Intelligence
(Investigation) check reveals the false button, and allows
a creature to attempt a DC 17 Dexterity check while using

On the ceiling of this chamber are nasty barbs that look like
meat or fish hooks. The walls and floor are splattered with
blood, and the entire place is dimly lit by a single brazier. A
metal door with a grated window marks the exit.
Trigger (Tension Cable). A taut cable is fixed between the
metal door and the floor. Opening the door triggers the trap.
Effect (Spring Floor). All creatures in the room are flung up into
the ceiling and must make a DC 17 Dexterity check. On a failure,
the creature takes 28 (8d6) piercing damage and becomes
grappled by the hooks on the ceiling (escape DC 17). On a
success, the creature takes half the damage and isn’t grappled.
A creature that fails their ability check to escape from the
hooks takes an additional 28 (8d6) piercing damage.

Magic trap (level 13-16, perilous, subdue)
An important or significant object has been enchanted to put
creatures that remove it from its resting place into a deep sleep.
Trigger (Remove Object). A creature that removes the object
from its current location triggers the trap.
Effect (Sleep). The enchantment can affect 76 (17d8)
hit points of creatures. Creatures within 20 feet of the
enchanted object are affected in ascending order of their
current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures). Starting
with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each
creature affected falls unconscious for 8 hours, or until the
sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or
slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature’s hit points
from the total before moving on to the creature with the next
lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or
less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.
Undead and creatures immune to being charmed aren’t
affected by this spell.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 17
Intelligence (History) check recognizes the object and knows
about the trap. The object has an aura of enchantment magic
when viewed with detect magic.
A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the object
with a successful DC 17 spellcasting ability check; dispel magic
(DC17) can also disable the trap.

**7. Violet:** On a failed save, the target is blinded. It must
    then make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw at the start of
    your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If
    it fails that save, the creature is transported to another
    plane of existence of the GM’s choosing and is no longer
    blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t
    its home plane is banished home, while other creatures
    are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)
**8. Special:** The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice
    more, rerolling any 8.

**_Countermeasures._** The glyph can be found with _detect magic_

_Mechanical trap (level 13-16, perilous, block)_

This sandstone tomb is filled with decrepit statues of old
kings and queens. Steps lead up to a towering gold statue of
a jackal-headed goddess-queen. A pressure plate is hidden
on the final step.

**_Trigger (Pressure Plate)._** Stepping on the pressure plate
triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Falling Sand)._** The statue’s mouth opens and sand
begins to pour into the tomb. Creatures in the area must
make successful DC 17 Dexterity saving throws at the
beginning of their turns to stay atop the sand. The save DC
increases by 2 at the end of each round.

A creature that fails one saving throw is buried up to their
knees and restrained. On their next saving throw, if the
creature succeeds they dig themselves out and are no longer
restrained; if they fail they are buried waist-deep and
remain restrained.

A creature buried waist-deep must make a DC 17 Strength
saving throw at the beginning of their turn; if they succeed
they dig themselves free of the sand and if they fail they are
buried to the neck and immobilized. On their next turn, the
creature is completely buried and starts suffocating.

As an action, a creature can dig out another creature with
a successful DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check against the
current save DC of the trap. Spells like _freedom of movement_
or movement modes like burrow can also allow creatures to
freely move through the sand.

Mechanical trap (level 13-16, deadly, harm)
A 1-foot thick ring of decorative stonework surrounds a
25-foot diameter circle area in the center of the room. The
ceiling directly above the ring is blackened with soot. In the
5-foot square at the circle’s center is something intriguing.
Trigger (Weight Sensitive Floor). When a Small or larger
creature steps onto a space adjacent to the 5-foot square
at the center of the area within the ring, they activate a
pressure plate. Parts of the stonework slide away, revealing
spouts which pour flaming oil onto the floor from the ring’s
inner edge.
Effect (Wall of Fire). The flaming oil creates a ringed wall of
flames 25 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The
wall is opaque and lasts for 1 minute. When the wall appears,
each creature within its area must make a DC 20 Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 70 (20d6) fire
damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
The side of the wall facing inwards deals the trap’s fire
damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of
that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage
when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its
turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.
A creature that is adjacent to the wall can make a DC 20
Constitution check using thieves’ tools to end this effect.

A glyph of warding ( forcecage) is written on the wall, floor, or
ceiling. When a creature gets too close the glyph activates.
Trigger (Creature Detector). A creature that gets within 5
feet of the glyph triggers the trap.
Effect (Spell Effect). When activated, the glyph casts forcecage.
An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped cage composed of
magical force springs into existence around the triggering
creature. The prison is 20 feet on a side and is made from
1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.
Any creature that is completely inside the cage’s area when it
comes into being is trapped. Creatures only partially within
the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed
away from the center of the area until they are completely
outside the area.
A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by non-magical
means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar
travel to leave the cage, it must first make a DC 12 Charisma
saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to
exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can’t exit the cage and
wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into
the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
This spell can’t be dispelled by dispel magic and it lasts for
1 hour.
Countermeasures. The glyph can be found with detect magic
or with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation)
check. Once found, the glyph can be disabled with dispel
magic or with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

Effect (Crushing Ceiling/Walls). The walls move at a rate of
1 foot per round at the end of the initiative order. Once the
surface reaches a creature’s space, they take 1d10 bludgeoning
damage. If the surface is still moving on the next turn, the

with a pickaxe and shield. A shrine to dwarven deities of the
forge is on ground level.
Trigger (No Command Word). Using a wand, rod, ring, orb,

Effect (Swap). A triggering creature must succeed on a DC
20 Charisma save, or instantly switch places with the statue.
The statue animates as a clay golem and attacks all non-
dwarfs in the shrine. The golem will not leave the shrine, and
if reduced to 0 hit points it crumbles to dust.
If a creature falls from the pinnacle into the lava they take 35

damage from the lava. They take the fire damage again at the
end of their turn if they remain submerged.

them. Enchanted ballistas are hidden in these boulders.

**_Trigger (Bring Object)._** Approaching the cliff face with
any magic item or non-magical contraption that allows a
creature to fly or glide triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Bolts)._** Hidden inside two of the boulders are _+3
ballistas_ loaded with _bolts of humanoid slaying_. A creature that
triggers the trap is targeted with two ranged attacks from
these ballistas, each of which have a +15 bonus, and deal
19 (3d10 + 3) piercing damage on a hit. If the target hit is a
humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving

Mechanical trap (level 13-16, deadly, harm)
The floor in this room is painted with an optical illusion
which makes it look like a pit of snakes.
Trigger (Weight Sensitive Surface). A Medium or larger
creature that steps on the floor triggers the trap.
Effect (Drop Into Lair). The triggering creature must succeed
on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or fall 100 feet into a pit
which opens beneath them like a trapdoor, taking 35 (10d6)
bludgeoning damage. At the bottom of the pit are 5 swarms
of poisonous snakes.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the trigger, and a successful DC 20 Dexterity
check while using thieves’ tools disables the trigger.

Hybrid trap (level 13-16, deadly)
A large chamber has a floor covered in strange runes and
symbols, including a rune of detection. Casting within the
chamber activates the rune, which collapses the floor.
Creatures within the chamber fall fifty feet into a pit filled
with 25-foot deep water.
Trigger (Cast Spell). Casting a spell in the chamber triggers
the trap.
Effect (Drop). The floor of the chamber falls away, starting at
the center and moving out toward the walls. Each creature in
the room must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a
success, the creature is able to grab onto the edge of the pit. On
a failure, the creature falls into the pit below. Creatures close to
the center of the chamber have disadvantage on their saving
throw, while creatures close to the walls have advantage.
The pit is 50 feet deep and half-filled with water; climbing
out of it requires a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics)
check. After each hour in the pit, a creature must succeed on
a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or begin suffocating.
Countermeasures. The rune can be found with a successful
DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, and with a successful DC
20 Intelligence (History) check a creature can recall some
details and bits of lore about this trap.
Once found, the rune can be disabled with a successful DC
20 Intelligence (Arcana) check.
Detect magic can be used to find the rune, and dispel magic can
disable it, but casting either spell inside the room triggers
the trap.

Magic trap (level 13-16, deadly, block)
In this room is a statue of a dignified, regal woman holding
a golden quill in one hand, and a diamond shaped shield in
the other.
Trigger (Insult Idol). A creature that is libellous, scandalous,
or rude in the statue’s presence triggers the trap.
Effect (Wall of Force). An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped
prison composed of magical force springs into existence
around the triggering creature. The prison is 10 feet on a
side, creating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from
passing through it and blocking any spells cast into or out
from the area.
Any creature that is completely inside the cage’s area when
the trap is activated is trapped. Creatures only partially
within the area, or those too large to fit inside the area,
are pushed away from the center of the area until they are
completely outside the area.
A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by non-magical
means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar
travel to leave the cage, it must first make a DC 20 Charisma
saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to
exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can’t exit the cage and
wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into
the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
The prison can’t be dispelled by dispel magic ; it fades away
after 1 day. Apologising to the statue with a successful DC 20
Charisma (Religion) check dispels the prison.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 20
Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes the statue and
understands the trap. The statue has an aura of evocation
magic when viewed with detect magic.
A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the statue with
a successful DC 20 spellcasting ability check; dispel magic (DC
17) also disables the trap.

Hybrid trap (level 13-16, deadly)
When a creature enters this room, a magical mouth (as
per the magic mouth spell) appears on the wall asking for a
password. This question could take the form of a simple
request or a riddle and should be something that pertains to
the surrounding area. A rune of detection is inscribed on the
wall opposite the mouth.
Trigger (Command Word). Not speaking the password
triggers the trap.
Effect (Poison Gas). When activated, the rune releases valves
that create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-
green fog centered on the middle of the room. The fog
spreads around corners. It lasts 10 minutes or until strong
wind disperses the fog. Its area is heavily obscured.
When a creature enters the fog’s area for the first time on a
turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a DC

**_e arrived in a great chamber, a vaulted ceiling
soaring high overhead. Massive statues stood
along the walls, hands raised as if saluting
our valiant and unflinching resolve to get to
this point. Perhaps this temple was built with so many traps
as a sort of trial, a test of mettle and fortitude, if you will.
This would certainly make sense, for there, unguarded and
awaiting us, was the artifact._**

**_As a group we all proceeded forward, intent on experiencing
this long-awaited moment together. We stood around
the artifact and took it (I won’t say who actually took it,
that’s for me to know). We waited a moment, sure that
something terrible was about to happen, but nothing did.
We looked at one another, hesitantly smiled, then quickly
devolved into laughter, cheers, hugs, and rejoicing in our
accomplishment. We walked out of the room, and out of
that awful temple for good._**

**_... At least, that’s what I’d hoped would happen. Oh, there
were cheers and much rejoicing and all that, but as soon
as we started to walk away, everything gave way in an
almighty lurch. We saw the massive granite statues sway
ominously as streams of dust cascaded down from the
ceiling high above. Cracks raced along the walls and up into
the ceiling itself as the whole place started coming down._**

```
Dazzling beams of sunlight streamed through as huge
chunks of the ceiling broke free and slammed down around
us. We darted left and right, avoiding them as best we could.
There was a low groaning sound from above, which made
our wizard say something I’ll not repeat here. One of the
towering statues was falling straight toward us. While most
of us reflexively screamed and futilely tried to brace for what
was coming, our wizard stood tall, stretching out an arm as
if mocking the gigantic carving.
As she screamed in defiance, a shimmering orb of force
bloomed around us just as the incalculable tons of stone
slammed into it. The world was filled with nothing but dust,
grit, and the sound of rattling stone. I opened my eyes and
saw my companions doing the same. We weren't’ smears
on the ground! We were alive! As the dust settled, we looked
around at the wreckage, and those sunbeams sliced through
the gloom as a final, divine reward for our work.
It was finally time to go home.
The traps in this chapter are designed to challenge characters
who are levels 17-20 and are grouped by their lethality.
Any of these traps can be dropped right into a dungeon or
similar adventure and shouldn’t require any preparation.

Chapter Six | Level 17-20 Traps 73

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make
a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the
character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save,
the character’s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a
successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level
of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.
Countermeasures. The rune and hidden nozzle can be
spotted with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check.
Once found, the rune can be disabled with a successful DC 10
Intelligence (Arcana) check, or with dispel magic.

Multiple shadowed alcoves line the walls of this shrine.
Beside the door on a small plinth is a gleaming silver
lantern. Flammable oil is held in place by a thin wax coating
on the inside upper surface of the lantern.
Trigger (Activate Light Fixture). Lighting the lantern
triggers the trap.
Effect (Acid/Slime Blast). Sticky, flammable oil pours forth
from the lamp, setting the triggering creature on fire. The
triggering creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving
throw or be covered in flaming oil and take 11 (2d10) fire
damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end
this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity
check to extinguish the flames and scrape off the oil.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 10
Wisdom (Perception) check can spot the hidden oil, and with
a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) check a creature
understands the danger of the trap.
The oil can be easily scraped out of the lantern, or washed

_Magic trap (level 17-20, setback, subdue)_

A door or archway is enchanted to allow only certain
creatures to pass freely. Any who do not match the
qualifications attempting to pass are teleported elsewhere,
usually somewhere they would rather not be.

**_Trigger (Creature Detector)_**_._ The trap is keyed to certain
criteria of creatures, including physical characteristics, race,
type, and alignment. If a creature meeting the requirements
for safe passage passes the threshold, the trap is
deactivated for 1 minute. If a creature that doesn’t meet the
requirements passes through the archway, the trap activates.

**_Effect (Teleport)_**_._ The triggering creature is instantly
transported to another location within the dungeon or
structure containing the trap.

**_Countermeasures._** The archway has an aura of conjuration
magic when viewed with _detect magic_. A creature that
succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check can spot and
decipher a series of sigils or runes along the outside of the
archway or door, and understands the trap.

A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment with a successful
DC 10 spellcasting ability check; _dispel magic_ (DC 15) also
disables the trap.

_Hybrid trap (level 17-20, setback, hinder)_

A book of putrid secrets sits atop a plinth or pedestal, covered
in pulsing boils and pustules, waiting to be read. Above the
book, a hidden nozzle waits to disgorge a gout of vile slime
and sludge; a _rune of detection_ waits to activate the nozzle.

**_Trigger (Open/Close Object)_**_._ A creature that opens the book
triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Acid/Slime Blast)_**_._ A blast of putrid smelling slime
covers the triggering creature, who must make a DC 10
Dexterity saving throw. On a success, the creature avoids
the slime. On a failure, the creature must make a DC 11
Constitution saving throw or contract sewer plague from the
foul slime.

It takes 1d4 days for sewer plague’s symptoms to manifest in
an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps.
The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and
it regains only half the normal number of hit points from
spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.

Hybrid trap (level 17-20, setback, harm)
This 5-foot wide corridor is covered with a fine layer of dust,
concealing a rune of detection.
Trigger (Musical/Auditory). Any sound triggers the trap. A
creature that moves or performs actions in the trapped area
must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Stealth) check to avoid
triggering the trap.
Effect (Spikes). When activated, the rune activates a
mechanism that causes spikes to extend from the walls. Each
creature in the corridor must make a DC 10 Dexterity check,
taking 17 (5d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as
much on a successful one.
Countermeasures. With a successful DC 10 Wisdom
(Perception) check, a creature can find the hidden holes
for the spikes and the rune. The rune can also be found
with detect magic. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence
(Investigation) check, a creature can understand how the
trap operates.
A creature can disable the trap with a successful DC
10 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disrupt the rune, or a
successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to
disable the spikes. Dispel magic cast on the rune also disables
the trap, and silence can negate the trigger entirely.

Hybrid trap (level 17-20, setback, block)
Strange writing is scrawled on the wall, including a rune of
detection. The writing is spread over 5 feet, and there is a large
concealed hole in the wall beneath it.
Trigger (Produce Light/Darkness). Bringing a light source
within 5 feet of the writing triggers the trap.
Effect (Snare). A pair of steel jaws launches from the
concealed hole in the wall. The jaws make an attack roll
against the triggering creature with a +5 bonus to the roll,
dealing 16 (3d10) piercing damage on a hit. This attack
cannot gain advantage or disadvantage. A target hit by the
jaws is restrained until it is freed.
A successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity
check using thieves’ tools makes the jaws release. Failure
on either check deals 11 (2d10) piercing damage to the
trapped creature.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the rune; once found it can be dispelled with dispel
magic or with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

Magic trap (level 17-20, setback, hinder)
A gate with an offering bowl blocks the way to a treacherous,
labyrinthine path. To open the gate, a creature must place
an offering in the bowl representing something that
would distract it from a righteous course. If the offering is
accepted, the gate allows the creature passage. Any creature
who gives an unsatisfactory offering or attempts to sneak
through is magically blinded.
Trigger (Offering). A creature that places an unsatisfactory
offering in the bowl triggers the trap.
Effect (Blindness). A triggering creature must make a DC 10
Constitution saving throw or be magically blinded for 1 day.
The creature can make another DC 10 Constitution saving
throw at the end of every hour, ending the effect on a success.
A creature blinded by the trap can have their sight restored
with dispel magic (DC 17), remove curse or lesser restoration.
Countermeasures. Pictographs and carvings around the
gate provide clues to the nature of the trap; a creature that
succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check can deduce
the required offering.
The bowl has an aura of necromancy magic when viewed
with detect magic. A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment
on it with a successful DC 10 spellcasting ability check, or
with dispel magic.

A locked door bars farther passage. To the right of the door
is a small stone font engraved with a flame motif, filled with
water. At the bottom of the font is a key, and a hidden glyph of
warding (burning hands).
Trigger (Disturb Liquid). A creature that sticks their hand
into the water or otherwise disturbs the font triggers the
trap. Creatures can remove the key without causing ripples
by succeeding on a DC 10 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check.
Effect (Spell Effect). A thin sheet of blue flames shoots forth
from the font. Each creature in a 15-foot cone centered on
the triggering creature must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving
throw. A creature takes 17 (5d6) fire damage on a failed save,
or half as much damage on a successful one.
The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t
being worn or carried.
Countermeasures. The glyph can be found with a successful
DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check or with detect magic.
Once found, the glyph can be disabled with a successful DC
10 Intelligence (Arcana) check or with dispel magic.

A hidden trapdoor opens on to an 80-foot deep vertical
shaft. The trapdoor covers a 5-foot square space and has a
pressure plate embedded in it.
Trigger (Pressure Plate). A creature that steps on the
trapdoor activates the pressure plate, causing the trap door
to swing open.
Effect (Drop Into Empty Pit). The triggering creature must
make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a success, the creature
is able to grab onto the edge of the pit. On a failure, the creature
falls into the pit and takes 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage.
Countermeasures. With a successful DC 10 Wisdom

it can be disabled with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check

Magic trap (level 17-20, moderate, hinder)
There is a single book left on the shelf in this room. It has a
gilded spine covered with a spiralling, graceful motif; a glyph
of warding (blindness/deafness) is hidden in the book.
Trigger (Open/Close Book). Opening the tome triggers
the trap.
Effect (Spell Effect). When activated, the glyph casts
blindness/deafness as an 8th level spell. The glyph targets the
triggering creature and up to 7 other creatures, who all must
make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. If a creature fails,
they are blinded for 1 minute. At the end of each of their
turns, a blinded creature can make a DC 12 Constitution
saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 12
Intelligence (Arcana or History) check recognizes the book
as a rare or unique tome, one that might be trapped in some
way. Casting detect magic reveals an aura of abjuration magic
around the tome, and dispel magic disables the trap.

_Magic trap (level 17-20, moderate, harm)_

At the far end of this chamber is an anvil, glowing with a
throbbing, red heat. Stuck in the anvil is a rune-engraved
battleaxe. Lying around the anvil are 4 dwarf corpses in
various states of death and decay.

**_Trigger (Draw Weapon)._** Pulling the battleaxe from the anvil
triggers the trap. It can only be removed by a dwarf.

**_Effect (Reanimate Creatures)._** The 4 dead dwarves rise as
**wights** and attack all other creatures in the room, focusing
on the triggering creature. If the creature that pulled the
battleaxe from the anvil drops it or dies, the axe magically
reappears in the anvil. The wights fade into nothingness if
reduced to 0 hit points, or if dispelled with _dispel magic_ (DC
18). They do not leave the room and, if not killed, return to
dormancy after 24 hours.

**_Countermeasures._** With a successful DC 12 Intelligence
(History or Religion) check, a creature can identify the anvil
and understands the trap. A dwarf has advantage on this
check. If viewed with _detect magic_ , the anvil has an aura of
necromancy magic.

A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the anvil with a
successful DC 12 spellcasting ability check, or with _dispel magic_.

_Mechanical trap (level 17-20, setback, harm)_

A heavy door blocks the way forward; a spring-loaded arm is
attached to the ceiling on the other side. A long, sharp metal
rod is affixed perpendicular to the arm. The arm is set to
release when the door opens.

**_Trigger (Open Door)_**_._ A creature that opens the door triggers
the trap.

**_Effect (Swinging Object)_**_._ A large spike affixed to a spring-
loaded arm swings down and attacks the creature standing
in the doorway. The spike makes a melee attack roll against
the triggering creature with a +5 bonus, dealing 27 (5d10)
piercing damage if it hits. This attack cannot gain advantage
or disadvantage.

**_Countermeasures (Difficult)._** A creature that succeeds
on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check can spot some of
the mechanisms by opening the door a crack, but it takes
a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check to
understand the trap.

Once understood, a creature can disable the trap with a
successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.

Mechanical trap (level 17-20, moderate, harm)
Scrape marks line the walls of this chamber. A treasure chest
banded with iron rests in a slight depression in the center. A
hidden mechanism is worked into the base of the chest.
Trigger (Open/Close Chest). Opening the chest triggers
the trap.
Effect (Crushing Ceiling/Walls). When activated, the walls
of the room begin to move in towards the center, moving
at a rate of 1 foot per round at the end of the initiative
order. Once the surface reaches a creature’s space, they take
1d10 bludgeoning damage. If the surface is still moving
on the next turn, the creature is restrained and takes 2d10
bludgeoning damage. A third round spent being crushed
inflicts 4d10 bludgeoning damage, the fourth and every
round thereafter inflicts 10d10 bludgeoning damage until
the surface retracts. Once the walls meet in the middle of the
room, they retract.
Countermeasures (Difficult). A successful DC 12 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the hidden mechanism in the
chest. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check
reveals the nature of the trigger, and allows a creature to
attempt a DC 12 Dexterity check while using thieves’ tools to
disable the trap.

Magic trap (level 17-20, moderate, hinder)
A glowing pillar casts blindingly bright light throughout
this room. An altar is just barely visible on the other side
of the pillar.
Trigger (Step Into Light/Darkness). Blocking the light falling
upon the altar triggers the trap.
Effect (Petrification). Any creature within 30 feet of the altar
when there is no light falling on it must succeed on a DC 12
Constitution saving throw if their body is made of flesh.
On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to turn to
crystal. On a successful save, the creature isn’t affected.
A creature restrained by this effect must make another DC
12 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
If it successfully saves against this effect three times, it
ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to crystal
and subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and
failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until
the target collects three of a kind.
If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers
from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 12 Intelligence (Religion
or Arcana) check lets a creature recognize this crystal and
understand the trap. The crystal has an aura of transmutation
magic when viewed with detect magic. Casting dispel magic (DC
16) on the crystal disables the trap, and spells like daylight or
darkness can also provide ways to bypass the crystal.

Magic trap (level 17-20, moderate, harm)
A large clay statue stands blocking passage to an important
area; a word is written on its forehead in an obscure
language. If a creature approaches the statue and doesn’t
speak the password, the statue animates and attacks.
Trigger (Fail to Speak Password). A creature that gets within
20 feet of the statue and fails to speak the password within 1
round triggers the trap.
Effect (Release Creatures). The statue is a clay golem that
attacks the triggering creature and its companions. However,
its primary purpose is preventing creatures from getting to
the area it guards. The golem will not leave the room.
Once roused, the golem will remain active for 24 hours, or
until a creature says the password. If reduced to 0 hit points,
it crumbles to dust.
Countermeasures. The statue can be identified as a golem with
a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check. A creature that
speaks the obscure language written on the golem can deduce
the password; a successful DC 12 Intelligence (History) check
can also provide clues about the golem.

Mechanical trap (level 17-20, moderate, harm)
At the center of the chamber is a gold statue sitting on
a sturdy stone pedestal. A tension cable is affixed to the
bottom of the statue and runs down through a hole through
the center of the pedestal.
Trigger (Pick Up Object). A creature that picks up the statue
triggers the trap.
Effect (Drop Into Pit). The floor surrounding the pedestal
suddenly drops away, revealing a pit filled with acid. Each
creature standing next to the pedestal must succeed on a DC
12 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the pit. A creature that
starts its turn in the acid takes 7 (2d6) acid damage per round.
At your discretion, the acid can damage weapons, armor,
and other items. Any non-magical ammunition the creature
is carrying is destroyed, and any non-magical weapons
and armor the creature is carrying takes a permanent
and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls or AC for each
round of contact with the acid. If its penalty drops to -5, the
weapon or armor is destroyed.
Countermeasures (Difficult). A successful DC 12 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the trap door, and with a
successful DC 12 Intelligence (Investigation) check made
while examining the statue reveals the trigger. A DC 12
Dexterity check made with thieves' tools disables the trap.

_Magic trap (level 17-20, moderate, hinder)_

The walls and floors of this chamber are padded with
feather-filled cushions. Hanging from the ceiling on a chain
is a silver censer.

**_Trigger (Unconsciousness)._** If a creature falls unconscious in
the room the censer begins to emit magical smoke.

**_Effect (Aging)._** The smoke wraps around unconscious
creatures, who must on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw
or be magically aged/de-aged 1d10 years. If the roll is even,
creatures are made older; if the roll is odd, they are made
younger. This effect can be undone with _greater restoration_ , but
only if it is cast within 24 hours of being aged.

**_Countermeasures._** A creature that succeeds on a DC 12
Intelligence (Arcana or History) check recognizes the
censer and understands the trap. The censer has an aura of
necromancy magic if viewed with _detect magic_. A spellcaster
can disrupt the enchantment on the censer with a successful
DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check; _dispel magic_ (DC 18) cast on
the censer also disables the trap.

_Hybrid trap (level 17-20, moderate, harm)_

Outside the entrance to this pitch black room or hall is a
small shrine with unlit ceremonial candles, each with an
inscription that reads (possibly in a foreign language) “walk
safely in the light.” Anyone entering the room without one
of these lit candles is quickly plunged into a pit beneath the
floor. Darkvision does not penetrate the magical darkness
within the room.

**_Trigger (Produce Light/Darkness)_**_._ A creature standing in
the chamber for more than 1 round (6 seconds) without
holding one of the lit ceremonial candles triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Drop Into Spiked Pit)_**_._ The 5-foot area of floor directly
beneath the triggering creature falls way, revealing a 40-foot-
deep spiked pit. The triggering creature must succeed on a DC
12 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the pit and take 14 (4d6)
bludgeoning damage and 21 (6d6) piercing damage.

**_Countermeasures_**_._ The room and the candles have an aura
of evocation magic when viewed with _detect magic_. A creature
that succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check can deduce
the nature of the trap and knows to use the candles to grant
safe passage.

A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the room with

Magic trap (level 17-20, dangerous, subdue)
A glyph of warding ( forcecage) is hidden in this chamber, ready
to detect the presence of a particular item. Once that item is
brought into the chamber a cage of force traps the creature
carrying the item.
Trigger (Bring Item). A creature that brings the item into the
chamber triggers the trap.
Effect (Spell Effect). The glyph casts forcecage. An immobile,
invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force
springs into existence around the triggering creature. The
prison is a cage 20 feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch
diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart. It creates a solid barrier
that prevents any matter from passing through it and
blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.
Any creature that is completely inside the cage’s area is
trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or those
too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the
center of the area until they are completely outside the area.
A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by non-magical
means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or
interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a DC
15 Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature can use
that magic to exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can’t
exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage
also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
This spell can’t be dispelled by dispel magic ; it fades away after
1 hour.
Countermeasures. The glyph can be found with detect magic
or with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check.
Once discovered, the glyph can be disabled with a successful
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, or with dispel magic.

depicting mortals engaging in deals with devils, infernal
beings emerging from the hells, and angels being brought
low by devilish armies. A glyph of warding ( forcecage) is hidden
in the design of one of the tapestries.
Trigger (Corpse). If an evil creature dies in the area, or the
corpse of an evil creature enters the area, the trap is triggered.
Effect (Spell Effect). The glyph casts forcecage. An immobile,
invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force
springs into existence around the triggering creature. The
prison is a box 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier that
prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking
any spells cast into or out from the area.
Any creature that is completely inside the cage’s area is

_Magic trap (level 17-20, dangerous, harm)_

Resting atop a stand made of twisted iron is a vicious-
looking sword forged from adamantine. It seems to hum
with power.

**_Trigger (Spill Blood)._** A creature removing the sword from
the stand must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or
take 1 point of slashing damage as they nick themselves on
the blade. Spilling blood with the sword in this way triggers
the trap.

**_Effect (Summon Creatures)._** The spilled blood becomes the
red, pinpoint eyes of **3 wraiths**. The wraiths attack all other
creatures in the room, focusing on the triggering creature or
whoever is holding the sword. They do not leave the room.

The wraiths fade into nothingness if reduced to 0 hit points.
They fade back into the walls of the room if the sword is
replaced on the stand or after 24 hours.

At your discretion, the sword can be a magic item, or just an
adamantine weapon.

**_Countermeasures._** With a successful DC 15 Intelligence
(Arcana or History) check, a creature can recognize the
sword and knows about the dangers of the trap. With _detect
magic_ , the stand for the sword has an aura of necromancy
magic (if the sword is a magic item, it also has an aura).

A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the stand with
a successful DC 15 spellcasting ability check; _dispel magic_ cast
on the stand also disables the trap.

_Magic trap (level 17-20, dangerous, hinder)_

The floor of this chamber has a beautiful mosaic of a frog,
with a _glyph of warding (true polymorph)_ hidden in the design.

**_Trigger (Creature Detector)._** A character that walks across
the mosaic triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Spell Effect)._** The glyph casts _polymorph_ on the
triggering creature, which must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom
saving throw or be transformed into a **frog**. The spell has no
effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.

The transformation lasts for 1 hour, or until the target drops
to 0 hit points or dies. The target’s game statistics, including
mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of a frog.
It retains its alignment and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of a frog. When it reverts
to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit
points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of
dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to
its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce
the creature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked
unconscious.

Mechanical trap (level 17-20, dangerous)
A rather average lock seals a door or container and hides a
devious parting gift. A tiny sealed vial containing a strong
adhesive is hidden within the lock, and breaks open when
the lock is picked.
Trigger (Pick Lock). The lock can be picked with a successful
DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. However, a
creature that succeeds at picking the lock triggers the trap.
Effect (Acid/Slime Blast). The triggering creature must
succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have their hands
covered in sticky adhesive. While covered in adhesive, the
creature automatically fails any ability checks using Dexterity.
The adhesive can be washed off with 10 minutes of vigorous
scrubbing with soap and water, or with a 1 minute soak in a
gallon of alcohol.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 15

1 hour in this room must make a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion.
Trigger (Mortal Sacrifice). If a creature is killed by any
means other than fire damage, the trap is triggered.
Effect (Spell Effect). The glyph casts forcecage ; an immobile,
invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force
springs into existence around the triggering creature. The
prison is a solid box, 10 feet on a side, creating a solid barrier
that prevents any matter from passing through it and
blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.

Mechanical trap (level 17-20, dangerous, harm)
This 5-foot-wide corridor has a lever at the entrance; a
closed gate or door lies at the other end. When the lever is
pulled, the barrier opens and the walls begin contracting.
Once the walls meet, the door closes and the lever and wall
return to their original positions.
Trigger (Pull Lever). A creature that pulls the lever to open
the barrier triggers the trap.
Effect (Crushing Ceiling/Walls). The barrier opens and the
walls of the corridor begin contracting at a rate of 1 foot at the
end of each round. Once the surface reaches a creature’s space,
they take 1d10 bludgeoning damage. If the surface is still
moving on the next turn, the creature is restrained and takes
2d10 bludgeoning damage. A third round spent being crushed
inflicts 4d10 bludgeoning damage. On the fourth round, the
barriers meet in the middle of the corridor and retract.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals scrape marks on the floor, indicative of the
crushing walls. When examining the lever, a creature that
succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check spots
how the hidden mechanisms work and understands the
trap. Once understood, a creature that succeeds on a DC 15

Magic trap (level 17-20, dangerous)
A beautifully crafted seal is inlayed into a 5-foot-by-5-foot
section of the floor. The seal was originally intended to have
some arcane or religious significance, but now it has been
perverted by a glyph of warding (fireball).
Trigger (Cast Spell). A creature that casts a spell while
standing on the seal triggers the trap.
Effect (Spell Effect). The glyph casts fireball as a 9th level spell.
A bright streak flashes from the glyph to a point next to the
triggering creature and then blossoms with a low roar into
an explosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius
sphere centered on that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw. A target takes 49 (14d6) fire damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects
in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.
Countermeasures. The glyph can be found with a successful
DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, or with detect magic.
Once discovered, the glyph can be disrupted with a successful
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check, or with dispel magic.
A creature that succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana or

A creature restrained by this spell must make another DC 17
Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If
it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell
ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone
and subjected to the petrified condition. The successes and
failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until
the target collects three of a kind.
If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers
from similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.
The creature can be restored with greater restoration or more
powerful magic.
Countermeasures. The glyph can be found with detect magic
or with a DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Once

Magic trap (level 17-20, perilous)
A humanoid corpse lies on the floor, clutching an important
or valuable item in its dead hands. Retrieving the item will
most certainly disturb the body, triggering the trap.
Trigger (Corpse). A creature that disturbs the corpse triggers
the trap.
Effect (Summon Creature). The corpse suddenly writhes and
convulses, transforming into a nalfeshnee (or some other
creature of CR 13 or below that is more appropriate to the area)
and attacking all creatures in the area. The demon vanishes in a
puff of brimstone if reduced to 0 hit points. It will not leave the
area, and it becomes a humanoid corpse again after 24 hours.
Countermeasures. With a successful DC 17 Dexterity (Sleight
of Hand) check, a creature can retrieve the item without
triggering the trap.
When viewed with detect magic the corpse has an aura of
conjuration magic. With a successful DC 17 Intelligence
(Arcana) check, a creature can spot claw marks and traces
of hellfire around the corpse, indicative of its demonic
transformation.
A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the corpse

A creature inside the cage can’t leave it by non-magical
means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar
travel to leave the cage, it must first make a DC 15 Charisma

exit the cage. On a failure, the creature can’t exit the cage and
wastes the use of the spell or effect. The cage also extends into
the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

The wall can’t be dispelled by _dispel magic_ and it lasts for 1 hour.

triggering creature with a +10 bonus, dealing 88 (16d10)
piercing damage and 22 (4d10) fire damage on a hit. This
attack cannot gain advantage or disadvantage.
Countermeasures (Difficult). A successful DC 17 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the hidden mechanism on the door.
A successful DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals the
nature of the trigger, and allows a creature to disable the trap
with a successful DC 17 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.

_Magic trap (17-20, perilous, hinder)_

The chamber is filled with musical instruments such as
lutes, flutes, and drums resting in various stands or holders.
All the instruments appear at least slightly used. On the far
side of the chamber is a door with a frame of wood bearing
carvings of clouds and wind.

**_Trigger (Musical/Auditory)._** A creature that walks through
the door doesn’t need to be playing the instrument, but if
no woodwind is being played in the room when a creature
walks through the carved door the trap triggers.

**_Effect (Acid/Slime Blast)._** An eruption of terrible smelling
slime sprays from the door onto the triggering creature. The
target must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw
or become poisoned for 10 minutes. While poisoned in this
way, the target must repeat the saving throw at the start of
each of its turns. On a failure, the target is incapacitated for
1 round as it gags and retches. Dousing the creature with a
gallon of oil or alcohol removes the slime.

**_Countermeasures._** A successful DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana
or Performance) check allows a creature to interpret the
meaning of the carvings on the wall and understand the
trap. When viewed with _detect magic_ , the door has an aura of
abjuration magic.

A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment with a successful
DC 17 spellcasting ability check; _dispel magic_ (DC 17) also
disables the trap.

_Magic trap (level 17-20, perilous)_

The air in this area is thick with static electricity and the
smell of ozone, like the approach of a thunderstorm. This is
all indicative of a place infused with wild magic.

**_Trigger (Cast Spell)_**_._ A creature that casts a spell in the area
triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Wild Magic)_**_._ The triggering creature is hit with a surge
of magical feedback. Roll 1d6 + 2 times on the table below.

```
d10 Effect
```
```
1 Heavy rain falls in a 60-foot radius centered on a
target creature. The area becomes lightly obscured.
The rain follows the creature until they are out of
the trap’s range.
```
```
2 An animal appears in the unoccupied space nearest
the target. The animal acts as it normally would. Roll
a d100 to determine which animal appears. On a 01-
25, a rhinoceros appears; on a 26-50, an elephant
appears; and on a 51-100, a rat appears.
```
```
d10 Effect
```
```
3 A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a 30-foot
radius centered on the target. The area becomes
heavily obscured. The butterflies follows the
creature until they are out of the trap’s range.
4 Grass grows on the ground in a 60-foot radius
centered on the target. If grass is already there,
it grows to ten times its normal size and remains
overgrown for 1 minute.
```
```
5 An object of the DM 's choice disappears into the
Ethereal Plane. The object must be neither wrong
nor carried, within range of the trap, and no larger
than 10 feet in any dimension.
6 Leaves grow from the target. Unless they are picked
off, the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24 hours.
```
```
7 The trap attacks the target with a large gem worth
1d4 x 10 gp.
8 A burst of colorful shimmering light extends from
the target in a 30-foot radius. The target and each
creature in the area that can see must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw or become blinded for
1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.
```
```
9 The target's skin turns bright blue for 1d10 days.
10 The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, and
its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This
reduction decreases its size by one category—from
Medium to Small, for example. The target also has
disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength
saving throws and its weapons also shrink to match
its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the
target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this
can’t reduce the damage below 1). This effect ends if
dispelled with dispel magic (3rd level spell) or remove
curse , or after 1 minute.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 17
Intelligence (Arcana) check understands the nature of the
trap. Detect magic or a similar effect can also reveal the trap,
but might set it off as well.

Mechanical trap (level 17-20, deadly, harm)
A 1-foot thick ring of decorative stonework surrounds a
25-foot diameter circle area in the center of the room. The
ceiling directly above the ring is blackened with soot. In the
5-foot square at the circle’s center is something intriguing.
Trigger (Weight Sensitive Floor). When a Small or larger
creature steps onto a space adjacent to the 5-foot square
at the center of the area within the ring, they activate a
pressure plate. Parts of the stonework slide away, revealing
spouts which pour flaming oil onto the floor from the ring’s
inner edge.
Effect (Wall of Fire). The flaming oil creates a ringed wall of
flames 25 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The
wall is opaque and lasts for 1 minute. When the wall appears,
each creature within its area must make a DC 20 Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 (25d6) fire
damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.
The side of the wall facing inwards deals the trap’s fire
damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of
that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same damage
when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its
turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.
A creature that is adjacent to the wall that succeeds on a DC
20 Constitution check using thieves’ tools ends this effect.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the pressure plate, and a successful DC 20
Dexterity check while using thieves’ tools disables it.

Hybrid trap (level 17-20, deadly)
An altar is adorned with fascinating relics, including a
jeweled skull rests under a dome of glass. The cover is
enchanted to contain the skull’s curse.
Trigger (Pick Up/Shift Object). A creature that removes the
glass dome that covers the skull triggers the trap.
Effect (Exhaustion). All living creatures within 60 feet of
the jeweled skull must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution
saving throw at the beginning of their turns or gain 1 level of
exhaustion. The skull has no effect on constructs or undead.
Covering the skull with the dome ends this effect.
Countermeasures. With a successful DC 20 Intelligence
(History or Religion) check, a creature recognizes the skull
and understands the danger it poses. When viewed with
detect magic , the glass dome has an aura of abjuration magic,
while the skull has an aura of necromancy magic.
A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment with a successful
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check; dispel magic (DC 20) also
disables the trap.

Mechanical trap (level 17-20, perilous,subdue)
After triggering a tripwire in the corridor, 2-foot-diameter
horizontal logs roll out of the ceiling. Channels in the walls
guide the logs as they slam down in front and behind the
area around the tripwire, trapping those near the tripwire
between two floor-to-ceiling log walls.
Trigger (Tripwire). A creature that walks through the
tripwire triggers the trap.
Effect (Cage). Thick timbers hidden in the ceiling of the
corridor drop into channels in the walls in front of and
behind the tripwire, creating a 20-foot-long-by-10-foot-
wide wooden cage within the corridor. A creature in the path
of the falling logs must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw,
taking 70 (20d6) bludgeoning damage, or half as much on a
success. Each log has an AC of 5, 50 HP, immunity to piercing
damage, and vulnerability to fire damage.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception)
check the channels in the walls that the logs fall into. The
tripwire can be found with a successful DC 15 Intelligence
(Investigation) check, and disabled with a successful DC 20
Dexterity check using thieves' tools.

Level 17-20 Deadly
These traps will almost certainly kill characters of these levels.

Magic trap (level 17-20, deadly, alarm)
A 1-foot thick ring of decorated stonework surrounds a 25-
foot diameter circle area in the center of the room. The ceiling
directly above the ring has a glyph of warding (dispel magic).
Trigger (Cast Spell). Casting a spell within the ring of
stonework triggers the trap.
Effect (Dispel Magic). The glyph casts dispel magic as a 9th-
level spell, targeting the triggering creature. Any spell of 9th
level or lower on the creature ends. The glyph also releases
an audible chime that rings out through the area, audible up
to 60 feet away
Countermeasures. A successful DC 20 Intelligence
(Investigation) check reveals the glyph. Once found, it can be
dispelled with dispel magic , or disabled with a successful DC
20 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

Hybrid trap (level 17-20, deadly, harm)
The passageway ends at a small area with an old well, water
steadily dripping into it from above. The well is overflowing;
excess water is running onto the floor and into puddles
down the passageway. A tripwire is strung across the puddle
farthest from the well.
Trigger (Tripwire). A creature that breaks the tripwire alerts
the lurking elementals.
Effect (Release Creatures). The well is home to 2 water
elementals who erupt from the well and attack all other
creatures. If reduced to 0 hit points, the elementals collapse
into small puddles. They will not leave the area and return to
dormancy after 24 hours.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana
or Nature) check or Wisdom (Survival) check reveals clues
that the water coming from the well is behaving strangely,
indicative of an elemental.

Hybrid trap (level 17-20, deadly, harm)
A magnificent marble archway stands in the center of this
otherwise empty room. Looking through the archway reveals
a forest that cannot otherwise be seen beyond it. A rune of
detection is worked into the design on the keystone of the arch.
Trigger (Pass Threshold). Passing through the archway
triggers the trap.
Effect (Swinging Object). When activated, the rune releases a
greatsword of sharpness that slashes at the triggering creature.
The sword makes a melee attack with a +12 bonus, dealing 100
(20d6 + 30) magic slashing damage if it hits. If the sword rolls
a 20 on the attack roll, the triggering creature takes an extra
14 (4d6) slashing damage. The sword then rolls another d20. If
it rolls a 20, it lops off one of the target’s limbs, with the effect
of such loss determined by the GM. If the creature has no limb
to sever, the sword lops off a portion of its body instead.
Countermeasures. The rune can be found with a successful
DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check or with detect magic. Once
found, it can be disabled with a successful DC 20 Intelligence
(Arcana) check; dispel magic also disables the trap.

_Mechanical trap (level 17-20, deadly, block)_

As well as the more conventional exits from this room, a
section of one of the wood-panelled walls appears to be
made of plaster rather than bricks.

**_Trigger (Break Object)._** Breaking the fake wall triggers
the trap.

**_Effect (Cage)._** Bars shoot up from the floor around the
broken section of wall in a 10-foot ring, creating a floor-to-
ceiling cage. Any creatures caught in the area when the trap
is triggered must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw
or become trapped in the cage.

The bars are made of adamantine and enchanted and slowly
begin to cool down to a freezing temperature. Any creature
that starts their turn within 5 feet of the cage takes 11 (2d10)
cold damage. This damage increases by 2d10 each round.

Breaking the cage requires a successful DC 20 Strength
check. With a successful DC 20 Dexterity check, a creature
can make the bars retract.

**_Countermeasures (Difficult)._** A successful DC 20 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the hidden mechanisms in the
fake wall and floor. A creature that succeeds on a DC 20
Intelligence check with mason’s tools can also spot the
falseness of the wall.

Once discovered, a successful DC 20 Intelligence
(Investigation) check reveals the nature of the trigger, and
allows a creature to disable the trap with a successful DC 20
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.

L R

_Mechanical trap (level 17-20, deadly, harm)_

A 50-foot-deep, 15-foot-wide chasm lies ahead. A pressure
plate at the edge of the chasm activates a swinging log
designed to knock any creatures in its path into the chasm.
However, clever creatures may use the swinging log to cross.

**_Trigger (Pressure Plate)_**_._ A creature that steps on the
pressure plate triggers the trap.

**_Effect (Swinging Object)_**_._ A massive log attached to the
ceiling swings toward the edge of the chasm. All creatures
within 15 feet of the edge of the chasm must make a DC
20 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails takes 70
(20d6) bludgeoning damage and falls into the chasm, taking
an additional 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage. On a success,
a creature takes 35 (10d6) bludgeoning damage and is
launched to the other side of the chasm.

**_Countermeasures (Sensitive)_**_._ A successful DC 20 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the pressure plate and a successful
DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the log. The trap
can be disabled with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using
thieves' tools, but a result of 10 or lower triggers the trap.

Magic trap (level 17-20, deadly, harm)
Within this large chamber is a massive stone statue of a
dragon. A sealed door blocks the way forward, and various
passages of music are written on the walls of the chamber.
Playing the correct musical notes opens the door; playing
the wrong notes awakens the dragon.
Trigger (Auditory/Musical). A creature can make a DC 20
Charisma (Performance) check to identify the various bits of
music on the wall and play one. On a success, the door opens;
a failure triggers the trap.
Effect (Release Creatures). The statue animates, becoming a
young black dragon that attacks all other creatures in the
area. If reduced to 0 hit points, the dragon crumbles to dust. It
will not leave the area, and after 24 hours it returns to stone.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on successful DC
20 Intelligence (History or Performance) check knows about
the dragon statue and understands the trap. The statue has
an aura of abjuration magic when viewed with detect magic.
A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the statue with
a successful DC 20 spellcasting ability check; dispel magic (DC
19) also disables the trap.

A formidable spiral staircase is strewn with bones and
scraps of armor. Written in blood on the bottom step is a
passage from a demonic text, written in Infernal.
Trigger (Creature Detector). Any non-undead that uses the
stairs triggers the trap.
Effect (Teleport). The triggering creature must succeed on a
DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be teleported somewhere
else in the dungeon or area, usually a prison of some kind.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 20
Intelligence (Religion) check recognizes the text and
understands the nature of the trap. When viewed with detect
magic , the stairs have an aura of conjuration magic.
A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the stairs with
a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check; dispel magic
(DC 19) also disables the trap.

Effect (Drop Into Monster Lair). The floor below the portrait
swings open, revealing a 10-foot wide hole and a drop of 20
feet. A creature standing above the trapdoor must succeed
on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or fall, taking 70 (20d6)
bludgeoning damage.
At the bottom of the pit is a 30-foot square chamber. Inside
it is a stone golem , carved to resemble a minotaur skeleton.

Chapter Seven | Complex Traps 87

COMPLEX TRAPS

A complex trap has multiple triggers, or a trigger with multiple
inputs (such as levers or buttons), and multiple effects, or an
effect with stages. Most of the time, complex traps do reset
once they have gone through all their effects or stages.

Like a simple trap, a complex trap is meant to harm, hinder,
or impose some negative situation on it’s targets. However, a
simple trap usually has only one trigger and one effect and, in
general, simple traps don’t reset once they are triggered.

Complex traps and puzzles can often be mistaken for each
other. Both tend to have moving parts (metaphorically or
literally), both can be mentally trying, and both can have
similar components. The main difference is the purpose of
the obstacle. In many cases, a complex trap challenges the
_character_ , while a puzzle challenges the _player_.

**_Minor Adjustments_**_._ If you’re fond of a trap in this chapter,
you can always adjust it to provide the right level of
challenge for the characters in your campaign. Chapter 9:
Designing Traps has tables for things like ability check DC’s,
damage, and other variables for a trap based. Find what best
suits your needs and use that instead of the statistics given
in this chapter.

```
R  C T
A complex trap is a dynamic threat, with more elements
than a simple trap. However, a complex trap’s type, level
range, lethality, purpose, trigger, and countermeasures all
work the same as they do for simple traps.
Initiative. A complex trap takes turns like a creature,
and this part of the description tells you when the trap
acts during the round. A complex trap always acts after a
creature that has the same initiative count.
Active Elements. When a trap acts, it produces specific
effects as detailed here.
Dynamic Elements. Some complex traps have threats that
increase in severity over time. Usually, these elements
happen at the end of the trap’s turns or in response to a
creature’s actions.
Constant Elements. A complex trap can damage or affect
creatures even when not taking its turn. These elements
usually happen to creatures that end their turn in certain areas.
```

88 Chapter Seven | Complex Traps

```
Initiative. The trap acts on initiative 20 and 10.
Active Elements. The Stair Slide is primarily a ramp
depositing creatures in the pit at its bottom, but also has
bolts that fire at creatures along the 120 feet from the trigger
area to the trapdoor.
```
**- Stairs to Slide (Initiative 20).** This element activates
    only once, the first time the trap acts. The stairs fold
    down, turning into a slide that is difficult terrain. Each
    creature on any portion of the stairs must succeed on a
    DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
**- Open the Pit (Initiative 20).** This element activates
    only once, the first time the trap acts. A trap door at the
    bottom landing of the stairs opens, revealing a 10-foot
    deep pit.
**- Hidden Bolts (Initiative 10).** Bolts fire out from holes in
    the walls in the 120 feet between the trigger area and the
    trapdoor, making one attack against each creature in the
    area: +5 attack bonus; 2 (1d4) piercing damage on a hit.
**_Dynamic Elements._** A creature that starts its turn on the
slide moves 30 feet down it, towards the pit. The distance
the creature moves increases by 30 feet each time it starts its
turn on the slide.
**_Constant Elements._** Creatures are subjected to a shower of
crossbow bolts while on the slide and drop into the pit when
they hit the bottom.
**- Hail of Bolts.** Any creature that ends its turn in the
Hidden Bolts’ area is targeted by a ranged attack: +5
attack bonus; taking 2 (1d4) piercing damage on a hit.
**- Into the Pit.** A creature that reaches the bottom of the
slide while prone or moving faster than their base speed
must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall
into the pit, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage and
landing prone.
**_Countermeasures._** Creatures can avoid activating the Stair
Slide and deal with these elements in a number of ways.
**Trigger.** A creature can spot the weight sensitive stairs that
trigger the trap with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)
check. Once found, the trigger can be disabled with a
successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.
**Stairs to Slide.** A creature can try to make the slide revert
back to stairs with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using
thieves’ tools.
**Open the Pit.** A creature can climb out of the pit with a
successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. The trap doors can
be closed with a successful DC 10 Strength check; the doors
lock together. A creature that fails this check falls into the pit.
**Hidden Bolts.** Creatures who succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom
(Perception) check find the holes in a 5-foot section of wall
from which the bolts fire. They can then plug these holes
with cloth or something similar as an action. Plugging the
holes prevents the bolts from firing in that area.

Chapter Seven | Complex Traps 89

W B

_Mechanical trap (level 1-4, moderate, harm)_

The 10-foot wide corridor has flagstones along it, one of
which is a pressure plate. When a creature steps on the plate,
a curved blade pops out from the wall and slices targets
within range. It continues to slash out, blocking the corridor.

**_Trigger_**. A Small or larger creature stepping on the pressure
plate triggers the trap

**_Initiative_**_._ The trap acts on initiative 20.

**_Active Elements_**_._ A scything blade emerges from a hidden
panel in the wall and attacks.

**Scything Blade (Initiative 20)**. Creatures in a 10-foot line
in front of the blade must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 2 (1d4) slashing damage on a failed save, or
half as much on a successful one.

**_Dynamic Elements_**_._ The blade becomes more dangerous the
longer the trap remains active.

**Blade Accelerates**. The blade moves with increasing speed.
Each time the trap acts, Scything Blade’s damage increases
by 2 (1d4) to a maximum of 10 (4d4).

**_Constant Elements_**. The Scything Blade slashes creatures in
front of it.

**Scything Blade**. Any creature that ends its turn in a 10-foot
line in front of the blade must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving
throw, taking the blade’s current damage, or half as much on
a success.

**_Countermeasures_**. The trap’s trigger and active element can
be thwarted by particular countermeasures.

**Pressure Plate (Sensitive).** A successful DC 12 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the pressure plate, and a
successful DC 12 Dexterity check while using thieves’ tools
disables it, preventing the trap from activating. However, if
the Dexterity check totals 5 or less the trap activates.

**Scything Blade.** Characters can smash the blade, damage
its components, or discern how to avoid it.

_Intelligence (Investigation), DC 12._ As an action, a creature that
can see the blade can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation)
check. A successful check means that the creature has
learned how to anticipate the blade’s movement, giving
them advantage on the next Dexterity saving throw
made by the creature to avoid the blade while they aren’t
incapacitated.

_Attack._ A creature in the area can ready an attack to strike at
the blade as it passes by. The creature has disadvantage on
its next Dexterity saving throw made to avoid the blade. The
creature then attacks. The blade has AC 15, 15 hit points, and
immunity to poison and psychic damage.

_Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, DC 12._ Creatures can use
thieves’ tools in the blade’s area to foil its mechanism. A
successful check stops the blade from activating.

A S D
Mechanical trap (level 1-4, dangerous, harm)
A section of floor contains a locked trap door, sensitive to
tapping, prodding, or investigating If triggered, the doors
open and a grasping vine that snares the triggering creature.
The snare pulls the creature through the trap doors and into
a nest of stirges.
Trigger (Tap/Prod). Applying pressure to the locked trap
door via tapping or prodding triggers the trap. Creatures can
investigate the trapdoor without activating the trigger by
succeeding at a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check
Initiative. The trap acts on initiative 20.
Active Elements. A Short Drag consists of a trapdoor that
swings open, a snare that drags the triggering creature down
a slope into a chamber, and a nest of 4 stirges.
Trap Door Opens (Initiative 20). This element activates only
once, the first time the trap acts.The trap door unlocks and
swings open, locking into place. A creature standing on the
trap door must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or
slide down a 30-foot long ramp, taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning
damage and landing prone in the chamber beneath.
Grasping Vine (Initiative 20). A vine whips out from the
trap door toward the triggering creature. It must succeed on
a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (1d6) bludgeoning
damage and be restrained until it is freed.
Dynamic Elements. A creature that ends its turn while
restrained by the vine is pulled 30 feet down a slope into the
chamber with the stirges. The vine then releases them.
Constant Elements. The chamber is home to 4 stirges who
attack creatures dragged in by the vine. The stirges do not
leave the chamber on their own.
Countermeasures. The trap’s trigger and the snare can be
thwarted by particular countermeasures.
Trigger. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check
reveals the sensitivity of the trapdoor; it can be disabled
with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.
A success on this check also unlocks the trapdoor
Grasping Vine. A successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check
allows a creature snared by the vine to escape. The snare can
also be cut; it has AC 15, 15 hit points, immunity to poison and
psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire damage.

Hybrid trap (level 1-4, perilous, harm)
This 200-foot long, sloping corridor is filled with crushed
skeletons and has a locked door at its lowest end. Above the
door, spelled out in a mosaic, is a simple riddle. Answering
the riddle makes the skeletons reanimate; a giant skull then
falls from the ceiling and starts to roll toward the door.
Trigger. Uttering the answer to the riddle while in the
corridor triggers the trap.
Initiative. The trap acts on initiative 20 and 10.
Active Elements. Hauntedwood Bowl reanimates the
skeletons, then drops a giant skull into the corridor which
rolls toward the bottom.
Reanimate Creatures (Initiative 20). 3 skeletons animate
and attack living creatures in the corridor. The trap cannot
animate more than 12 skeletons at a time. If it would
animate more than 12, the oldest 3 crumble to dust.
Rolling Skull (Initiative 10). The first time this element
activates, a massive skull drops from a trap door in the
ceiling and starts to roll down the corridor at a speed of 50
feet a round. On subsequent activations, the skull moves
another 50 feet down the corridor.
Skeletons (Initiative 10). The animated skeletons move and
attack living creatures in the corridor.
Constant Elements. The massive skull barreling down the
corridor threatens to crush everything in its path.
Giant Skull. Each creature in the skull’s path must make
a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature
takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone.
On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and
isn’t knocked prone. Objects that block the skull, such as a
conjured wall, take maximum damage from the impact.
Countermeasures. The trap’s trigger and active elements can
be thwarted by particular countermeasures.
Trigger. A creature that succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence
(Investigation) check or DC 17 Wisdom (Insight) check
can deduce or intuit the trigger word. A successful DC
17 Wisdom (Perception) check lets a creature notice the
hidden trapdoor in the ceiling. The corridor has an aura of
necromancy magic when viewed with detect magic ; the mosaic
has an rune of detection hidden in its design.
Reanimate Creatures. The door at the end of the corridor
can be opened with a successful DC 17 Strength check, or a
successful DC 17 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. Once
the door is open, the trap stops animating skeletons.
Rolling Skull. If the skull hits a barrier without destroying
it, it stops. Once the skull hits the door at the lowest end of
the corridor it smashes into smithereens. If it rolls out of the
corridor, it crumbles to dust.

Complex trap (level 1-4, deadly, harm)
Hidden in the floor is a trapdoor that drops creatures into a
pit that quickly becomes a watery grave.
Trigger. When two or more Medium sized creatures stand
on the trapdoor the trap triggers.
Initiative. The trap acts on Initiative 20 and 10.
Active Elements. The Drenching Pit consists of a locked
trapdoor and a pit that slowly fills with water.
Trapdoor (Initiative 20). This element activates only once,
when the trap first acts. A 10-foot by 10-foot trapdoor is
set into the floor and held closed by a heavy spring. Once
triggered, the trapdoor opens and drops creatures into the
pit below. The door then lifts back into place and rods slide
into it, bolting the door in place.
The pit beneath the door is 20 feet deep. A creature standing
on it when the trap triggers must make a DC 20 Dexterity
saving throw. On a success, the creature is able to grab onto
the edge of the pit. Otherwise, the creature falls into the pit
and takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage.
Flooding Water (Initiative 10). Water fills the pit at a rate
of 5 feet per round.
Constant Elements. The pit slowly fills with water, making
attempts to escape more difficult.
Treading Water. After 2 rounds, the water is at chest height
for Small creatures, and any ability checks made to disable
the trap have disadvantage. Attack rolls to break the spouts
or trapdoor are unaffected.
After 3 rounds, creatures start to tread water. A creature
treading water can keep it’s head clear for a number of
minutes equal to 1+its Constitution score. After that time,
the creature starts must hold their breath or drown.
After 4 rounds, the water in the pit is deep enough that
ability checks made to disable the trap have disadvantage.
An attack roll made by a creature that doesn’t have a
swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic)
has disadvantage unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin,
shortsword, spear, or trident.
Countermeasures. Creatures can deal with the trap’s
elements in multiple ways.
Trapdoor. The trapdoor can be found before it opens. Once
it shuts, it can be attacked or unlocked.
Detect. A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals
the trapdoor and a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using
thieves’ tools disables the trap.
Attack. A creature can attack the trapdoor, hopefully breaking
it open before their companions drown. The trapdoor has an
AC of 15, 50 (5d10) hit points, immunity to piercing, poison,
and psychic damage, and vulnerability to fire damage.
Unlock. The trapdoor can be unlocked with a successful DC 20
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.
```

Chapter Seven | Complex Traps 91

**Spouts**. Water flows into the pit from 4 spouts. Once all 4
have been closed in some way, water ceases filling the pit.

_Attack_. If a creature is adjacent to a spout, they can destroy it
with a melee attack. The spouts all have an AC of 19, 5 (2d4)
hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and
vulnerability to bludgeoning damage.

_Plug._ If a creature can reach a spout, they can wedge an object
or some cloth into it. Any spell that deals cold damage can
freeze a spout closed.

_Hybrid trap (level 5-8, setback, harm)_

This low-ceilinged chamber is warded by a magical charm
that triggers a trap when creatures talk inside. When
triggered, creatures within the chamber are blinded by a
flash of light from a lantern in the middle of the ceiling,
while spears stab down repeatedly.

**_Trigger_**. Talking in this chamber triggers the trap.

**_Initiative_**_._ The trap acts on Initiative 20 and 10.

**_Active Elements_**_._ Stab in the Dark attempts to magically blind
the creatures within and stab them with repeating spears.

**Blindness (Initiative 20)**. All creatures within the chamber
must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or
become blinded. A blinded creature can repeat the saving
throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on
a success. A creature who succeeds on the saving throw is
immune to the magical blindness for 1 minute.

**Spears (Initiative 10).** Spears stab down from hidden holes in
the ceiling of the chamber. Each creature in the chamber must
make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3 (1d6) piercing
damage on a failure, or half damage as much on a success.

**_Constant Elements_**. The Stabbing Spears affect each creature
that ends its turn in the chamber.

**Spears**. Any creature that ends its turn in the chamber must
make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3 (1d6) piercing
damage on a failure, or half damage as much on a success.

**_Countermeasures_**. The trigger and Active Elements of the
trap can be thwarted by particular countermeasures.

**Trigger**. The lantern on the room’s ceiling has an aura of
abjuration and necromancy magic when viewed with _detect
magic_. A creature that succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence
(Investigation) check while examining the lantern can
find some strange sigils on it, and with a successful DC 10
Intelligence (Arcana) check they understand the trap.

A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the lamp with
_dispel magic_ or with a successful DC 10 spellcasting ability check.

**Spears.** The easiest way to avoid the spears is to drop
prone, as they are not long enough to reach the floor of the
chamber. Alternatively, a character can ready an action
to snap the spears when they stab down. The creature
makes its Dexterity saving throw against the spears with
disadvantage. After they have taken damage, they can snap
the spear with a successful DC 10 Strength check. This makes
one 5-foot square of the room safe from the Spears element.

T H
Hybrid trap (level 5-8, moderate, hinder)
This trap is set in a conical chamber; an inverted cone filled
with sand is hidden by a sliding plate in the ceiling. The plate
has a skull-like sigil inscribed on it. If a creature spills blood
in the chamber, the sliding plate withdraws, connecting
the two chambers and allowing sand to pour into the lower
chamber. The doors lock shut, preventing escape, and the
sand is cursed to age any creature buried within it.
Trigger. The spilling of blood within the chamber triggers
the trap.
Initiative. The trap acts on Initiative 20 and 10.
Active Elements. The Hourglass locks the doors and cursed
sand begins to pour into the chamber.
Locked Doors (Initiative 20). This effect activates only
once, the first time the trap acts. The exits and entrances to
this room slam together and lock shut.
Falling Sand (Initiative 10). A sliding plate in the ceiling
withdraws and sand begins to pour into the room through a
5-foot wide hole. Creatures in the area must make successful
Dexterity saving throws at the beginning of their turns to
stay atop the sand. The DC starts at 12 and increases by 2 at
the end of each round.
A creature that fails one saving throw is buried up to their
knees and restrained. On their next saving throw, if the
creature succeeds they dig themselves out and are no longer
restrained; if they fail they are buried waist-deep and
remain restrained.
A creature buried waist-deep must make a Strength saving
throw at the beginning of their turn, using the current save
DC of the trap. If they succeed they dig themselves free
of the sand and if they fail they are buried to the neck and
immobilized. On their next turn, the creature is completely
buried and starts suffocating.
As an action, a creature can dig out another creature with
a successful Strength (Athletics) check against the current
save DC of the trap. Spells like freedom of movement or
movement modes like burrow can also allow creatures to
freely move through the sand.
Dynamic Elements. The Falling Sand becomes harder and
harder to avoid over time.
Avalanche of Grains. Each time the Falling Sand activates,
the DC of the saving throws made to avoid becoming buried
or dig creatures out increases by 2. The DC for ability checks
to unlock or push open the locked doors also increases in
this way.
Constant Elements. The Falling Sand is cursed to age any
creature that ends its turn buried within it.
Sands of Time. A creature that ends its turn immobilized
by the Falling Sand must succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving
throw or be aged by 1d10 years.
```

92 Chapter Seven | Complex Traps

```
Countermeasures. The trigger and active elements of the
trap can be thwarted by particular countermeasures.
Trigger. A creature can spot the gaps around the sliding
plate with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check.
The skull sigil has an aura of abjuration magic when viewed
with detect magic and a creature that succeeds on a DC 12
Intelligence (Religion) check understands the nature of the
trap. The sigil can be disabled with dispel magic or a successful
DC 12 spellcasting ability check made by a spellcaster.
Open the Doors. The doors’ lock has been enhanced with
arcane lock , which can be found with detect magic. As an action, a
creature can pick the lock on the doors with a successful DC 12
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. The doors can be pushed
open as an action with a successful DC 12 Strength check.
Block the Sand. Characters who can reach the ceiling of the
chamber can stop the Falling Sand in the following ways:
Slide the Plate. A creature that succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence
(Investigation) check finds a way to unlock the plate, making
it slide back and separate the two chambers.
Replace the Plate. A creature can block the hole in the
chamber’s ceiling by replacing the plate. As an action, a
creature within 5 feet of the hole can block the hole until
the start of their next turn with a shield or similar object by
succeeding on a DC 12 Strength check. Any conjured barrier
that covers the hole also stops the Falling Sand.

Mechanical trap (level 5-8, dangerous, harm)
This trap is triggered by a tripwire set half-way down the
corridor. A repeating ballista hidden in the wall at the end
of a 5-foot wide, 100-foot long corridor fires upon creatures
that trigger the trap, while a barrier drops to block the exit.
Trigger. Tripping the wire triggers the trap.
Initiative. The trap acts on initiative 20, 10, and 5.
Active Elements. The Passageway Piercing fires ballista bolts
down the corridor and drops a wooden barrier across its exit.
Barrier (Initiative 20). This element only activates one,
the first time the trap acts. A 1-foot thick wooden barrier
drops down from the ceiling 10 feet in front of the corridor’s
exit. A creature within 5 feet of the barrier can make a DC
15 Dexterity saving throw. On a success, the creature can
choose which side of the barrier they end up on; on a failure,
they must remain where they are.
Bolts (Initiative 10 and 5). A concealed ballista fires down
the hallway. The first creature in the corridor is targeted by an
attack: +8 attack bonus; 16 (3d10) piercing damage on a hit.
Countermeasures. The trigger and active elements of the
trap can be thwarted by particular countermeasures.
Trigger (Sensitive). A successful DC 15 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the tripwire, and a successful DC
15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trap.
```
```
Barrier. A successful DC 15 Strength check is enough to lift
the barrier high enough for a Medium or smaller creature to
crawl beneath. The barrier can also be destroyed; it has AC
15, 50 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage,
and vulnerability to fire damage.
Bolts. A creature within 5 feet of the concealed ballista can
disable it after 3 rounds of successful ability checks.
```
**- Round 1:** As an action, the creature can locate the
    concealed ballista with a successful DC 15 Intelligence
    (Investigation) check.
- **Round 2:** As an action, the creature can break away the
    concealing plaster with a successful DC 15 Strength check.

Trigger. A creature that steps on the trapdoor activates the
pressure plate, making it swing open.
Initiative. The trap acts on initiative 20 and 10.
Active Elements. Fire Down Below includes a drop and jets
of fire.
Drop (Initiative 20). This element activates only once, the
first time the trap acts. The triggering creature must make a
DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a success, the creature is
able to grab onto the edge of the pit. On a failure, the creature
falls into the pit and takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage.
Flames (Initiative 10). Each creature in the pit must make
a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 14 (4d6) fire
damage on a failure, or half as much on a success.
Constant Elements. The constant flames turn the pit into
an oven.
Heat Exhaustion. A creature that ends its turn in the pit
must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or gain
1 level of exhaustion. Creatures wearing medium or heavy
armor, or who are clad in heavy clothing, have disadvantage
on this saving throw. Creatures with resistance or immunity
to fire damage automatically succeed on this saving throw,
as do creatures normally adjusted to hot climates.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the pressure plate and a successful DC 17
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trap.

_Hybrid trap (level 5-8, deadly, harm)_

There are four gargoyles in the corners of the chamber. The trap
activates when flame is brought into the area; causes magical
bonds of flame erupt and grapple creatures, dealing damage
to them. In addition, poison gas spouts from the mouths of the
gargoyles; once the gas reaches a certain potency, it ignites.

**_Trigger (Produce Flame)_**. Bringing a flame into the chamber
triggers the trap.

**_Initiative_**_._ The trap acts on initiative 20 and 10.

**_Active Elements_**_._ The trap consists of magical restraints
made from flames, and poison gas which fills the room from
pipes in the mouths of the gargoyles.

**Fiery Restraint (Initiative 20)**. This effect activates only
once, the first time the trap acts. Each target within 30 feet
of the triggering flame must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom
saving throw or become restrained and take 10 (3d6) fire
damage. A creature holding the triggering flame makes the
save with disadvantage.

**Locked Doors (Initiative 20).** This effect activates only
once, the first time the trap acts. The exits and entrances to
this room slam shut and are locked in place by magic.

**Poison Gas (Initiative 10).** Poison gas floods the room.
Each creature inside must make a DC 20 Constitution saving
throw, taking 5 (1d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half
as much on a successful one.

**_Dynamic Elements_**_._ The longer the poison gas remains in
the room, the more lethal it becomes. After it hits a certain
concentration, it ignites.

**Increased Potency**. The damage from the Poison Gas
element increases by 5 (1d10) each round after it activates, to
a maximum of 22 (4d10). Once the gas reaches its maximum
damage, the gas ignites the next time it activates. Each
creature in the chamber must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity
saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) fire damage on a failed save,
or half as much on a successful one.

**_Constant Elements_**. The Fiery Restraint affects each creature
that ends its turn restrained.

**Fiery Restraint**. A creature that ends its turn restrained by
the Fiery Restraint takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.

**_Countermeasures_**. The traps trigger and active elements can
be thwarted by particular countermeasures.

**Trigger.** A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check
reveals a _rune of detection_ on the ceiling that reacts to the
presence of the flame. The rune can also be found with
_detect magic_ , which also reveals an aura of evocation magic
around the gargoyle statues. A successful DC 20 Intelligence
(Arcana) check or _dispel magic_ disables the trap.

**Fiery Restraint.** A restrained creature can be freed with
a successful DC 20 Strength check, which deals 10 (3d6)
damage to the creature attempting the check. Casting _dispel
magic_ upon the flame dispels each restraint, and deals no
damage to the caster.

```
Open the Doors. The doors’ lock has been enhanced with
arcane lock , which can be found with detect magic. As an action, a
creature can pick the lock on the doors with a successful DC 30
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. The doors can be pushed
open as an action with a successful DC 30 Strength check.
Poison Gas. The gas can be disabled by blocking the flow
from the gargoyle’s mouths, but heavily damaging a statue
leaves the gas vents open. When all four gargoyles are
blocked up or disabled, the trap deactivates.
Attack. Reducing a gargoyle to 0 hit points (AC 17; 20 hit
points; resistance to fire, piercing, and slashing damage;
immunity to poison and psychic damage), or making a
successful DC 20 Strength check to break one increases the
Poison Gas damage by 5 (1d10).
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, DC 20. A creature can use
thieves’ tools to disable the gas in one of the gargoyles,
reducing the Poison Gas damage by 5 (1d10).
Strength check, DC 15. A creature can block up the gargoyle
with a cloak or similar object, reducing the Poison Gas
damage by 5 (1d10). Once a character succeeds on the check,
someone must remain within 5 feet of the gargoyle to keep it
blocked up.

Hybrid trap (level 9-12, setback, harm)
In the centre of the chamber is a pool of water, glistening
with radiant light. A creature that touches the water triggers
the trap; the floor of the chamber opens like a trap door,
dropping creatures onto spikes. The opening then locks
closed and the spikes slowly rises, trapping creatures
between the ceiling and the spikes.
Trigger (Disturb Liquid). Upsetting the surface of the liquid
triggers the trap.
Initiative. The trap acts on initiative 20, 15, and 10.
Active Elements. The Trapdoor Floor consists of a trapoor,
a drop onto spikes, and then a floor that slowly grinds
upwards, crushing creatures on the spikes.
Drop (Initiative 20). This effect activates only once, the
first time the trap is triggered. Each creature touching the
floor falls as the floor gives way. A creature within 5 feet
of a solid surface, such as the walls of the chamber or the
pool, can grab the edge with a successful DC 10 Dexterity
saving throw. A creature that falls takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning
damage from the 20-foot drop, plus an additional 3 (1d6)
piercing damage from the spiked surface they fall onto.
Lock (Initiative 15). This effect activates only once, the first
time the trap is triggered. The floor swings back into position
and locks. A creature hanging on to the edge of the pit can
drop down into the pit, taking the damage as described above,
before the floor locks shut with a successful DC 10 Dexterity
(Athletics) check, otherwise they end up on top of the floor.
Impaling Spikes (Initiative 10). The impaling spikes
move at a rate of 1 foot per round. They keep moving until
the spikes touch the ceiling of the pit, at which point they
retract. When the spikes enter a creature’s space, it must
make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. If the creature fails
they take 10 (3d6) piercing damage, or half as much on a
success. A creature that fails the Dexterity saving throw is
restrained by being impaled on the spikes.
A creature impaled by spikes can free themselves with a
successful DC 10 Constitution (Athletics) check but not until
there is room equivalent to their size available in front of the
spikes. Another creature can free an impaled creature with a
successful DC 10 Strength (Medicine) check, as long as there
is room. Once the spikes reach the ceiling they retract and
return to their starting point, releasing any impaled creatures.
Constant Elements. The Impaling Spikes damage any
creatures impaled on them.
Spiked Surface. A creature that ends its turn restrained by
the Impaling Spikes takes 3 (1d6) piercing damage.
Countermeasures. The trigger and active elements of the
trap can be thwarted by particular countermeasures.
```
```
Trigger. With a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)
check, a creature can find a rune of detection at the bottom of
the pool; detect magic also reveals the rune. A successful DC
10 Intelligence (Arcana) check or dispel magic cast on the rune
disables the trap.
Lock. As an action, a creature can find the locking
mechanism on the door by succeeding on a DC 10 Wisdom
(Perception) check. With another action, and a successful
DC 10 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a creature can
figure out how to make the door unlock and retract. The
locking mechanism is at the top of the pit, so a creature can,
as an action, disable it with a successful DC 10 Dexterity
check using thieves’ tools as long as they are adjacent to it.
Unlocking the floor ends the trap.
Impaling Spikes. A creature can stop the spikes from
moving by jamming something into the gap between the
surface and the walls of the pit with a successful DC 10
Strength check. Once all four sides of the surface have been
jammed, the surface stops moving.

Mechanical trap (level 9-12, moderate, harm)
Each 5-foot square of the chamber has a large stone
pillar hanging above it. These pillars smash down when
the pressure plate in the centre of the room is triggered.
Additionally, the chamber slowly heats up like an oven as
four vents on the walls pump in hot air.
Trigger (Pressure Plate). Applying 20 pounds or more of
pressure to the pressure plate triggers the trap.
Initiative. The trap acts on initiative 20 and 10.
Active Elements. The Tenderizer makes pillars to smash
down onto creatures within the chamber, and blasts of fire
shoot out from the walls.
Crushing Pillars (Initiative 20). Each creature in the
chamber must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a
failed save, a creature takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage
and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes
half damage and isn’t knocked prone.
Fire Blast (Initiative 10). Each creature in the chamber
must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking
5 (1d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a
successful one.
Dynamic Elements. The Fire Blast becomes more dangerous
the longer the trap remains active.
It’s Getting Hot in Here. After it activates, the Fire Blast
increases in heat; its damage increases by 5 (1d10) to a
maximum of 22 (5d10). While its damage is 10 (2d10) or
greater, it acts on initiative count 20 and 10.
Constant Elements. The Fire Blast affects each creature that
ends its turn in the chamber.
Fire Blast. Any creature that ends its turn within the chamber
must make a saving throw against the Fire Blast effect.

Chapter Seven | Complex Traps 95

**_Countermeasures_**. The trigger and active elements of the
trap can be thwarted by particular countermeasures.

**Trigger (Sensitive).** A successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the pressure plate, and a successful DC 12
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trap.

**Crushing Pillars.** There are several ways to combat the pillars.

_Intelligence (Investigation), DC 12._ As an action, a creature that
can see the Crushing Pillars and succeeds on an Intelligence
(Investigation) check learns how to anticipate the pillars’
movement, giving them advantage on the next Dexterity
saving throw made to avoid the pillars while the creature
isn’t incapacitated.

_Strength, DC 12._ A creature in the chamber can ready an action
to brace against a Crushing Pillar when it smashes down.
The creature has disadvantage on its next Dexterity saving
throw to avoid the pillar. The creature then makes a Strength
check. On a success, the pillar becomes jammed, preventing
it from smashing down on that 5-foot square again until the
trap is reset.

**Fire Blast.** The vents blasting heat can be disabled by
blocking them up. A successful DC 12 Dexterity check using
thieves’ tools, or a successful DC 12 Strength check made to
block up the vent with a cloak or similar object, decreases
the fire damage by 5 (1d10). Once a creature succeeds on the
check, they or another creature must remain next to the vent
to keep it blocked up. When all four vents are blocked in this
manner, the trap deactivates.

_Mechanical trap (level 9-12, dangerous, block)_

The trap is in a 130-foot long, 10-foot wide corridor. A
wall of pipes spans the corridor 90 feet along its length. A
creature that breaks the pipes to get past them releases a
blast of water that pushes creatures back into a swinging
mallet. Beyond the pipes is a doorway exiting the corridor.

**SUGGESTION**

```
This trap begs the question “why would there be pipes
going straight through the middle of the hallway?”
There are many possible answers to this question. The
dungeon denizens might be small or otherwise able to fit
through or around the pipes. Perhaps the hallway isn’t
used often, or the pipes fell into their current position
due to failed structural supports.
```
**_Trigger_**. Breaking the pipes triggers the trap. There is no
room for a Small or larger creature to squeeze through the
pipes, but a creature can see through them via small gaps.
This might allow a creature to teleport past the pipes with a
spell; a creature could also transform into a Tiny animal to
get through the pipes.

```
Initiative. The trap acts on initiative 20 and 10.
Active Elements. Slip-N-Slide unleashes a torrent of water to
blast from the broken pipes, and a swinging mallet sweeps
through the corridor.
Water Blast (Initiative 20). A 60-foot long, 10-foot wide
line of water bursts from the pipes. The first creature hit by
the water must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or
take 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage and be pushed 30 feet away
from the broken pipes. The torrent counts as difficult terrain
when walking into the flow.
Swinging Object - Forward (Initiative 20). An enormous
mallet swings forward in an arc that goes through the
50-foot long area beyond the first 20 feet of the corridor.
Creatures in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 11 (2d10)
bludgeoning damage, is pushed 10 feet toward the pipes, and
falls prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half the
damage and isn’t pushed or knocked prone.
Swinging Object - Backwards (Initiative 10). The
mallet swings backwards, in the same arc as detailed
above. Creatures in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 11 (2d10)
bludgeoning damage, is pushed 10 feet away from the pipes,
and falls prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half
the damage and isn’t pushed or knocked prone.
Constant Elements. The blast of water from the pipes pushes
creatures away each round.
Water Blast. Any creature that ends its turn within the 60-
foot long, 10-foot wide line extending from the broken pipes
must make a saving throw against the Water Blast effect.
Countermeasures. The trigger and active effects of the trap
can be thwarted by particular countermeasures.
Trigger (Difficult). A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals several small cranks and wheels on the pipes.
A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals
that turning these will stop the flow of water into the pipes,
and allows a creature to attempt a DC 15 Dexterity check
while using thieves’ tools to disable the trap.
Water Blast. Once activated, the Water Blast can be turned
off with the same process as described for the Trigger.
Swinging Object. A creature can use its action to anticipate
the swinging of the mallet. They have advantage on their
next Dexterity saving throw made to avoid the Swinging
Object from either direction.
Open the Door. Once they are broken, a creature can move
past the pipes with a successful DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics)
check. The door out of the corridor is 40 feet away from
the broken pipes, and it can be opened as an action with a
successful DC 15 Strength check. Opening the door ends
the trap.

Hybrid trap (level 9-12, perilous, harm)
Glittering crystals float in each of the four corners of this
room, which only has one doorway leading into and out of it.
In the center of the room is a shrine, atop which rests a relic.
Taking the relic from the shrine activates the trap; the doors
lock, and the crystals fire bolts of radiance at the creature
holding the relic.
Trigger (Pick Up/Shift Object). Picking up the relic triggers
the trap.
Initiative. The trap acts on initiative 20 and 15.
Active Elements. Perilous Prisms locks the door, and the
prisms spin rapidly and fire blasts of light at the creature
with the relic.
Locked Doors (Initiative 20). This effect activates only
once, the first time the trap is triggered. The door leading out
of this room slams shut and is locked in place by magic.
Bolts of Light (Initiative 15). The 4 floating crystals each
move up to 30 feet on their turn to get in range of the
creature holding the relic. If they cannot,they target the
closest creature instead. The crystals cast guiding bolt as a
5th-level spell: +10 attack bonus, 28 (8d6) radiant damage
on a hit, attack rolls against the creature hit by the bolt have
advantage until the crystals’ next turn.
Dynamic Elements. Tampering with the crystals in any way
makes them emit a burst of radiance.
Blinding Radiance. Every time a crystal is dispelled, or
each time an attack hits the crystals, they give off a blinding
flash of radiance. Each creature within 30 feet of the
targeted crystal must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving
throw or become blinded until the end of their next turn.
Countermeasures. The trigger and active elements of the
trap can be thwarted by particular countermeasures.
Trigger. A creature that succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence
(Religion) check recognizes the relic and knows the danger
of the trap. A successful DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check
reveals a weight sensitive plate on the shrine beneath the
relic; a successful DC 17 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools
disables the trap.
To bypass the trigger, a creature can attempt to replace the
relic with something of equal weight. The creature must
make a successful DC 17 Intelligence (Perception) check to
accurately estimate the weight of the relic and a successful
DC 17 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to switch the objects.
Failure on either roll activates the trap.
Open the Doors. The doors’ lock has been enhanced with
arcane lock , which can be found with detect magic. As an action,
a creature can pick the lock on the doors with a successful
DC 27 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. The doors can be
pushed open as an action with a successful DC 27 Strength
check. Unlocking the door ends the trap.
```
```
Crystals. The crystals have an aura of evocation magic when
viewed with detect magic. Creatures can smash the crystals or
attempt to dispel them.
Attack. Reducing a crystal to 0 hit points destroys it. Each
crystal has AC 17; 30 hit points; resistance to radiant
damage; and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
Dispel. The enchantment surrounding the crystals can be
dispelled with dispel magic (DC 15), or with a successful DC 17
spellcasting ability made by a spellcaster.

Mechanical trap (level 9-12, deadly, harm)
In the center of this 25-foot square chamber is a large crank;
painted lines around the crank point to a door leading further
into the dungeon. Turning the crank makes a square barrier
drop from the ceiling, blocking the exits. This 15-foot enclosed
area then begins to fill with water from the grated floor. A
creature that attempts to damage the barriers is electrified.
Trigger (Turn Wheel/Crank). Turning the crank triggers
the trap.
Initiative. The trap acts on initiative 20 and 10.
Active Elements. The Flooding Chamber drops barriers,
enclosing creatures in the central 15-foot square of the
room, and fills this space with water from below.
Iron Cage (Initiative 20). A 15-foot square cage drops
down from the ceiling. A creature within 5 feet of the falling
barrier can attempt a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw; a
creature that succeeds can choose which side they end up on
when the barrier falls. Creatures that fail this saving throw
are trapped in the cage.
Flooding Water (Initiative 10). Water begins to fill the
enclosed 15-foot cube in the center of the chamber at a rate
of 5 feet per round.
Dynamic Elements. The metal cage is studded with crystals
that explode with lightning when shattered.
Electrified Cage. Each attack roll that hits the cage makes
it emit a pulse of lightning. The attacking creature, and each
creature touching the water within the cage , must make a
DC 20 Constitution saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) lightning
damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
Constant Elements. The cage slowly fills with water, making
attempts to escape more difficult.
Treading Water. After 2 rounds, the water is at chest height
for Small creatures, and any ability checks made to disable
the trap have disadvantage. Attack rolls to break the cage are
unaffected.
After 3 rounds, the water reaches the top of the cage;
creatures within must hold their breath or drown. Ability
checks made to disable the trap have disadvantage. An attack
roll made by a creature that doesn’t have a swimming speed
(either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage unless
the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.
```

**_Countermeasures_**. The trigger and some active elements of
the trap can be thwarted by particular countermeasures.

**Trigger (Difficult).** A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the hidden mechanisms connected to the
crank. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check
reveals the nature of the trigger, and allows a creature to
disable it with a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using
thieves’ tools.

**Iron Cage.** Reducing a 5-foot square section of the cage to
0 hit points destroys it, allowing the water to pour out into
the chamber harmlessly. Each 5-foot square section of the
cage has AC 20; 50 hit points; resistance to bludgeoning and
slashing damage; and immunity to lightning, poison and
psychic damage.

_Magic trap (level 13-16, setback, block)_

This trap is set in a large chamber with a rune-inscribed door.
When creatures enter the chamber, multiple _walls of force_
appear, turning the chamber into a maze. Then, shards of metal
debris fall into the chamber through portals in the ceiling.

**_Trigger_**. Moving through the door and into the chamber
triggers the trap.

**_Initiative_**_._ The trap acts on initiative 20 and 10.

**_Active Elements_**_._ Rats in a Maze summons several walls of
invisible force and drops debris from portals in the ceiling.

**Walls of Force (Initiative 20)**. This element only activates
once, the first time the trap acts. Invisible walls of force
spring into existence, turning the chamber into a winding
maze. Each wall is made of 10-foot-by-10-foot panels and is
1/4 inch thick. If a wall cuts through a creature’s space when it
appears, the creature is pushed to a random side of the wall.

**Falling Objects (Initiative 10).** Portals open above the
maze and disgorge shards of metal into the chamber. Each
creature in the chamber must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 3 (1d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or
half as much on a successful one.

**_Dynamic Elements_**_._ The amount of metal coming from the
portals increases every round.

**Additional Debris**. After it activates, the damage from
Falling Objects increases by 3 (1d6) to a maximum of 14
(4d6). While its damage is 7 (2d6) or greater, it acts on
initiative count 20 and 10. There are portals above every
5-foot square of the room’s floor, but only some of them
open up at a time, depending on how much damage this
effect deals.

**_Constant Elements_**. The Falling Objects affects any creature
that ends its turn in the chamber.

**Falling Objects**. Any creature that ends its turn in the
chamber must make a saving throw against the Falling
Objects effect.

```
Countermeasures. The trigger and active elements of the
trap can be thwarted by particular countermeasures.
Trigger. A creature that succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence
(Arcana) check can recognize and interpret the runes on
the door, revealing the danger of the trap. The runes also
have an aura of evocation magic when viewed with detect
magic. The runes can be disabled with dispel magic (DC 14) or
with a successful DC 10 spellcasting ability check made by a
spellcaster.
Navigating the Maze. A creature can deduce the path of the
maze as an action with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Survival)
check. This allows a creature to progress through the maze,
which fills the room. Once a creature successfully completes
the maze, by either reaching the center or the way out of the
room, the trap ends.
Removing the Walls. The walls can be found with detect
magic ; a creature that runs into a wall can figure out what it is
with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Nothing
can physically pass through the walls of force. They are
immune to all damage and can’t be dispelled by dispel magic.
A disintegrate spell destroys a wall instantly, however. The
wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal
travel through the wall.
Closing the Portals. A 5-foot square portal can be closed by
casting dispel magic on it. This prevents debris from falling in
the 5-foot square portal beneath it.

Hybrid trap (level 13-16, moderate, harm)
This trap takes place in a chamber filled with artisan tools,
such as cook’s tools, smith’s tools, or mason’s tools. When a
creature breaks the tripwire, a magical gas pours forth from
a vat, putting creatures in the chamber to sleep. The tools
then animate and attack the creatures in the room.
Trigger (Tripwire). Breaking the tripwire triggers the trap.
Initiative. The trap acts on initiative 20 and 10.
Active Elements. A vat in the chamber produces a magic
sleep-inducing gas. The tools scattered around the chamber
animate and attack creatures within.
Sleep Gas (Initiative 20). Each creature in the chamber
must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or
fall asleep for 1 minute. Creatures put to sleep in this way
remain unconscious until the effect ends, the sleeper takes
damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the
sleeper awake. Undead, constructs, and creatures that don’t
need to sleep aren’t affected by this effect.
A creature that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to
the Sleep Gas for 1 hour.
Animated Objects (Initiative 10). The tools around the
room animate and attack creatures that are not unconscious.
The trap animates 4 objects, and each object makes one
attack against a random target: +6 attack bonus, 7 (2d6)
slashing damage on a hit.
```

98 Chapter Seven | Complex Traps

```
Dynamic Elements. More tools animate the longer the trap
remains active.
More the Merrier. After their turn, the number of
Animated Objects increases by four. There can be no more
than 12 animated tools at any one time.
Constant Elements. A creature that ends its turn in the sleep-
inducing gas is affected by it, unless they are immune to it.
Sleep Gas. Each creature that ends its turn in the chamber
must make a saving throw against the Sleep Gas, unless they
are immune or already unconscious.
Countermeasures. The trigger and active elements of the
trap can be thwarted by particular countermeasures.
Trigger (Sensitive). A successful DC12 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the tripwire, and a successful DC 12 Dexterity
check using thieves’ tools disables the trap.
Sleep Gas. The vat producing the sleep-inducing gas can be
deactivated by a creature within 5 feet of it. As an action, the
creature can locate magic runes on the vat with a successful
DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature can
then dispel those runes with dispel magic (DC 15); as an action,
a creature can also disrupt the runes with a successful
DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check. Once the vat has been
deactivated, the trap ends.
Animated Objects. Each object can be destroyed by
attacking it (AC 12; 12 hit points; immunity to poison and
psychic damage) or by casting dispel magic on it. Characters
can take the Dodge action to give the objects disadvantage
on attack rolls against them.

Magic trap (level 13-16, dangerous, harm)
In the center of this chamber is a plinth with a kraken
statuette atop it. When a weapon is drawn in the chamber,
the statuette creates an illusory kraken that induces fear in
nearby creatures. Additionally, the illusory tentacles attack,
dealing psychic damage to creatures they hit. Creatures can
leave through the door they entered, or search for a secret
door which allows them to progress.
Trigger (Draw Weapon). Drawing a weapon or bringing an
unsheathed weapon into the chamber triggers the trap.
Initiative. The trap acts on initiative 20 and 10.
Active Elements. The Aspect of the Kraken creates an
illusory kraken that scares creatures and attacks them with
phantasmal tentacles.
Kraken Fear (Initiative 20). An illusion of a manifests
around the statuette. All creatures within 30 feet of the
statuette must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or
become frightened. A creature frightened this way must take
the Dash action and move away from the statuette area by
the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is
nowhere to move.
```
```
If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t
have line of sight to the illusory kraken, the creature can
make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save,
this effect ends for that creature.
Once a creature succeeds on their Wisdom saving throw to
resist the Kraken Fear, they are immune to it for 1 hour.
Illusory Tentacles (Initiative 10). The illusory kraken
has eight tentacles. Each tentacle makes an attack against
a random creature holding a weapon within 30 feet of the
statuette: +8 attack bonus, 11 (2d10) psychic damage on a hit.
Dynamic Elements. Tampering with the kraken idol increases
the trap’s power.
Kraken Idol. Each successful ability check made to disable
the statuette increases the damage of the Illusory Tentacles by
5 (1d10) and increases the DC of the Wisdom saving throw to
resist the Kraken Fear by 1.
Constant Elements. The Kraken Fear and Illusory Tentacles
affect each creature that ends its turn within 30 feet of the
kraken idol
Kraken Fear. Any creature that ends its turn within 30 feet
of the kraken idol must make a saving throw against the
Kraken Fear, unless they are immune.
Illusory Tentacles. Any creature that ends its turn within
30 feet of the kraken idol is targeted by an attack: +8 attack
bonus; 5 (1d10) psychic damage on a hit.
Countermeasures. The trigger and active elements of
the trap can be thwarted by particular countermeasures.
Additionally, creatures can escape the trap by locating a
secret door.
Trigger. A creature that succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence
(Religion) check recognizes the kraken statuette and
understands the danger of the trap. The statuette also has
an aura of illusion magic when viewed with detect magic. A
spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the statuette
with a successful DC 15 spellcasting ability check; dispel magic
DC (DC 16) also disables the trap. This can be done before or
after the trap activates.
Kraken Ilusion. Once activated, the illusory kraken can be
dispelled with dispel magic (DC 16). A creature that succeeds
on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check recognizes that
the kraken is an illusion. Once a creature knows the kraken
isn’t real, it is immune to Kraken Fear and resistance to the
psychic damage from the Illusory Tentacles.
Secret Door. If creatures can locate and unlock a secret
door, they can escape the chamber. To locate the door, a
creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)
check. Once the door has been found, it can be unlocked with
a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.

_Mechanical trap (level 13-16, perilous, harm)_

This trap is set in a 140-foot long corridor, which has a
pressure plate by the entrance. Applying weight to the
pressure plate triggers it, and a chain snare catches the
triggering creature around the ankle. The snare then drags
the creature through a series of effects triggered by the
initial pressure plate.

**_Trigger (Pressure Plate)_**. Applying 20 pounds or more of
pressure to the pressure plate triggers the trap.

**_Initiative_**_._ The trap acts on initiative 20, 15, and 10.

**_Active Elements_**_._ What A Drag snares the triggering creature
in the first 5 feet of the trap. It then drags them through the
corridor ahead, which fires poison darts in the next 60-
foot long area, and scything blades which swing across the
corridor in the next 60-foot long area. There is a 10-foot gap
between the poison darts and the scything blades

**Chain Snare (Initiative 20)**. This element activates only
once, the first time the trap acts. A chain snare catches
around the triggering creature’s ankle. The target must
succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or become
restrained by the snare until freed.

**Poison Darts (Initiative 15).** Darts fire across the corridor
in the 60-foot long area past the first 10 feet. The darts make
one attack roll against each creature in the area with a +10
bonus to the attack roll. A creature hit by a dart must make
a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 33
(6d10) poison damage and becomes poisoned on a failed
save, or takes half the damage and isn’t poisoned on a
successful one.

**Scything Blades (Initiative 10).** Scything blades swing
across the corridor in the 60-foot long area past the first
70 feet. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 17
Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) slashing damage on
a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

**_Constant Elements_**. The Chain Snare drags creatures down the
corridor, and the Darts and Scything Blades affect any creature
that ends its turn in an area affected by these elements.

**Chain Snare.** The snare drags any creature restrained by it
60 feet down the corridor.

**Poison Darts**. Any creature that ends its turn in the 60-foot
long area past the first 10 feet of the corridor is targeted by
the Poison Darts element.

**Scything Blades.** Any creature that ends its turn in the
60-foot long area past the first 70 feet of the corridor must
make a saving throw against the Scything Blades element.

```
Countermeasures. The trigger and active elements of the
trap can each be thwarted by particular countermeasures.
Trigger (Sensitive). A successful DC 17 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the pressure plate, and a
successful DC 17 Dexterity check while using thieves’ tools
disables the trigger. Disabling the trigger, either before or
after the trap activates, disables the trap.
Chain Snare. As an action, a creature can be free
themselves from the snare or a creature restrained by the
snare with a successful DC 18 Strength check. The snare can
also be destroyed: it has AC 18; 20 hit points; resistance to
bludgeoning and slashing damage; and immunity to poison
and psychic damage.
Poison Darts. The darts can be disabled by closing the holes
through which they fire. First, a creature must succeed on
a DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check to uncover the holes. A
creature can then stuff cloth or some other material in the
holes as an action.
Scything Blades. Characters can smash the blades, damage
their components, or discern how to avoid them. The blades
are disabled if the Dexterity saving throw DC made to avoid
them is reduced below 10. Ways to do that are described below.
Intelligence (Investigation), DC 17. As an action, a creature that
can see the blades can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation)
check. A successful check means that the creature has
learned how to anticipate the blades’ movement, giving
them advantage on the next Dexterity saving throw
made by the creature to avoid the blades while they aren’t
incapacitated.
Attack. A creature in the area can ready an attack to strike at
a blade as it passes by. The creature has disadvantage on its
next Dexterity saving throw made to avoid the blades. The
creature then attacks. Each blade has AC 15; 15 hit points;
and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Destroying a
blade reduces the Scything Blades saving throw DC by 2.
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, DC 17. Creatures can use thieves’
tools in the blade’s area to foil its mechanism. A successful
check reduces the Scything Blades saving throw DC by 2.

floor takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage from the Spikes.

**Fire Blast.** Any creature that ends its turn standing on the
flaming oil must make a saving throw against the Fire Blast
element, at its current DC.

**_Countermeasures_**. The trigger and active elements can be
thwarted by particular countermeasures.

**Trigger.** A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check or
_detect magic_ reveals the _rune of detection_. Once found, it can
be disrupted with a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana)
check or casting _dispel magic_ on the rune. Once the trigger is
disabled, the trap deactivates.

**Fire Blast.** Any spell or other effect that generates a large
quantity of ice, water, or a blast of cold prevents creatures
from taking damage from the Fire Blast during the round the
effect happens.

_Hybrid trap (level 17-20, moderate, harm)_

An ornate chandelier hangs from the ceiling of this circular
chamber. Any creature that passes directly beneath the
chandelier triggers the trap. The doors lock, and spiked
chains extend from the chandelier, which begins to spin
rapidly. Finally, a beam of magical energy shoots down
directly beneath the chandelier. Any creature that enters this
beam is transformed into a beetle.

**_Trigger (Creature Detector)_**. Walking directly beneath the
chandelier triggers the trap.

**_Initiative_**_._ The trap acts on initiative 20 and 10.

**_Active Elements_**_._ Necessary Weevil first locks the doors.
Chains then extend from the chandelier which starts to
spin, and a beam of transmutation magic shoots down from
beneath the chandelier.

**Locked Doors (Initiative 20).** This effect activates only
once, the first time the trap acts. The exits and entrances to
this room slam shut and are locked in place by magic. Tiny
creatures can crawl beneath the door frames.

**Flailing Chains (Initiative 20)**. Chains extend from the
chandelier, and it begins to spin rapidly. Each creature
within 10 feet of the chamber walls must make a DC 12
Dexterity saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) slashing damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Tiny
creatures are unaffected.

```
Transmutation (Initiative 10). This effect activates only
once, the first time the trap acts. A beam of transmutation
magic energy shoots down from the chandelier. Each
creature in the 5-foot square beneath the chandelier must
succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or be transformed
into a beetle (use the statistics for a frog statistics) for 1 hour.
This effect ends if dispelled ( dispel magic DC 18), or if the
creature drops to 0 hit points or dies, and it doesn’t work on
a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points.
A transformed creature’s game statistics, including mental
ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the beast it
transforms into. It retains its alignment and personality.
The creature assumes the hit points of its new form. When
it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the
number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it
reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess
damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess
damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit
points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.
A transformed creature is limited in the actions it can
perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast
spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.
The creature’s gear melds into the new form. It can’t activate,
use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
Dynamic Elements. The chandelier spins ever faster,
becoming more dangerous the longer the trap remains active.
Increased Speed. After it activates, the damage from the
Flailing Chains increases by 10 (3d6). While its damage is 35
(10d6) or greater, it acts on initiative 20 and 10.
Constant Elements. The Flailing Chains and Transmutation
affect each creature that ends its turn in an area affected by
these elements.
Flailing Chains. A creature that ends its turn within 10 feet
of the chamber walls must make a saving throw against the
Flailing Chains effect.
Transmutation. A creature that ends its turn directly
beneath the chandelier must make a saving throw against
the Transmutation effect.
Countermeasures. The trap’s trigger and active elements can
each be thwarted by particular countermeasures.
Trigger. The chandelier has an aura of transmutation magic
when viewed with detect magic , and a creature that gets close
enough to it can find arcane symbols on the chandelier with
successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check. The chandelier
can be disabled with a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana)
check, or with dispel magic (DC 18). Disabling the chandelier
deactivates the trap.
Open the Doors. The doors’ lock has been enhanced with
arcane lock , which can be found with detect magic. As an action, a
creature can pick the lock on the doors with a successful DC 22
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. The doors can be pushed
open as an action with a successful DC 22 Strength check.
```

102 Chapter Seven | Complex Traps

```
Flailing Chains. Characters can pull down the chains,
damage the chandelier components, or discern how to avoid
the chains. The chains are disabled if the Dexterity saving
throw DC made to avoid them is reduced below 5. Ways to do
that are described below.
Intelligence (Investigation), DC 12. As an action, a creature that
can see the chains can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation)
check. A successful check means that the creature has learned
how to anticipate the chains’ movements, giving them
advantage on the next Dexterity saving throw made by the
creature to avoid the chains while they aren’t incapacitated.
Strength, DC 12. A creature in the area can ready a Strength
check to pull down a chain as it passes by. The creature has
disadvantage on its next Dexterity saving throw made to
avoid the chans. The creature then makes the check. On a
success, the chain is destroyed. Destroying a chain reduces
the Flailing Chains saving throw DC by 2.
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, DC 12. Creatures can use
thieves’ tools within 5 feet of the chandelier to foil its
mechanism. A successful check reduces the Flailing Chains
saving throw DC by 2.
Transmutation. As an action, a spellcaster directly beneath
the chandelier can disrupt the beam of transmutation magic
with a successful DC 12 spellcasting ability check; dispel magic
(DC 18) also disables this element.

Hybrid trap (level 17-20, dangerous, hinder)
The trap is set in a 200-foot long corridor. Stepping on a
pressure plate at the start of the corridor releases a bolt of
lightning, aimed at the triggering creature, from the far end
of the corridor. A thunderous boom echoes throughout the
corridor, potentially deafening the creatures.
Trigger. Applying weight to the pressure plate triggers
the trap.
Initiative. The trap acts on initiative 20, 15 and 10.
Active Elements. Bolts of lightning shoot down the corridor
from the far end. A thunderous boom erupts, knocking back
and deafening creatures.
Lightning Bolt (Initiative 20). A stroke of lightning
forming a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide blasts hurtles
from the far end of the corridor to the entrance. Each
creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 35 (10d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.
Thunderclap (Initiative 15). A booming thunderclap fills the
corridor. Each creature in the corridor takes 17 (5d6) thunder
damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw
or be pushed 30 feet back toward the corridor’s entrance.
Deafening Echoes (Initiative 10). The echoes of the
thunderclap resound through the corridor, reaching
deafening volumes. Each creature in the corridor that can
```
```
hear the echoes must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw or become deafened. A creature remains deafened for
1 minute after they leave the corridor.
Dynamic Elements. The echoing of the thunderclap gets
worse with each successive blast.
Bursting Eardrums. After the Deafening Echoes activates,
the saving throw DC to resist being deafened increases by 2.
Countermeasures. The trap’s trigger can be thwarted by
particular countermeasures. The active elements of the trap
end when creatures leave the corridor through the door at
the far end, which is locked.
Trigger (Sensitive). A successful DC 15 Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the pressure plate, and a
successful DC 15 Dexterity check while using thieves’ tools
disables the trap. Unfortunately, disabling the pressure plate
after the trap is active doesn’t deactivate it.
Leave the Corridor. Leaving the corridor through the
far end deactivates the trap. The door at the far end of the
corridor is locked. It can be unlocked over 3 rounds with the
following ability checks, each of which takes an action.
```
- **Round 1.** A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check
    to locate the locking mechanism.
**- Round 2.** A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check
    to understand the workings of the lock.
**- Round 3.** A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using
    thieves’ tools to unlock the door.

```
F F
Complex trap (level 17-20, perilous, harm)
This chamber has an ornate, tiled mosaic on the floor which
depicts spiralling portals. Stepping on one of the mosaic
portals triggers the trap, which opens real portals below the
triggering creature and above it. The trap also conjures a wall
of blades between the two portals.
Trigger (Creature Detector). Stepping onto one of the mosaic
portals on the floor triggers the trap.
Initiative. The trap acts on initiative 20.
Active Elements. Free Falling opens two linked portals and
summons a wall of blades.
Portals (Initiative 20). This effect activates only once, the
first time the trap acts. A portal appears directly above and
below the triggering creature, 10 feet apart. The portals remain
active until dispelled or otherwise deactivated. The triggering
creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be
trapped in a loop, falling from one portal to the other.
Wall of Blades (Initiative 20). A horizontal wall of
whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical energy
appears between the two portals. The wall is 20 feet square
and 5 feet thick.
Dynamic Elements. The longer the trap remains active, the
more dangerous it becomes.
```

Chapter Seven | Complex Traps 103

**Terminal Velocity**. Each turn the trap remains active, the
creature falling through the portals speeds up. Their falling
speed is equal to the number of rounds the trap has been
active. A creature falls through the Wall of Blades at more
and more points in a round depending on their falling speed,
as shown in the table below.

```
Falling Speed Enters Wall of Blades on...
```
```
1 Initiative 20
2 Initiative 20 and 10
```
```
3 Initiative 20, 15, and 10
4 Initiative 20, 15, 10, and 5
```
```
5 Initiative 20, 15, 10, 5, and 0
```
**_Constant Elements_**. The Wall of Blades damages creatures
that pass through it.

**Wall of Blades.** When a creature enters the wall’s area for
the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature
must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save,
the creature takes 33 (6d10) slashing damage. On a successful
save, the creature takes half as much damage.

**_Countermeasures_**. The trap’s trigger and active elements can
be thwarted by particular countermeasures.

**Trigger.** A creature that succeeds on a DC 17 Intelligence
(Arcana) check or recognizes the mosaics and understands the
danger they hide. The mosaics also have an aura of conjuration
and evocation magic when viewed with _detect magic_.

A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the mosaics
with a successful DC 17 spellcasting ability check; _dispel magic_
(DC 19) cast on the mosaics also disables the trap.

**Portals.** Once activated, faint arcane symbols surround each
portal. As an action, a creature can examine the runes and
successfully disrupt their function with a successful DC 17
Intelligence (Arcana) check, closing one portal. Alternatively,
a portal can be closed with _dispel magic_ (DC 19). Closing a
portal reduces the falling speed of a creature caught between
them by 1.

If one of the portals is closed, the other remains open. This
means that a creature falling between them slams into the
floor, taking bludgeoning damage equal to their falling speed
multiplied by 7 (2d6).

**Wall of Blades.** The whirling blades can be disrupted,
attacked, or dispelled. The Wall of Blades vanishes if its damage
is reduced to 0 (0d10). Ways to do that are described below.

_Spellcasting ability check, DC 17._ As an action, a creature that
can see the Wall of Blades can attempt a spellcasting ability
check to disrupt the magic that sustains it. On a success, the
wall’s damage is reduced by 5 (1d10).

_Attack._ A creature within 5 feet of the Wall of Blades can
attack it: the wall has AC 17. On a hit, the blade barrier is
partially disrupted, and its damage is reduced by 5 (1d10).

_Dispel magic, DC 17._ A successful casting of _dispel magic_ reduces
the blade barrier’s damage by 11 (2d10).

```
M P
Complex trap (level 17-20, deadly, harm)
A creature that brings a spellcasting focus into this chamber
triggers the trap. An obsidian monolith in the center of the
chamber emits a petrifying aura, and boulders begin flying
around the chamber, smashing into creatures. Finally, acid
bubbles up from the chamber floor; both the boulders and acid
have potentially catastrophic effects for petrified creatures.
Trigger (Bring Object). Bringing a spellcasting focus into the
chamber triggers the trap.
Initiative. The trap acts on initiative 20, 15, and 10.
Active Elements. Melting Pot creates an aura of petrification
magic, animates boulders that fly in circles around the
chamber, and makes acid seep up through the floor.
Aura of Petrification (Initiative 20). A wave of
petrification magic sweeps out from the monolith. Each
creature within 60 feet of the central monolith must
make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
creatures are restrained as their flesh begins to harden. On a
successful save, a creature isn’t affected.
Animated Boulders (Initiative 15). Boulders surrounding
the monolith animate, and fly around the chamber in circles.
Each creature in the chamber must make a DC 20 Dexterity
saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
If a petrified creature takes more than 50 damage in a single
turn from a boulder, one random limb is smashed to pieces.
A creature reduced to 0 hit points by damage from this
source is obliterated. An obliterated creature and everything
it is wearing or carrying, except magic items, are reduced to
a pile of broken stone. The creature can be restored to life
only by true resurrection or wish.
Seeping Acid (Initiative 10). Corrosive acid bubbles up
from the chamber floor. Each creature standing on the floor
of the chamber must make a DC 20 Constitution saving
throw, taking 17 (5d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.
If a petrified creature is reduced to 0 hit points by damage
from the acid, it melts. A melted creature and everything it
is wearing, except magic items, are reduced to slurry. The
creature can be restored to life only by true resurrection or a wish.
Dynamic Elements. Each of the trap’s active elements
becomes more dangerous the longer the trap remains active.
The boulders speed up and the acid becomes more corrosive.
Boulders Accelerate. After it activates, the damage from
Animated Boulders increases by 7 (2d6), to a maximum of 87
(25d6). While its damage is 35 (10d6) or greater, this element
acts on initiative 15 and 10.
Corrosion Concentrates. After its turn, the damage from
Seeping Acid increasing by 7 (2d6), to a maximum of 87 (25d6).
Constant Elements. The trap’s active elements affect each
creature that ends its turn in an area affected by these elements.
```

104 Chapter Seven | Complex Traps

```
Monolith. The trap can be deactivated only be destroying
the monolith, which also restores all creatures it has turned
to stone, ending the petrified effect on them. Ways to destroy
the monolith are described below.
Attack. A character can attack the monolith. It has AC 20; 250
hit points; resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing
damage from non-magical weapons; and immunity to acid,
poison, and psychic damage.
Dispel Magic, DC 19. Casting dispel magic on the monolith deals
25 damage to the monolith.
Spellcasting ability check, DC 20. As an action, a spellcaster can
disrupt the enchantment on the monolith with a successful
DC 20 spellcasting ability check, dealing 25 damage to it.
```
```
Aura of Petrification. A creature restrained by this
element must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at
the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against
this effect three times, the effect ends for that creature. If
it fails its save three times, it is turned into a stone statue
and is petrified. The successes and failures don’t need to be
consecutive; keep track of both until the creature collects
three of a kind.
For each affected creature, this effect lasts until dispelled,
either with dispel magic (DC 19) or greater restoration , or when
the monolith is destroyed. If a creature is physically broken
while petrified, it suffers from similar deformities if it
reverts to its original state.
If a creature successfully saves against this element three
times, they are immune to it for 1 hour.
Animated Boulders. Any creature that ends its turn
within the chamber must make a saving throw against the
Animated Boulders effect.
Seeping Acid. Any creature that ends its turn standing on
the floor of the chamber must make a saving throw against
the Seeping Acid effect.
Countermeasures. The trigger and active elements of the
trap can each be thwarted by particular countermeasures.
Trigger (Difficult). A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana)
check reveals the negating symbols covering the monolith,
alerting a creature to the trap. The monolith has an aura
of transmutation magic when viewed with detect magic. A
successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a
creature to find the right symbols to deface with a successful
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check, disabling the trap. A
successful dispel magic (DC 20) spell cast on the monolith also
disables the trap.
Animated Boulders. A creature who takes the Dodge action
can make their next saving throw against the Animated
Boulders with advantage.

Chapter Eight | Designing Traps 105

DESIGNING TRAPS

When designing your traps, consider what your adventure
needs. If the dungeon has a particular theme, such as snakes,
then perhaps the traps poison their targets or release
monstrous snake creatures. If the dungeon has an acid
theme then the traps could blast creatures with acid, release
oozes, or drop creatures into pools of acid.

Before you start designing your trap, it is important to
ask yourself some questions to help give yourself a clear
understanding of what you need to accomplish with it. Here
are some to get you started:

- Should the trap be complex or simple?
- Who or what is creating this trap?
- How is it powered?
- Why is it needed in this particular spot?
- How do those that live or work in the area get around it?
- What experience do you want the players, not their
    characters, to have when they reach it?
    - Should this be a quick or lengthy encounter?
    - Will the method for overcoming the trap be readily
       apparent when they reach the trap, or will they have
       an opportunity to learn about it beforehand?
          - What is the trap mechanically supposed to accomplish?
             - Actually killing characters?
             - Getting characters to use up resources such as spells
                or abilities prior to a big encounter?
             - Eating up time?
             - Setting the mood or conveying plot details?
             - If the trap takes more resources from the characters
                than intended, how will things likely go for them
                once they get through? Will there be an area and/or
                resources that allow for recovery, or will they simply
                have to cope with the setback?
             - Could this kill the entire party? If it does, how will
                you deal with that?
Answering questions like these will help to set you on a firm
footing and give you a clear vision of what your trap needs
to do and how it needs to do it. It will also help you decide on
the trap’s severity.


106 Chapter Eight | Designing Traps

```
When selecting and implementing traps, think about who
is building these traps, how sophisticated they are, and why
they were built in the first place. For example, a troop of
goblins in the forest are likely to have many nets, snares, and
poison darts set up to capture or kill their prey. On the other
hand, a group of cultists trying to protect the relics in their
deity's temple could have traps designed to blast intruders
with elemental magic, fatally wound them with scything
blades, or crush them to death with closing walls.
The space a trap occupies matters in terms of how things
physically fit together. If a dungeon is built into a hill, but
the internal ceiling of the dungeon is just below ground level
outside, things that rise up into the ceiling would stick out of
the ground above. Creatures walking along would certainly
wonder about a large, random-seeming portcullis sticking
up out of an otherwise picturesque grassy hillside.
```
```
The Purpose of Traps
Traps are obstacles for the characters to overcome. When
planning a trap, consider whether or not you want the
characters to find it. A trap that the characters are likely
to find with ability checks or spells makes them expend
resources overcoming the trap, as well as providing an
interesting and exciting challenge.
A trap that the characters shouldn’t be able to find, usually
because the DC to spot it is very high, can provide a nasty
surprise. It could serve as a warning that the characters
aren’t prepared to enter a specific area, or it can be
something they stumble into to further the plot of the story
you are telling.
However, don’t keep a trap hidden or make it extremely
hard to find when it would certainly kill one or more of the
characters or make it impossible for them to achieve their
goal. The characters should have a fair chance to spot a trap
that deadly and have a good shot at avoiding its effects.
The point of such a trap is not, in fact, to kill anyone or to
derail the adventure; it's to confront characters with a life-
or-death, win-or-lose challenge that they must overcome.
Realizing that everything is on the line has a wonderfully
clarifying effect. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, “nothing
in life is so exhilarating as being shot at and missed!”
It is always your responsibility as the GM to be prepared for
the worst-case scenario when players encounter any traps
you use or create. With this thought process as a guide, you
can design traps that are not only clever and devious, but
that also further the plot and heighten excitement.
```
```
C B T
At some point, your player characters may wish to build
their own traps in your campaign. There are many ways to
handle this scenario, and many details to consider.
If a character tries to build a trap in the middle of a game,
try to glean from the player what they're hoping the trap will
accomplish. Then, consult Chapter 9 and use the Random
Trap Generator to determine what trap trigger and effect
would best suit their trap. If a player asks about this outside
of the game, you may instead choose to explore this chapter
with them and design a trap from the ground up together
that best suits their character's needs.
Other things to consider for character-created traps may
include how long it takes to set up a trap of that type (digging
a pit, rigging a hidden weapon, etc.) and what materials are
needed to create the trap. It is up to your discretion as a GM
to determine how realistic you wish the character's trap
creation experience to be.
```
```
Simple Traps
A simple trap usually has a single trigger and a single effect,
either of which could be magic or mundane. Simple traps do
not reset after they’ve been triggered.
```
```
Complex Traps
A complex trap is any that goes beyond having a single
trigger and a single effect. It might be a gauntlet of
obstacles, a trap that has multiple phases, or a trap that can
be triggered by several different things. The intricacies of
building complex traps are addressed in Chapter 7.
```
```
Complex Triggers
A simple trigger is typically binary, something that is just on or
off, such as a switch or button. A multi-stage trigger, however,
is one that goes in phases or that has multiple requirements.
One of the scariest real world traps is a carnivorous plant
called the venus fly trap. It catches flies and other small
insects when they land on its specially evolved leaves. These
leaves have many sensitive hair-like protrusions, and the
trap only closes when two different hairs are touched within
20 seconds. This helps the plant avoid false triggers.
A locked door with a swinging log hanging behind it, ready to
smash any intruders, is a simple trap. But to keep inhabitants
of the dungeon from being pulped, the engineer installed it
with a multi-stage trigger. If the lock is disabled with thieves’
tools, and if the door is then opened, the trap activates. These
measures prevent the trap going off when an unintended
target unlocks the door with a key and opens it.
```

Chapter Eight | Designing Traps 107

```
Level and Lethality
The overall difficulty or threat your trap can pose to
characters is a combination of two things: the level of the
characters encountering it and the trap’s lethality.
Level. A trap’s level is expressed as one of five ranges: 1-4,
5-8, 9-12, 13-16, and 17-20. An appropriate trap will be in the
range that includes the average level of your characters.
Lethality. Variable statistics for a trap such as attack bonus,
damage, ability check and saving throw DC’s, and spell
level all depend on the trap’s lethality. A trap intended
to be a setback is unlikely to seriously harm characters
of the indicated levels, but a moderate trap likely will. A
dangerous trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially
kill) characters of the indicated levels and a perilous
trap almost definitely will. A deadly trap is likely to kill
characters of the indicated levels.
Always consider the message that traps of various lethalities
and their placement can convey to the players. For example,
placing a setback trap near the entrance of the dungeon
may help to warn the players that there are probably more
traps inside. This should tip them off to beware. Placing a
dangerous trap at the entrance, however, could tip them off
that they might need more supplies, such as potions of healing ,
or let them know that they aren’t of an appropriate level for
this area. These are just a few ways that traps can be used to
set expectations and tone.
```
```
Trap Attacks
Traps attack creatures in one of two ways. If a creature’s
armor is the main or only thing that could defend against
the attack, or if the trap is attacking with a small number of
separate weapons, the trap rolls an attack roll against the
creature’s AC. If a trap would make 6 or more attacks in a
single turn, creatures should roll a Dexterity saving throw to
avoid damage. A creature takes no damage if they succeed
and half damage if they fail.
```
```
Trap Damage
Not all traps deal damage, but those that do should be
designed as an appropriate challenge. Traps deal damage
based on their severity, either to a single target with attack
rolls or to multiple targets if they make a group of creatures
roll a saving throw. The trap can deal its damage all at once
or over several rounds, but the maximum damage it deals
shouldn’t be more than the value indicated for its severity.
```
Complex Effects

Pairing two or more trap effects can add complexity to the
encounter, especially when one effect restrains or confines
characters to one area. A trap that restrains creatures with
a net makes it much harder for them to run away from a
boulder rolling towards them.

Traps as Plot Devices

Traps should be exciting and memorable moments, not
frustrating or boring. Avoid situations where characters
have no countermeasures against a trap; make them
engaging or interesting, not just a way to drain resources.
Traps can provide information about the area, take
characters to parts of a dungeon, or give clues about the
owner or creator of a structure.

Some traps may be detectable, but require characters to have
prior knowledge of their existence or some specific piece of
information to bypass them or disable them. A successful
Intelligence (History, Nature, or Religion) check, depending
on the context, can all provide these kinds of clues. The DC
for these checks is based on the trap’s severity.

For example, if the characters are in a dungeon of some
evil antagonist where countless other heroes have lost
their lives, there is likely to be some information about the
dungeon written down in books. An Intelligence (History)
check may be appropriate to reveal clues about possible
magical triggers they may find (if anyone got out, able to
tell the tale). While exploring the crypt of a long dead and
once powerful paladin, searching for an ancient relic, an
Intelligence (Religion) check might reveal information about
the tomb’s defenses.

Even if these checks don’t give details about the traps
themselves, they may give clues about those who might have
set them, or important information that could be creatively
applied to the situation.

Traps can provide information even after they've been
activated. Finding evidence of triggered traps — such as
corpses, burns, rubble, or blood — can let characters know to
be wary or that someone else is after the same thing they are.

TRAP DURATION

Most traps have an instantaneous effect; they deal damage or drop a creature into a pit. But some traps, especially magical
ones, have spell effects with a duration. If the duration isn’t specified in its description, use the table below to determine the
length of the duration, based on character level and severity of the trap.

In most cases, a trap effect with a set duration can be removed with a spell like _dispel magic_ , _remove curse_ , _lesser restoration_ ,
_greater restoration_ , or more powerful magic. An effect with a permanent duration can only be removed with _greater restoration_ ,
or something more powerful like _wish._ Spells that can remove a trap effect with a duration are listed in their descriptions.

EXPERIENCE REWARDS FOR TRAPS
Traps do not have a CR, like creatures, but if you feel it is appropriate to award experience for overcoming traps you can use
the values in the table below. If awarding experience points for traps would adversely affect the overall pacing or balance
of your campaign, don’t do it. Maintaining a good flow is far more important than ensuring that every task or challenge the
characters overcome has a numerical value.

Chapter Nine | Random Trap Generator 111

RANDOM TRAP GENERATOR

Over time, all GMs develop habits. When we need ideas our
favorites come back again and again, until our dungeons
and adventures start falling into familiar patterns.
Random tables are powerful tools to help break those
patterns, because they force us to incorporate elements or
combinations that wouldn't spring to mind naturally.

In this chapter, you will find a set of tables for the two
crucial parts of a trap: a trigger and an effect. The table
doesn't do all of the work for you, but it does generate a
concept. You can then flesh out the idea by deciding what
the exact details of the trigger and effect are, how they
work together, and how they fit into the space where they’re
found. You can use these tables to generate a trap on the fly,
but they function best when you have time to consider all the
possibilities and ramifications. Create a few traps in advance
so that you have some options for just the right situation.

The table contains 50 unique triggers and 50 unique effects.
You can roll a d100 two times, using the first result to
determine your trigger, and the second to determine your
effect. You can also choose a combination of trigger and
effect from the table, or you can choose one half of the trap
and roll randomly for the other.

```
Unlikely Combinations
Generating traps is not without its idiosyncrasies. Every
combination of trigger and effect presented in this section can
work together, but some may require a little extra thought.
For example, consider a trap with a mundane trigger and a
magic effect, such as a pressure plate that teleports the target
to another location. The pressure plate could be in a narrow
hallway, with a portal disguised as a mirror. When the target
approaches to look into the mirror they step on the pressure
plate, which catapults them into the portal.
What about a magic trigger paired with a mundane effect?
The target draws their weapon in the trap’s range, making it
cast produce flame on a candle hidden in the ceiling. Just above
the candle is a thin rope, from which hangs a jug filled with
oil. Once the flame burns through the rope the jug falls to the
ground, shattering and releasing the oil. The still burning
rope tied to the jug ignites the oil and all creatures within a
20 foot radius are set ablaze.

Chapter Nine | Random Trap Generator 113

```
D T
Detecting a trigger of any kind usually requires a Wisdom
(Perception) check. Magic triggers can also be found with an
Intelligence (Arcana) check, but this doesn’t let a creature
sense the presence of magic. That’s what detect magic is
for. An Intelligence (Arcana) check represents a creature
recognizing some arcane symbols or recalling a piece of lore
about an object or area. Once discovered, an Intelligence
(Investigation) check can be used to conduct a thorough
examination of the trap trigger and deduce how to best to
disable it.
There may be times when it may seem more appropriate to
use a non-standard check, such as Dexterity (Perception) if
something requires a particularly deft touch.
```
```
PASSIVE CHECKS
Always be aware of a creature’s passive Perception (10 + the
creature’s Wisdom/Intelligence modifier + any bonuses, such
as proficiency) and compare it to the relevant DCs for any
trap they’re approaching. If a creature’s passive Perception
equals or exceeds the DC to detect the trigger, the creature
automatically detects it and can try to disable it.
Triggers with the difficult trait require an active Intelligence
(Investigation) check to understand how they work and how
they can be disabled.
Difficult. A trigger with this trait is more complex than
usual. Once a creature detects the trigger, they must make a
successful Intelligence (Investigation) check to understand
how it works. If the check fails, the creature cannot disable
the trigger because they do not understand what they have
found. A creature can attempt to understand a difficult trap
again after completing a long rest.
```
```
D T
Identifying a trigger is one thing, but disabling it is another.
Mundane triggers usually require a successful Dexterity
check using thieves’ tools, while disabling magic triggers
usually requires a successful Intelligence (Arcana) check or a
successful use of dispel magic. Ambiguous triggers can require
either option.
Most of the time, there’s no drawback to failing to disable
a trap, but if the trigger has the sensitive trait it could be
disastrous if the check is particularly low.
Sensitive. Failing to disable a sensitive trigger may result
in accidentally setting off the trap. Traps of setback and
moderate lethality are triggered on failed disable checks
totaling 5 or less. Dangerous , perilous , and deadly traps are
triggered on failed disable checks totaling 10 or less.
Sometimes triggers can be bypassed instead of disabled.
Using silence to get past a trap triggered by sound bypasses
the trap, but it hasn’t been disabled. If creatures make sound
near that trigger later on, without the protection of the spell,
the trap can still activate.
```
Triggers

The best way to be safe from any trap is to notice its trigger
and avoid it, which isn't always easy or even possible. No
trap should be both impossible to find and impossible to
avoid or mitigate. It may, however, be one or the other. If
it's easy to find, then it's fair to severely punish creatures
who don't find it by making the saving throw difficult or
not allowing one at all. If a trap is impossible to find or to
bypass, then there should be a way to mitigate or negate the
damage entirely.

Always think about triggers in specific, real-world terms,
not just dice rolls. You want to be able to describe in detail
what characters see or feel as they explore. Consider all the
senses. Sight and sound are common descriptors, but smell,
taste, and texture can help set the scene as well.

T T

Trap triggers come in three different forms: mundane,
ambiguous, and magic. Each kind of trigger says something
about the purpose of the trap and how best to use it.

MUNDANE TRIGGERS

Mundane triggers are triggers without a magic component.
They usually have some sort of mechanical apparatus  like
clockwork, gears, or water pressure  but they can also be as
simple as a floor tile that breaks away when enough weight
is applied.

AMBIGUOUS TRIGGERS

Ambiguous triggers could be mundane, magic, or a
combination of both. The Wrong Key trigger, for example,
might be a key of the wrong shape or size or it might be the
right shape key that hasn’t been enchanted properly. One
option is mundane while the other is magic.

MAGIC TRIGGERS

Magic triggers have far fewer limitations. They can be simple
or complex, but they often include a hint of mysticism. A
glyph that activates when a creature gets close enough is
the classic example. There could be a magic trip wire that
activates the trap or an _alarm_ spell that detects intruders and
then activates the trap.

Trigger Details
Detailed descriptions of each type of trigger are presented
below, along with suggestions regarding how the trigger
might best be used. Common countermeasures are also
provided. By no means are these the only possible options,
just the most common.
To make any of these triggers more challenging, you can add
the difficult or sensitive trait.
```
```
M T
These triggers are primarily mechanical and don’t have any
magical component. Gears, levers, weights, springs, or
other mechanical devices might be involved in the design
of the trigger.
Countermeasures. A successful Wisdom (Perception) check
reveals a mundane trigger and a successful Dexterity check
using thieves’ tools disables it. Mundane triggers that
operate differently have their countermeasures noted in
their descriptions.
```
```
ATTEMPT TO PICK LOCK
The trigger is built into a lock and attempting to pick it
triggers the trap. Using a key on the lock will not trigger the
trap. This is one of the most common triggers and is a useful
deterrent almost anywhere.
```
```
BREAK OBJECT
Breaking an object such as a glass case, crystal vial, or magic
gem triggers the trap.
```
```
FAIL TO PICK LOCK
Failing an attempt to pick a lock triggers the trap.
```
```
INTERACT WITH BAIT
An object that would pique interest has been placed out in
the open and interacting with it triggers the trap. This might
be a corpse or object out of its normal place. The object
may or may not show evidence of the trap’s nature, such as
being shot full of darts, or sliced cleanly in half. If the object
does have evidence like this it could be intended to deceive
potential victims.
Countermeasures. A successful Wisdom (Perception) check
reveals the trigger. A successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)
check allows a creature to interact with the bait without
activating the trigger, while a successful Dexterity check
made with thieves’ tools disables the trigger.
```
```
MAKE SOUND
Any sound above a certain level triggers the trap. Creatures
must make an effort to be stealthy, and some creatures may
not make enough sound to trigger the trap due to flying or
other forms of movement.
Countermeasures (Difficult). A successful Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the trigger. Creatures who move or
perform actions in the trapped area must make a successful
Dexterity (Stealth) check each round to avoid triggering the
trap. A successful Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals
the nature of the trigger, and allows a creature to attempt a
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools check to disable it.
Creative characters can use other ways of muffling sound,
like casting silence on a creature or area, to bypass this trigger.
```
```
MOVE LEVER/PRESS BUTTON
Moving a lever or pressing a button triggers the trap.
Depending on the trap, pressing the button or moving the
lever again might deactivate the trap once triggered.
```
**WHAT DOES THIS DO?**

```
Multiple levers or buttons quickly turns a simple trap
into a complex one. A natural instinct is to test each
lever to assess what they all do and how to deal with the
trap. Consider ensuring that there are clues in the area
of the trap, or make sure characters have a chance to
learn about the trap prior to encountering it.
```

Chapter Nine | Random Trap Generator 115

OPEN/CLOSE DOOR

Opening or closing a door triggers the trap. Locating these
types of triggers is often difficult because the mechanism
can be completely hidden on the other side of the door or
part of the door itself. Note that this trigger is not something
attached to the door; that would be a Tension Cable trigger.

**_Countermeasures (Difficult)._** A successful Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the trigger. A successful
Intelligence (Investigation) check while examining the door
reveals the nature of the trigger, and allows a creature to
attempt a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to disable it.

Sawing, burning, or smashing a hole through the door
without letting it swing open could bypass this trigger. Using
a ranged spell to blow the door off the hinges could also
allow creatures to trigger the trap while avoiding its effects.

OPEN/CLOSE CHEST

Opening or closing a chest triggers the trap. Locating this
type of trigger is often difficult because the mechanism can
be completely hidden within the chest, or part of one or
more of the chest’s components. Note that this trigger is not
something attached to the chest; that would be a Tension
Cable trigger.

OPEN/CLOSE OBJECT

Opening or closing an object may flip a hidden switch, make
gears mesh, or act as a mundane trigger in any number of
other ways. If an object can be opened or closed  whether
with a door, shutter, stopper, or anything else  then it can
be trapped. Objects such as a cabinet, a drawer, or book, an
oil lamp with a door, or a mechanical eye could all be good
candidates for this trigger.

PICK LOCK

Picking a lock triggers the trap. This may include attempting
to subvert the lock in a way that does not involve using the
correct key.

**_Countermeasures (Difficult)._** A successful Wisdom
(Perception) check lets a creature detect the trigger, and a
successful Intelligence (Investigate) check lets it understand
the trigger. The trigger can be disabled by successfully
picking the lock with a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools
that exceeds the lock DC by 5 or more.

PICK UP/SHIFT OBJECT

Picking up or moving an object triggers the trap. The trap
could be hidden behind an object or it could be resting on a
pressure plate that triggers the trap.

```
Countermeasures. A successful Wisdom (Perception) check
reveals the trigger, and a successful Dexterity check using
thieves’ tools disables it.
To bypass the trigger, a creature can attempt to replace the
object with one of equal weight. The creature must make
a successful Intelligence (Perception) check to accurately
estimate the weight of the object and a successful Dexterity
(Sleight of Hand) check to switch the objects. Failure on
either roll activates the trap.
```
```
PRESSURE PLATE
Applying weight to the pressure plate triggers the trap.
It's possible to avoid the plate by simply jumping over it or
putting something across it. The pressure plate could be set
into a wall and triggered when someone leans against it or
places a steadying hand on it. It could also be at a spot that's
hard to search or to avoid, such as on the far side of a 15-foot
chasm that creatures are likely to leap across.
Some pressure plates activate only after they have been
depressed and then released. Hopefully, a creature that steps
onto the plate has companions who can figure out a way to
deactivate the trap or negate its effects.
```
```
PRODUCE FLAME
The presence of flame triggers the trap. Usually this is due to
light or heat sensitive mold or fungi in range of the trigger.
Bait is important with this kind of trigger. Something such
as faint writing etched into the wall of a dark room or cave
entices creatures to bring the flame closer.
Countermeasures. A successful Wisdom (Perception) check
reveals that a nearby surface is reacting to the presence of
the flame. A successful Intelligence (Nature) check disables
the trigger.
```
```
PULL ROPE/CHAIN
Pulling on a rope, chain, or hanging line of some sort triggers
the trap. This could be a rope or chain a creature needs to
climb or slide down. It might even be a rope tossed around a
rock or other handy projection with the trigger built in.
A rope or chain hanging from an upper level is the perfect
opportunity to tie a jug of something nasty to the other end.
When pulled, the jug comes down and explodes in tar, fire,
poisonous gas, or some other horrible thing.
Countermeasures. A successful Wisdom (Perception) check
reveals the trigger, and a successful Dexterity (Sleight of
Hand) check disables it.
```
```
REMOVE BARRIER
Removal of a barrier triggers the trap. Barriers can be as
large as a portcullis or as small as a drain stopper. This
trigger could be a stone in the ceiling, wall, or floor that
when removed allows water, sand, oil, or some other
material into a chamber.
```

116 Chapter Nine | Random Trap Generator

**TOO VALUABLE TO LEAVE**

```
The characters find a wondrous crystal orb set onto a
pedestal in the middle of the room. It’s purpose isn’t
immediately apparent, but they know it has to be
valuable. They don’t detect any curse on it so someone
picks it up. Within moments, a tube blocked by the orb
begins spewing a black, poisonous vapor into the room.
```
```
TAPPING/PRODDING
Applying pressure to a specific spot via tapping or prodding
triggers the trap. Rapping on walls or tapping on the floor
with a pole are such common methods for finding traps and
secret doors that trap builders often take advantage of them.
Countermeasures. A successful Wisdom (Perception) check
reveals the trigger. A successful Dexterity (Sleight of Hand)
check allows a creature to tap or prod without activating
the trigger, while a successful Dexterity check made with
thieves’ tools disables it.
```
```
TENSION CABLE
A wire, rope, or other line connects an object to the trap. The
trap triggers when the tension cable is pulled or goes slack.
```
```
TRIPWIRE
A wire, rope, or other line is strung across a high traffic area.
Breaking or sufficiently disturbing the line triggers the trap.
Often used for traps with external mechanisms, the wire can
also be connected to a complicated network of components
hidden in a wall or removed area.
```
```
TURN WHEEL/CRANK
Turning a wheel or crank in a certain direction, or turning it
to or past a certain point, triggers the trap. A wheel or crank
is usually used with opening or closing something, raising
or lowering gates, drawbridges, or powering some other
mechanical tasks. Accompanying their normal function
with a trap trigger turns a seemingly innocuous device into a
potentially deadly encounter.
```
**TRAPPED LIKE RATS!**

```
The characters find a heavy portcullis blocking their
way. None of them can lift it, but they do find a crank
mechanism to raise it. The strongest among them
spends several minutes raising the portcullis, then uses
a latch built into the crank to lock it. The characters
move onward, but a few minutes later they hear a loud
thud as the portcullis comes crashing back down. What
they didn’t realize is that the crank also wound a timed
release on the latch and now they are trapped on the
other side of the portcullis.
```
```
WEIGHT SENSITIVE SURFACE
Placing or removing weight on the surface triggers the trap.
A weight sensitive surface is a more sensitive version of a
pressure plate, and is often used in larger applications. The
surface could be a 5-foot by 5-foot square on the floor, or the
floor’s entire area.
```
```
A T
These triggers can be magical or not, depending on the
situation. A book with a needle hidden in the spine that is
on a spring-loaded release is a mundane combination of the
Open/Close trigger and a Needle effect.
However, if the book was enchanted to trigger when opened,
that would be a magical version of the Open/Close trigger.
```
```
COUNTERMEASURES
Unless noted otherwise, If a trigger is mundane, a successful
Wisdom (Perception) check reveals it, and a successful
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables it.
If a trigger is magic, a successful Wisdom (Perception)
check, Intelligence (Arcana) check, or detect magic reveals it. A
successful Intelligence (Arcana) check or dispel magic disables
the trigger.
A magic version of an ambiguous trigger is usually the
equivalent of a 3rd level abjuration spell for interactions
with detect magic and dispel magic.
```
```
ACTIVATE LIGHT FIXTURE
Lighting or dousing a light fixture triggers the trap. A wall
sconce with a torch or a lantern is hard for a creature with no
darkvision to resist. This could also be an orb with a continual
flame spell, activated by touch or a command word.
```
```
DISTURB LIQUID
A pool or fountain can be dangerous for any number
of reasons: filled with poisonous liquid, the home of a
dangerous creature, the trigger for a trap. This trigger can be
effective on a pool or basin with gems or valuable items at
the bottom. Some trivial amount of disturbance might still
be safe; a creature might be able to remove items from the
pool as long as they don’t make too many ripples.
```
```
FALSE TRIGGER
Some other trigger left out in the open, such as an undisguised
pressure plate, can be the perfect bait. Physically or magically
interacting with this false trigger is what actually sets off the
trap. A creature may get clues to the nature of the true trigger
while attempting to disable the false one.
```

MUSICAL/AUDITORY

Making a particular sound, or the absence of a sound,
triggers the trap. The trigger could be tied entirely to a
musical instrument and activated if the object is played in
a specific area. Or the trigger could be activated by failing
to play the instrument. Other sounds, like speaking or
smashing rocks together, could also be triggers.

**_Countermeasures._** If mundane, a successful Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the trigger and a successful
Intelligence (History) check gives insight to the required
sound. If magic, a successful Wisdom (Perception) check,
Intelligence (Arcana) check, or casting _detect magic_ reveals
the nature of the trigger. A successful Intelligence (Arcana)
check or _dispel magic_ disables it.

OPEN/CLOSE BOOK

Opening or closing a particular book triggers the trap.
A creature examining a massive tome on a pedestal or
opening a dusty old book they found on a bookshelf can
activate this trigger.

REMOVE OBJECT

Removing a particular object from a certain area triggers the
trap. This can be as specific as removing a gem from its ring
or as broad as removing a treasure horde from a dungeon.

STEP INTO LIGHT/DARKNESS

Moving from light into darkness, darkness into light,
breaking a beam of light, casting a shadow onto a particular
surface, or standing between a light source and an object
triggers the trap.

**_Countermeasures._** If mundane, a successful Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the trigger and a successful
Dexterity (Acrobatics or Stealth) check bypasses it. If magical,
a successful Wisdom (Perception), Intelligence (Arcana)
check, or casting _detect magic_ reveals the trigger. A successful
Intelligence (Arcana) check or _dispel magic_ disables it.

Depending on the nature of the trigger, spells like _daylight_
or _darkness_ could also serve to disable either a magical or
mundane version.

TOUCH OBJECT

Touching a particular object triggers the trap. There may
be parameters that determine who or what may or may not
touch the object. These criteria can be as broad or specific as
necessary, including race, alignment, gender, spellcasting
ability, religious affiliation, or class. Wearing gloves or using
something else to touch the object might bypass the trigger
instead of disabling it.

```
USE WRONG KEY
Using an incorrect key triggers the trap. Turn the key the
wrong way, clockwise instead of counter-clockwise, could
also trigger this trap.
```
```
WRONG COMBINATION
Combinations can be used for almost anything. They can lock
doors or chests, lower bridges, activate portals. Inputs could
be nearly anything as well, such as pulling on chains, ropes,
levers, pushing buttons, using particular spell components
in a certain order, spelling a word backward, or even doing
dance steps. The important thing is to consider what correct
combination the trap engineer decided on, why they decided
on that combination, and why they determined that someone
should be seriously penalized for getting it wrong.
In the event that someone who knows the combination
is held hostage and forced to enter it, entering the wrong
combination might give them the upper hand. If the trap’s
effect targets the creature entering the combination, the
hostage could position themselves in such a way as to avoid
the attack, harm their captors and attempt an escape.
```
**COMBO-PUZZLES**

```
When it comes to solving combination
puzzles,characters should never be faced with a
combination that they could not know by the time they
reach it. You could place hints along the way, hide the
combination in the room, or use an NPC to tell them
the answer cryptically, etc. Just remember that barring
progress with a combination that the characters have
no way of knowing is frustrating. Arbitrarily pushing
buttons or pulling ropes isn’t fun, especially if the
characters are being punished with traps for each
failure.
```

118 Chapter Nine | Random Trap Generator

```
ACTIVATE RUNE
A rune of detection can be activated by simple proximity or it
can have more nuanced activation criteria. The rune may be
invisible or out in the open. What the rune does may or may
not be readily apparent; it may even be beneficial. Whatever
effect it has, activating the rune still triggers the trap.
Countermeasures. A rune of detection can be found with
a successful Wisdom (Perception) check or with detect
magic. Once found, it can be disabled with dispel magic or a
successful Intelligence (Arcana) check.
```
```
BRING OBJECT
Bringing a specific object or type of object to or past a
certain point or area triggers the trap. The object could be
something found in the same area as the trap, or something
that was brought from further away. This trigger could also
be a broad enchantment that triggers if a type of item enters
the area such as a weapon, or a set of thieves’ tools.
```
```
CAST SPELL
Casting a spell triggers the trap. The trigger may require a
specific spell, or any spell from a specific school of magic, or
any spell at all. This type of trigger is especially effective in
areas or chambers where creatures are likely to be attacked
and will cast spells during combat.
```
```
COMMAND WORD
Using anything that requires a command word triggers the
trap. Creatures can use magic weapons, armor, potions,
scrolls, and similar items that don't rely on command words
with no risk, unless those items have extra powers that are
triggered on command.
```
```
CORPSE
Bringing a corpse into an area triggers the trap. The trigger
might only activate if the corpse is of a creature from a
specific race or type.
```
```
CREATURE DETECTOR
A creature of a certain type or with certain qualities entering
the detector’s range triggers the trap. Such qualities can
include type, race, class, alignment, age, or gender. This is
especially useful for organizations made up of a particular
race and alignment, such as a cult of evil elves. They might
set up the trigger to activate if it detects a creature of any
other race and alignment.
```
```
DETECT MAGIC
The presence of an active detect magic spell within a certain
area, whether cast in that area or active already, triggers the
trap. This is a good trigger to combine with other triggers,
especially in an area where detect magic would usually see use,
like a treasure vault. Note that detect magic will reveal this
trigger, but it will also set off the trap.
```
```
M T
Something that couldn’t be achieved by a mechanical
process, such as determining when a creature of a specific
race enters a room, is probably a magic trigger. Magic
triggers are often glyphs or runes of some kind, scribed
onto the surface of a wall or object near the trapped area.
They can also be crystals, orbs, plants, suits of armor, or
something easy to hide in the area. When creating a trap
with a magic trigger, it’s usually better to have some object
or glyph as the trigger since that gives a fixed point for
determining range and other parameters of the effect.
Unless otherwise noted, a successful Wisdom (Perception)
check or casting detect magic reveals a magic trigger. Magic
triggers can also be found with an Intelligence (Arcana)
check, but this represents a creature recognizing an object or
area from their knowledge of magic; it’s not a replacement
for detect magic. A successful Intelligence (Arcana) check or a
successful dispel magic cast on the trigger disables it.
Detect Magic. Finding magic traps with detect magic is usually
pretty straightforward, but the spell doesn’t reveal the
nature of the trigger or what countermeasures might be
necessary. Detect magic can also be blocked by 1 foot of stone,
1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of
wood or dirt. In most cases, triggers are abjuration effects.
Dispel Magic. Magic traps of 3rd level or lower are
automatically disabled by detect magic. For magic triggers of
4th level or higher, the DC required is 10 + the spell’s level
(or the trigger’s spell level equivalent).
The table below shows recommended spell levels for magic
traps based on character level and trap lethality. You can use
this table to determine the spell level of the trigger for detect
magic and it’s DC for dispel magic.

Chapter Nine | Random Trap Generator 119

DRAW WEAPON

Unsheathing a weapon within a specified area triggers the
trap. Carrying the specific weapon out and ready for use into
the area can also trigger the trap. Drawing the weapon out of
an object (anvil, stone, block of wood, etc.) or removing it from
being submerged in something could also trigger the trap.

FAIL TO SPEAK PASSWORD

Failure to speak a certain password within a predetermined
amount of time triggers the trap. Another trap trigger
such as a pressure plate, tripwire, lever, or button might
be rendered safe by uttering a special word or phrase. The
trigger could be deactivated only for a short time or only
for the person who said the password. The password can
be hidden somewhere in the room, revealed by a puzzle, or
hinted at in legends or rumors.

INSULT IDOL

Doing something that would be insulting or distasteful to a
deity or otherworldly being while in the presence of an effigy
or representation of it triggers the trap. Desecrating an idol or
blaspheming against a deity in its shrine might trigger a trap.
Ignoring an idol or failing to present an offering may also be
considered an insult and trigger the trap.

**_Countermeasures._** A successful Wisdom (Perception) check,
Intelligence (Arcana) or (Religion) check, or casting _detect
magic_ reveals the nature of the trigger. Another successful
Intelligence (Arcana) check or a successful _dispel magic_ cast on
the idol disables it.

Performing specific rites or obeisances can bypass the trap
as well.

LOOK INTO

Looking into an object, opening, or material triggers the
trap. A magic mirror could trap the viewer or swap them
for an evil twin. Looking into a pool of water could cause
a creature to become charmed. A creature looking into the
eyes of a portrait or the jeweled eyes of a statue could be
possessed or charmed. Alternatively, simply seeing the
reflection of a rune or glyph in a mirror may be enough to
trigger a trap.

MORTAL SACRIFICE

Killing a creature in a specific area or way triggers the trap.
Alternatively, sacrificing the wrong creature, or performing
the sacrifice incorrectly, triggers the trap.

**_Countermeasures._** A successful Wisdom (Perception)
check, Intelligence (Arcana, History, or Religion) check, or
casting _detect magic_ reveals the nature of the trigger. Another
successful Intelligence (Arcana) check or a successful _dispel
magic_ cast on the trigger disables it.

**THE OL’ SWITCHEROO**

```
The wizard was invisible and down to his last spell.
After the rest of his companions had been killed and
their bodies thrown into the basilisk pit, the cultists
resumed the ritual. What the high priest had failed to
notice was that his precious snake-tooth dagger was
not the genuine article. In the commotion, the wizard
had swiped it with mage hand, replacing the real dagger
with a simple one enhanced by an illusion. The priest
raised the dagger over his head as the ritual reached
its climax, then plunged it into the heart of his victim.
Suddenly the room began to shake. For a moment the
cultists thought they had succeeded in summoning the
great serpent from his slumber, but as the ceiling began
to collapse, the priest knew that something was terribly
wrong. The cultists tried to run, but a massive stone fell
and blocked their escape. The wizard dodged boulder
after boulder and just as there was nowhere left to go, he
cast teleport to make his escape.
```
```
OFFERING
Placing an offering in a vessel triggers the trap.
Alternatively, the trigger may be activated if the wrong
offering is given, if no offering is given, or if existing
offerings are taken from the vessel. Vessels may be plates,
vases, wishing wells, fountains, bowls, baskets or any other
container capable of receiving items.
Offerings are typically coins, precious metals, gems, magic
items or anything of value, though the specifics of what is
needed can vary greatly and could certainly be odd, strange,
or even humorous. Offerings can also be ephemeral things
like a memory or a story instead of physical objects.
Countermeasures. A successful Wisdom (Perception) check or
Intelligence (Religion) check reveals the nature of the trigger.
A successful dispel magic cast on the trigger disables it.
Giving the correct offering or leaving existing offerings as
they are bypasses the trap.
```

120 Chapter Nine | Random Trap Generator

```
PASS AREA
Moving into or through an area triggers the trap. This could
be triggered by anyone, or only by creatures that meet
certain criteria (such as “good-aligned creatures,” “elves,” or
“anyone who isn’t a goblin”).
```
**DO NOT PASS THE SEAL**

```
The characters enter a large room with multiple exits on
the near side and a beautifully decorated dragon shrine
on the far side. On the floor, in the exact center of the
room, is a beautiful mosaic seal of a dragon with ruby
eyes and outstretched wings. Referring to his books,
the wizard finds a passage about the shrine. “Only the
worthy may approach.” he reads. Hearing this, the
paladin, self-righteous and bombastic, strides forward
across the seal to approach the shrine. Suddenly, the
entire room begins to shake and rumble. The wizard
turns to the fighter, saying “he is not worthy...”
```
```
PASS THRESHOLD
Crossing the threshold of a door, entryway, exit, or archway
triggers the trap. The trigger could be part of the doorway
itself, of just part of the transition from one area to another.
```
**THE GUARDS ARE DEAD**

```
A powerful necromancer has filled his labyrinth with
undead minions, and set alarm traps at every major
junction. The characters watch the undead minions
pass through the main corridor and formulate a plan.
Waiting for the most opportune moment, they spring
into action, making a break for it through the main
corridor. To their dismay they immediately set off a
series of bells, chimes, and gongs. Wave after wave of
undead minions attack the puzzled group, who had no
idea that the necromancer’s traps were set to only detect
living creatures.
```
```
PRODUCE LIGHT/DARKNESS
Creating light or darkness within a certain area triggers the
trap. Magical or non-magical means of creating light or
darkness can both trigger the trap.
```
```
READ WRITING
When a creature reads aloud certain writing it triggers the
trap. The writing may be in a book or scroll, carved above a
doorway, or etched into the blade of a sword.
```
```
SPEAK TRIGGER WORD
Uttering a particular word or phrase in the area triggers
the trap. The trigger word or phrase might be something
common that creatures are likely to speak without
prompting, or it could be found on a nearby surface in an
attempt to trick them into saying it aloud.
A successful Wisdom (Insight) check or Intelligence
(Investigation) check reveals any clues in the area or helps
creatures to deduce what the trigger word might be.
```
```
SPILL BLOOD
The spilling of blood within the area triggers the trap.
Alternatively, the enchantment could be placed on a weapon
or powerful artifact that the characters will use in combat.
This trigger is especially effective when used in an area
where a fight is likely to break out. It also fits as a deterrent
if used in a place focused on peace, where the overseers
might openly inform guests as to what will happen (or
perhaps just that something will happen) if blood is spilled.
```
```
UNCONSCIOUSNESS
A creature being unconscious in a particular area triggers
the trap. This area can be a single room, a collection of
rooms, or an entire dungeon.

Effects

These are the parts of the trap that eviscerate, immolate,
maim, poison, puncture and otherwise really mess up
creatures. That is, unless they find ways to avoid them.

Effects can be used in many clever ways. Consider placing
an effect so that it targets someone other than the creature
who triggered the trap. Whether it's a pit that opens 15 feet
behind a pressure plate or a flame jet that engulfs every
portion of a room except the 5-foot space containing a chest,
shifting the effect away from the trigger provides a nasty

```
surprise and makes some countermeasures less effective or
even more dangerous.
Effects can be magic or mundane, depending on what works
best for the trap and the nature of the effect. A Ring of
Flame effect may be a flammable liquid, or it could be a wall
of flame spell. A set of spears thrusting out from the passage
wall could be as simple as it sounds, or they could be an
illusion that deals psychic damage. Always think about the
setting and what fits your campaign.

For trap effects that deal damage, use the tables below to determine the outcome based on character level and trap severity.
This damage may be dealt in one round, or it may be dealt over multiple rounds.

Not all traps use a d10 damage die; that’s just a baseline average for how much damage the effect should deal. For example,
if several darts shoot at a level 10 character, and the trap is dangerous, the attack should deal around 49 damage on average.
This means if each dart is dealing 1d4 damage, there will be around 20 darts involved in this one trap.

TRAP ATTACK BONUS AND SAVE DC

Use these values if the trap is making attack rolls against creatures or for any ability checks or saving throws the trap requires.

Chapter Nine | Random Trap Generator 123

Effect Details

Detailed descriptions of each type of effect (mundane,
ambiguous, and magic) are provided below. Each effect
is presented with a description of how it is intended to
function and some suggestions for how the effect might best
be used. The effect’s mechanics are listed, explaining how
the trap affects creatures.

Many of these effects refer to creatures within the trap’s area
or within range of the trap. A trap’s specific range or area of
effect is up to you, but should be mostly determined by its
location and severity. A trap in a 20-foot square room that is
only a setback might just target 1 creature or 1 5-foot square;
if the trap is perilous it might affect the entire room.

S T

Some ambiguous effects and most magic effects presented
below could be a _symbol_ spell or a spell trap version of _glyph of
warding_ , each of which have specific rules for how its effects
resolve. These rules supercede the general rules for trap
effects. A trap effect that could be a _glyph of warding_ or _symbol_
is designated with the **spell trap** trait.

Spell traps have a more fixed severity than other effects, due
to the level of the stored spell. A spell trap storing _prismatic
spray_ is always going to be at least 7th level spell slot, making
at minimum a perilous trap for 13th-16th level characters.
To allow for more flexibility, we’ve provided two versions of
effects with the spell trap trait; one that is a _glyph of warding
(spell trap)_ and one that isn’t. You can use whichever version
best suits your needs.

M E

Similar to their trigger counterparts, mundane effects are
primarily mechanical or, at the very least, lacking any magical
component. Any locomotion is due to machinery, gravity, or
naturally generated exertion (such as a goblin riding a bicycle
in order to power a rotating pinwheel of death).

BARRIER

A barrier can be a portcullis, a stone slab, wooden timbers,
or other device designed to block a passageway. A barrier can
also be placed cleverly as a way to split up groups of creatures.

**_Effect._** Once triggered, any creatures in the path of the
barrier must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature that
fails takes full damage from the trap (usually bludgeoning),
or only half damage on a success.

Possible ways to get past the barrier might include a
successful Strength (Athletics) check to lift or catch the
barrier or a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check to
determine how or if it can be dismantled.

```
BOLTS
A hidden crossbow, or an array of crossbows, is set to fire
when the trigger is activated. Usually they are carefully hidden
behind a wall, on the ceiling, or otherwise hidden out of sight.
Effect. The trap makes one attack roll against a creature in
range for each bolt set to fire. The number of bolts should be
enough to deal the trap’s damage based on its severity, and
each bolt deals piercing damage.
Combining this effect with another can produce a trap with
flaming bolts that deal additional fire or acid damage.
```
```
CAGE
A wooden or metal cage drops down onto creatures in the
area, or in some cases walls suddenly spring up from the floor.
Alternatively, creatures could fall into a locking chest or box.
Effect. Creatures in the area of the trap must succeed on
a Dexterity saving throw or be trapped in the cage. If the
cage is merely heavy but has no floor, a successful Strength
(Athletics) check will lift it.
If the cage is locked, a successful Dexterity check while using
thieves’ tools will unlock it.
```
```
CRUSHING CEILING/WALLS
The ceiling or walls are designed to slowly crush creatures
to death. Once the surfaces reach a creature’s space, they
start to take damage. This effect can be used in most indoor
spaces, such as rooms or corridors, and often includes a
barrier to prevent escape.
The trap’s speed is variable; at the speed listed below, it takes
1 minute (10 rounds) to move 10 feet. If the ceiling starts
at 10 feet up, it will reach most Medium creatures within 5
rounds. If you decide to alter the speed, make sure that the
characters have time to attempt to stop or avoid the walls.
This effect also works wondrously in terms of dramatic
tension. The walls are a natural countdown, and combining
this with descriptions of sounds as the space closes can be
incredibly engaging.
Effect. The moving surfaces move at a rate of 1 foot per
round at the end of the initiative order. Once the surface
reaches a creature’s space, they take 1d10 bludgeoning
damage. If the surface is still moving on the next turn, the
creature is restrained and takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage.
A third round spent being crushed inflicts 4d10 bludgeoning
damage, the fourth and every round thereafter inflicts 10d10
bludgeoning damage until the surface retracts.
Most traps of this kind are designed to retract once they
reach the opposite wall or floor.
```

124 Chapter Nine | Random Trap Generator

```
DARTS
Darts shoot out of the walls, floor, or ceiling at a nearby
area. The darts may be smeared with some sort of poison or
enchanted in some way.
Effect. Each creature in the trap’s area must make a Dexterity
saving throw. A creature that fails takes full piercing damage
from the trap, or half as much on a succes.
If the darts are poisoned, creatures that fail their Dexterity
saving throw must make a Constitution saving throw or be
poisoned for 1 minute.

Creatures drop into a deep pit with sheer sides dug into the
ground or floor. The pit could be empty, spiked, filled with
water, an entry to lower floor or area, or the lair of a monster.
Effect. Creatures standing over the drop when the trap
is triggered must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
successful save, a creature is able to grab onto the edge of
the pit. On a failed save, a creature falls into the pit and takes
bludgeoning damage from the fall. Climbing out of a pit
usually takes a successful Strength (Athletics) check.
```
```
Drops are like pastries; they come in many shapes, sizes,
and fillings. A big open pit is easy to spot, but stepping on
a pressure plate that causes the floor to collapse is hard
to avoid. Concealing a pit with a tarp, trapdoor, debris, or
magical illusion is also highly effective.
What happens once a creature reaches the bottom of a
drop depends on how far they fell. Most drops deal 1d6
bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen (maximum 20d6). If
creatures fall into water or if they drop into a slanted chute
that slows their fall they might take half the damage or
reduce the effective fall distance.
Remember that creatures always land prone when they
fall, unless they have a way to negate the damage from the
fall. That could be from a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity
(Acrobatics) check against the trap effect’s DC, although that
might not be possible for all drops.
For a drop with more variety, roll a d10 and consult the
table below. Except for the Drop Into Teleporter version,
these drops can be either magic or mundane. The maximum
damage of this drop is determined by the trap’s lethality,
which also sets the maximum depth of the drop.
```
```
d10
Type of
Drop
Effect
```
```
1 Empty Creatures take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet they fall.
2 Spiked Creatures take 1d6 damage for every 10 feet they fall; half of this damage is bludgeoning and half is piercing.
```
```
3 Into water
```
```
Creatures take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet they fall after the first 20 feet. A creature in the
water can keep it’s head clear for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution score. After that time,
the creature starts to suffocate.
```
```
4 Into lower
level
```
```
Creatures take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet they fall, or half that damage if the fall ends in
a ramp or slide to ease the landing. The creatures are now in a deeper area or a lower floor than they were
previously on.
```
```
5 Into lair
Creatures take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet they fall, or half that damage if the fall ends in
a ramp or slide to ease the landing. The creatures are now in the lair of a monster.
```
```
6 Acid
```
```
Creatures take 1d6 damage for every 10 feet they fall; half of this damage is bludgeoning and half is acid.
For a more challenging drop, the acid can corrode metal. Any nonmagical weapon or armor that is made
of metal that a character is wearing or holding that touches the acid begins to corrode. At the start of
each turn in the pit, the following occurs: A weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to
damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of
metal that touches the acid is destroyed after dealing damage. Armour or shields take a permanent and
cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armour reduced to an AC of 10 or a shield that drops to a +0
bonus is destroyed.
7 Fire Creatures take 1d6 damage for every 10 feet they fall; half of this damage is bludgeoning and half is fire.
8 Hidden The trap’s trigger gains the difficult trait.
```
```
9 Locking
```
```
Creatures take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet they fall. After a creature falls into the pit, the
cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside. A successful Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open.
The cover can also be smashed open. A creature in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring
mechanism from the inside with a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, provided that the mechanism is
in its reach and the creature can see it.
```
```
10 Teleporting
```
```
Creatures that fall into the pit are teleported to another location of the trap designer’s choosing.
Depending on how the trap is arranged, a creature could take damage from a fall when they arrive in the
new location.
```

**DOUBLE SURPRISE**

```
The rogue returned from her scouting mission to report
that three rooms ahead there was a small group of
goblins on guard duty within a large chamber. They
shouldn’t put up much resistance, so the barbarian ran
in swinging, followed by the fighter and the bard, but the
rogue and wizard held back to guard the corridor. The
barbarian’s heroic slaughter was cut short when the first
goblin head was sliced clean off and the floor suddenly
fell out from under their feet. The three heroes along
with the remaining goblins fell thirty feet down into a
pit with a dirt floor littered with bones, broken weapons,
and shredded armor. The rogue and wizard stood helpless
at the doorway, looking down into the pit. A low pitched
rumble turned into a roar as their companions regained
their footing and prepared for a real fight.
```
FALLING OBJECTS

Objects are positioned in a high place, ready to fall on
a creature that triggers the trap. The ceiling or columns
holding up the ceiling collapse and send heavy bricks or
stone pieces falling to the floor. This effect is especially
powerful as part of the final encounter in a dungeon, adding
to the drama and tension of the scene.

**_Effect._** Creatures in the area of the trap must make a
Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails takes full
bludgeoning damage from the trap, or half as much on a
success. Multiple saving throws may be necessary depending
on the size of the area and how far creatures must move to
get to safety.

FALLING/TIPPING VESSEL

A falling or tipping vessel might be a jug, bowl, or barrel.
Inside might be a combustible substance like oil or high-
proof alcohol, or something immediately harmful such as
burning acid or a poisonous powder.

**_Effect._** The contents of the vessel are emptied onto a creature or
into an area. Avoiding a falling object and its contents always
requires a successful Dexterity saving throw. Dealing with the
vessel’s contents depends on the nature of what’s inside.

Splashing liquids can reach nearby creatures, who can avoid
being splashed with a successful Dexterity saving throw.
Fine powders create a cloud which lingers in the area for a
time, which can create a lightly or heavily obscured area. If
the powder is poisonous, creatures in the area must make a
Constitution saving. A creature that fails takes full poison
damage from the trap, or half as much on a success.

```
Small objects such as ball-bearings or caltrops scatter and
remain on the ground after hitting their initial target. Ball-
bearings usually cover a level, square area that is 10 feet
on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must
succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A
creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need
to make the save.
Caltrops usually cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side.
Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15
Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1
piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s
walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1
hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed
doesn’t need to make the save.
A vessel could be caught to prevent it’s contents from
spilling. To catch the vessel, a creature (typically the one who
triggered the trap) must make a successful Dexterity save or
a successful Strength (Athletics) check.
```
```
FALLING SAND
Sand or gravel pours into a small area. Unless the space is
extremely small, or the volume of sand is massive, this trap
takes five or more rounds to complete.
Effect. Creatures in the area must make successful Dexterity
saving throws at the beginning of their turns to stay atop the
sand. The save DC starts at the base DC for the trap’s severity
and increases by 2 at the end of each round.
A creature that fails one saving throw is buried up to their
knees and restrained. On their next saving throw, if the
creature succeeds they dig themselves out and are no longer
restrained; if they fail they are buried waist-deep and
remain restrained.
A creature buried waist-deep must make a Strength saving
throw at the beginning of their turn; if they succeed they dig
themselves free of the sand and if they fail they are buried to
the neck and immobilized. On their next turn, the creature is
completely buried and starts suffocating.
As an action, a creature can dig out another creature with
a successful Strength (Athletics) check against the current
save DC of the trap. Spells like freedom of movement or
movement modes like burrow can also allow creatures to
freely move through the sand.
```

126 Chapter Nine | Random Trap Generator

```
Effect. The trap releases a net onto creatures in its area,
who must make Dexterity saving throws. A creature that
fails is trapped under the net and restrained, and creatures
that succeed avoid the net. A creature restrained by the net
can use its action to make a Strength check, freeing itself or
another creature within its reach on a success.
The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing
damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section of
it, freeing any creature trapped in that section. If the net has
harmful elements worked into it (blades, barbs, etc) a creature
takes half damage from the trap on a failed Strength check to
free itself, or no damage on a successful one.
```
```
RELEASE CREATURES
When the trap is triggered, it releases a creature from a cage
or from another chamber. Usually this kind of trap releases
a vicious beast ready to attack. However, this could release a
captive for the characters to slay so the captor doesn’t have
to. This could be for convenience, or as an insidious trick.
Effect. The trap releases one or more creatures into the area
and they act according to their nature and disposition. See
the Creatures table above for suggestions on how many
creatures the trap can release and what CR they should be.
If the creatures live in the trapped area, they generally won’t
leave it and just attack intruders. But if the creatures were
imprisoned, they might be more focused on escape.
```
```
ROLLING BOULDER
A massive boulder rolls toward creatures in the area,
crushing any who don’t move fast enough. Where the
boulder starts and how fast it moves determines how much
time creatures have to outrun the boulder. An effective use
of this trap is if the boulder is easy to outrun but another
danger lies ahead, like deep chasm. A rolling boulder coming
from behind is a good way to force creatures to run blindly
into unexplored hallways where more dangers await.
Effect. When the trap is activated, all creatures present roll
initiative as the sphere is released. The sphere rolls initiative
with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line.
The sphere can move through creatures’ spaces, and creatures
can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain.
Whenever the sphere enters a creature’s space or a creature
enters its space while it’s rolling, that creature must succeed
on a Dexterity saving throw or take bludgeoning damage
and be knocked prone. The sphere stops when it hits a wall
or similar barrier. It can’t go around corners, but smart
dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into
nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.
As an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can
attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a
successful check, the sphere’s speed is reduced by 15 feet.
If the sphere’s speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no
longer a threat.
```
```
IMPALING SPIKES
A surface such as a ceiling or wall is covered in spikes and
moves until it reaches another surface, impaling creatures
caught in the middle. The trap’s speed is variable and the
space between the spikes and opposite wall determines the
time available for creatures to react to the trap.
The spikes stick 5 feet out from the wall, so remember
to give characters time to avoid or stop the spikes. If the
space is a 10-foot room, and the spikes occupy 5 feet of
that, the characters would start off in immediate danger. If
spikes mounted on a ceiling are smooth, when they retract
creatures could slide off and take falling damage as normal.
Effect. The impaling spikes move at a rate of 1 foot per round,
always at the end of the initiative order. They keep moving
until the spikes touch the opposite surface, at which point
they retract. When the spikes enter a creature’s space, it must
make a Dexterity saving throw. If the creature succeeds they
take half damage from the trap, otherwise the creature takes
the trap’s full damage and is restrained by being impaled on
the spikes. Spikes generally deal piercing damage but they
could be coated with poison or enchanted as well.
A creature impaled by spikes can free themselves with a
Constitution (Athletics) check but not until there is room
equivalent to their size available in front of the spikes.
Another creature can free an impaled creature with a
successful Strength (Medicine) check, as long as there is
room. Once the spikes reach the opposite surface, they
retract and return to their starting point, releasing any
impaled creatures.
```
```
NEEDLE
Needles are often used in small mechanisms that require
the target to have bare hands to manipulate, such as locks or
clockwork devices.
Effect. Needles don’t do any damage on their own, so they
are usually coated in poison, requiring the triggering
creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure,
the creature takes full poison damage from the trap, or half
damage on a success. Needles can be hollow and deliver
some other kind of payload, or enchanted to deal fire or ice
damage instead of poison.
```
```
NET
A net falls on creatures, either from above or shot from a
wall. Most nets are made of hemp or silk rope, but some may
be made from much tougher materials such as braided rope,
chain, or even wire. Nets of rope can carry strong fumes that
could knock a creature out if it fails a Constitution saving
throw, leaving it waiting and vulnerable.
```

Chapter Nine | Random Trap Generator 127

SCYTHING BLADES

A single curved blade or multiple curved blades are
concealed in the walls, floor, or ceiling. When the trigger is
activated, the blades swing out to strike creatures.

**_Effect._** Each creature in the area makes a Dexterity saving
throw to evade the attack. Creatures take full slashing
damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful
one. On a failed save a creature is also restrained as they are
pinned against the opposite wall by the blades.

A creature restrained by the blades can free themselves with
a Constitution (Athletics) check or another creature can free
them with a Strength (Medicine) check.

SNARE

A snare can hold a creature in place, hoist a creature into the
air, or drag them into harm’s way. A snare can be made from
various materials such as rope or vine, which can be cut, or it
could be a mechanical device like a bear trap.

**_Effect._** The triggering creature must succeed on a Dexterity
saving throw or be restrained until it is freed. If the trap
is designed to deal damage when activated, it occurs
immediately. Snares generally deal either bludgeoning
or piercing damage. A successful Strength (Athletics) or a
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools frees the creature.

Snares can be designed to further damage a struggling
victim; a successful Strength (Medicine) or Constitution
(Athletics) check lets a creature avoid further damage if they
fail an attempt to escape this kind of snare.

SPEARS

Spears thrust out from the walls, floor, or ceiling at creatures
or into a nearby area. A spear head may be barbed to restrain
the target. Depending on the level and severity of the trap,
there may be multiple spears. Use the appropriate damage
and average on a 1d6 roll to determine how many spear
attacks to use. For example if the trap is a level 9-12 Setback
with an average of 16 damage, and a 1d6 deals an average of
4 damage, divide 16 by 4 to come up with 4 spear attacks.

**_Effect._** The trap makes one attack roll against creatures in the
area for every spear that’s activated, dealing piercing damage
on a hit. If the spears are barbed, a target wearing cloth or
leather armor is skewered and restrained on a hit. Creatures
restrained by spears can make Constitution (Athletics) checks
to free themselves, taking half damage from the trap if they
fail. Other creatures can free those restrained by the spears
with a Strength (Medicine) check, again dealing half damage
to the restrained creature if they fail.

```
SPIKES
This effect covers spikes attached to a fixed surface, which
can be almost anything. Possibilities include part of or the
entirety of a floor, wall, or ceiling, compartments within
stairs, a wooden block, inside a bowl of punch, etc. If a
creature could step on it, run into it, be pushed into it, or
otherwise come into contact with it, it can be spiked.
Effect. When a creature moves or is shoved into the spikes
it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes
full piercing damage on a failed save or half as much on a
successful one.
```
```
SPRING FLOOR
The spring floor either launches creatures straight up into
the ceiling, or into some other effects such as a pit, scything
blades, etc.
Effect. A creature in the trap’s area must make a Dexterity
saving throw or be launched upwards. Creatures that hit
a ceiling or object take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every
10 feet traveled (max 20d6). Creatures that fall back to the
ground take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet they
fall (max 20d6) and land prone, unless they avoid damage
from the fall.
```
```
SWINGING OBJECT
An object attached to a rigid structure (such as a wooden
or metal rod or beam) or flexible line (such as a rope or
chain) swings down from above, into the creatures’ path.
Containers filled with flammable liquid, or poisonous
powders, or an object with spikes on it can all be attached to
the swinging line.
Effect. The trap makes an attack against one creature it could
hit, unless the object is very large and could hit multiple
creatures. Usually the object deals bludgeoning damage,
but can just as easily be piercing if the object has spikes, or
slashing if it is a wide blade.
```

there may be multiple spears. Use the appropriate damage
and average on a 1d6 roll to determine how many spear
attacks to use. For example if the trap is a level 9-12 Setback
with an average of 16 damage, and a 1d6 deals an average of
4 damage, divide 16 by 4 to come up with 4 spear attacks.

The trap makes one attack roll against creatures in the
area for every spear that’s activated, dealing piercing damage
on a hit. If the spears are barbed, a target wearing cloth or
leather armor is skewered and restrained on a hit. Creatures
restrained by spears can make Constitution (Athletics) checks
to free themselves, taking half damage from the trap if they
fail. Other creatures can free those restrained by the spears
with a Strength (Medicine) check, again dealing half damage

128 Chapter Nine | Random Trap Generator

```
ANIMATED OBJECT
Nearby inanimate objects unexpectedly spring to life, either
with a spell like animate objects or with elaborate clockwork
mechanisms. By default, objects animate with orders to
attack anyone they see, but they could be ordered to simply
prevent entry within an area, or might not attack a creature
bearing a certain token or object.
Other orders for the objects could include removing creatures’
gear, herding them in a particular direction, keeping them
from leaving an area, serving them food and drink, bathing
them, singing an amusing musical number, cutting the
supports of a rope bridge, or assembling the pieces of a golem.
Effect. Whether animated with magic or mechanisms,
animated objects have game statistics based on their size as
per the animate objects spell. The object’s hit points and damage
might be different due to its material; a suit of armor may have
more hit points than a piece of furniture. The objects, once
animated, immediately execute the order that was set for them.
Objects remain animate for 1 minute or until reduced to 0 hit
points. If the objects were animated with magic, a successful
dispel magic returns the objects to normal.
```
```
BLINDNESS
A flash of extremely bright light or a wave of darkness
blinds any creatures in the area. This trap is most effective
when coupled with an immediate attack by other elements
of the trap, hostile creatures, or some other danger that can
take advantage of the blindness.
Effect (Spell Trap). Creatures in the trap’s area must succeed
on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for a duration
set by the trap’s lethality. Creatures can attempt another
Constitution saving throw at the end of each of their turns
if in combat, or at the end of each minute. On a successful
save, this effect ends for that creature. You can adjust the
interval between saving throws as needed.
If this effect is magical in nature, it can be dispelled with
dispel magic , or ended with remove curse or lesser restoration.
This effect can also create darkness that fills a 15-foot-
radius sphere around the triggering creature or an object.
The darkness spreads around corners. A creature with
darkvision can’t see through this darkness, and non-magical
light can’t illuminate it.
The darkness emanates from the triggering creature or
object and moves with it. Completely covering an object
with an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the
darkness. If any of this effect’s area overlaps with an area of
light created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that
created the light is dispelled.
As a spell trap (2nd level slot), the glyph casts blindness/
deafness or darkness on the triggering creature.
```
```
A E
Ambiguous effects can vary widely and could be either
magical in origin or some sort of natural phenomenon. A pit
could be filled with magically sustained fire, or be situated
on a geothermal vent. A water blast could be a magically
conjured jet of water, or a geyser.
```
```
ACID/SLIME BLAST
Acid or slime in liquid or ooze form sprays onto creatures.
Slime could be highly flammable, poisonous, suffocating,
or slick.
Effect. The particulars of this effect depend on the acid or
slime itself. An acid effect could be an actual ooze creature,
like a black pudding , or a spray of caustic chemicals.
If the trap sprays a jet of acid, creatures in the trap’s area
must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking full acid damage
from the trap on a failure or half damage on a success.
Slime can be flammable or slippery, making creatures in
the area vulnerable to fire damage or have to succeed on a
Dexterity saving throw to avoid falling prone. Slime could also
deal poison damage; creatures affected by such a trap must
make a Dexterity saving throw. They take full poison damage
from the trap on a failed save, or half as much on a success.
Creatures that fail a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the
slime could start suffocating instead of taking damage,
depending on the viscosity of the slime.
```
```
ADHESIVE
When triggered, the trap applies an adhesive to creatures.
The adhesive may take the form of a slime that bubbles out
of the floor, a layer of glue hidden under a trapdoor, or an
ooze that drips from the ceiling. An interesting situation
can occur if there is a chance that escape may mean leaving
boots, clothes, or other equipment behind, permanently
stuck in the fast-acting glue.
Effect. If the trap releases the glue onto creatures, it makes
an attack roll to hit them. Otherwise, creatures in the trap’s
area or creatures that enter the area make Dexterity saving
throws. A creature hit by the trap or that fails their saving
throw is restrained.
If restrained by the glue, a creature can pull themselves
free with a successful Strength (Athletics) check against the
traps’ DC. One creature can pull another out of the glue with
the same check if they are adjacent to each other.
```

Chapter Nine | Random Trap Generator 129

DEAFNESS

All creatures in the area go deaf due to a magic effect or an
incredibly loud noise.

**_Effect (Spell Trap)._** Creatures in the trap’s area must succeed
on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for a duration
set by the trap’s lethality. Creatures can attempt another
Constitution saving throw at the end of each of their turns
if in combat, or at the end of each minute. On a successful
save, this effect ends for that creature. You can adjust the
interval between saving throws as needed.

If this effect is magical in nature, it can be dispelled with
_dispel magic_ , or ended with _remove curse_ or _lesser restoration._

As a spell trap (2nd level slot), the glyph casts _blindness/
deafness_ on the triggering creature.

ELEMENTAL BLAST

A sudden eruption of fire, lightning, cold, thunder, water, or
other elemental force hits creatures in the trap’s area.

**_Effect (Spell Trap)._** This effect can have many variations,
depending on the type of energy or element. It can either
make an attack roll if it’s targeting a small number of
creatures, or it can affect an area and creatures must make
Dexterity saving throws to avoid it. Some possible options
for this effect are presented below:

**Acid Blast.** A burst of acid strikes the triggering creature.
The trap makes a ranged attack and deals acid damage on
a hit, and half the acid damage at the end of the creature’s
next turn. On a miss, the trap splashes the creature with acid
for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the
end of its next turn.

**Fire Blast.** Creatures affected by the trap must make a
Dexterity saving throw. They take full fire damage from the
trap on a failed save, or half as much on a success. Creatures
that fail their saving throw continue to burn, taking 1d4 fire
damage at the start of each of their turns. A creature can end
this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity
check to extinguish the flames.

As a spell trap (2nd level slot), the glyph casts _scorching ray_ ,
targeting all three rays at the triggering creature.

**Lightning Blast.** Creatures affected by the trap must make
a Dexterity saving throw. They take full lightning damage
from the trap on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

As a spell trap (3rd level slot), the glyph casts _lightning bolt_ ,
aimed at the triggering creature.

**Poison Spray.** The triggering creature must make a
Constitution saving throw, taking full poison damage on a
failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

```
Thunder Blast. Each creature in a 15-foot cube centered
on the triggering creature must make a Constitution saving
throw. On a failed save, a creature takes full thunder damage
and is pushed 10 feet away from the triggering creature. On a
successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and
isn’t pushed.
As a spell trap (1st level slot), the glyph casts thunderwave ,
centered on the triggering creature.
Water Blast. he trap makes an attack roll against a creature
it can affect. If it hits, the trap deals bludgeoning damage
and the creature must make a Strength saving throw or be
pushed 10 feet away from the trap.
```
```
EXHAUSTION
Creatures in the area begin to suffer from exhaustion due
to extremes of temperature or a magical enchantment. The
longer they linger, the more levels of exhaustion they endure.
Effect. Creatures in the trap’s area must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion.
Creatures can attempt another Constitution saving throw at
the end of each of their turns if in combat, or at the end of each
minute. On a successful save, this effect ends for that creature.
You can adjust the interval between saving throws as needed.
If this effect is magical in nature, it can be dispelled with
dispel magic , or ended greater restoration.
```
```
MOLTEN METAL
Trenches or channels in the area fill with molten metal when
the trap is triggered.
Effect. Creatures in the trenches when they are flooded,
or creatures that touch the molten metal for the first time,
must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes full
fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.
Each creature that ends their turn within 5 feet of a trench
filled with molten metal must succeed on a Constitution
saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion. Creatures wearing
heavy armor have disadvantage on their saving throw.
Additionally, when a creature enters a flooded trench,
it sinks 1d4+1 feet into the metal and is restrained. If a
creature is restrained by molten metal at the start of its turn,
it sinks another 1d4 feet. If the creature isn’t completely
submerged in the molten metal, it can escape as an action
by succeeding on a Strength check. The DC is 10 plus the
number of feet the creature has sunk into the molten metal.
A creature that is completely submerged in molten metal
can’t breathe.
A creature can pull another creature within its reach out of
the molten metal by using its action and succeeding on the
Strength check. The DC is the same as above, but the creature
helping has advantage.
```

```
POISON GAS
The trap triggers an expulsion of poisonous gas into the
area. Usually, toxic fumes create a thick cloud with a foul
smell and greenish hue. However, an alternative (and
especially lethal) version of this effect employs colorless,
odorless gas.
Detecting this gas requires a Wisdom (Perception) check
with disadvantage. Creatures that succeed recognize the
subtle signs of danger, such as hearing the hiss of the gas
filling the area.
Effect. A 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green
fog erupts from a point next to the triggering creature. The
fog spreads around corners. It lasts for 10 minutes or until
strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its area is
heavily obscured.
When a creature enters the fog’s area for the first time on
a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a
Constitution saving throw. The creature takes full poison
damage from the trap on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.
The fog moves 10 feet away from its starting point at the
start of each round, rolling along the surface of the ground.
The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of
the land, even pouring down openings.
```
```
WALL OF FIRE
The trap triggers a wall of fire that prevents creatures from
leaving the area. This could be a wall of fire spell, or flame
jets built into a surface, or a river of magma. As with other
effects the keep creatures in one place, this is most effective
when the creatures are simultaneously faced with another
danger that may be even worse than the flames.
Effect (Spell Trap). The wall can be up to 60 feet long, 20
feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet
in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is
opaque and lasts for 1 minute, although it can be dispelled
or disabled earlier. When the wall appears, each creature
within its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a
failed save, a creature takes the trap’s full fire damage, or
half as much damage on a successful save.
One side of the wall, determined by the trap’s designer, deals
the trap’s fire damage to each creature that ends its turn
within 10 feet of that side of the wall. A creature takes the
same damage when it enters the wall for the first time on a
turn or ends its turn there. The other side of the wall deals
no damage.
If the wall is mundane, a creature that is adjacent to the wall
can make a Constitution check using thieves’ tools to end
this effect.
As a spell trap (4th level slot), the glyph casts a ringed wall
version of wall of fire , centered on the triggering creature.

M E
Traps with magic effects are clearly wondrous in some way.
They either initiate spell effects when activated or they are
spells such as glyph of warding and symbol that function as traps.
Not all magic effects need to be explained by a spell that
already exists already. Magic can do nearly anything, so
you can come up with your own magic effects to best suit
your needs. To prevent complications though, try and do
this sparingly and make sure that the effect couldn’t be
duplicated with a spell. If you do create a custom effect,
make sure to give it a spell level appropriate to it’s severity
and school of magic for interactions with spells like detect
magic and dispel magic.
```
```
AGING
All creatures in the area are magically aged, either older
or younger.
Effect (Spell Trap). Creatures in the area must succeed on
a Constitution saving throw or be magically aged 1d10
years. If the roll is even, creatures are made younger; if odd,
creatures become older. The magical aging can be undone
with remove curse or more powerful magic.
As a spell trap (3rd level slot), the glyph casts bestow curse on
the triggering creature, inflicting the aging described above
as the curse.
```
```
AMNESIA
A hazy fog fills the mind or creatures in the area, blurring or
blocking memories.
Effect. Creatures in the trap’s area must make a Wisdom
saving throw. Those that fail lose a number of days of memory
based on the trap’s lethality, as shown in the table below.
```
```
Lethality Number of Days Lost
Setback 2 (1d4)
```
```
Moderate 3 (1d6)
Dangerous 4 (1d8)
```
```
Perilous 5 (1d10)
Deadly 6 (1d12)
A remove curse or greater restoration spell cast on a creature that
lost memories in this way restores that lost time.
```

Chapter Nine | Random Trap Generator 131

```
FEAR
The trap generates a terrifying force such as a haunting
figure, an evil cackle, or a low pitched rumbling growl.
Effect (Spell Trap). All creatures that can sense the terrifying
force must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become
frightened. A creature frightened this way must take the
Dash action and move away from the trap’s area by the safest
available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere
to move.
If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t
have line of sight to the trap’s area, the creature can make a
Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, this effect ends
for that creature.
This effect ends for all creatures if dispelled or after 1 minute.
As a spell trap (3rd level slot), the glyph casts fear on the
triggering creature.
```
```
HEAT METAL
A manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a
suit of heavy or medium metal armor, worn or wielded by
the triggering creature glows red-hot.
Effect. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes
fire damage from the trap, as per its severity. If a creature is
holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it,
the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or
drop the object if it can. If it doesn’t drop the object, it has
disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until it does so.
This effect lasts for 1 minute or until dispelled with dispel magic.
```
```
INVISIBILITY
The trap makes some or all objects or creatures in the area
invisible. Depending on the specifics of the trap, it could
only affect weapons, armor, hats, boots, or all objects.
Effect. The objects targeted by the trap become invisible.
If a target object is being worn or carried by a creature,
that creature can make a Constitution saving throw. On a
successful save, the targeted object doesn’t become invisible.
If this effect targets a creature, it must make a Constitution
saving throw or become invisible. Anything the creature
is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as it is on the
target’s person.
This effect lasts for a duration determined by its lethality, or
until dispelled with dispel magic.
```
BEWITCHMENT

The victim(s) of the bewitchment are beset by generally
bad luck.

**_Effect._** The triggering creatures must succeed on a Charisma
saving throw or be cursed by bad luck. When a cursed
creature enters a new situation or starts a new encounter,
roll a d20 and reference the table below.

This poor luck does **not** extend to dice rolls, inflict status
effects, confer advantage or disadvantage, or impact combat in
any way. It is intended to impact circumstances, such as extra
guards or a poor first impression with an important NPC.

```
d20 Bad Luck
1-2 Catastrophic. The circumstance is as bad
as it could be. Important NPCs are hostile
or the city watch is on high alert for some
reason. A serious, time-consuming, or
difficult impediment crops up.
```
```
3-9 Terrible. The circumstance is much worse
than it might otherwise be. There are a few
additional guards, a moderately difficult
complication, or an unfriendly NPC.
10-19 Unfortunate. The circumstance is slightly
worse than it might otherwise be. There’s
only 1 or two guards, an indifferent NPC, or
a complication that’s easy to overcome.
```
```
20 Lifted. The cloud of bad luck lifts and the
creature is no longer cursed.
```
At the end of each day, a bewitched creature can make a DC
15 Charisma saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for
that creature. _Remove curse_ or more powerful magic can also
end the bewitchment.

DISPEL MAGIC

When triggered, the trap dispels magic on creatures in its
area. Trap makers often make use of this kind of trap strip
intruders of their protective enchantments.

**_Effect (Spell Trap)._** The trap targets each creature in its area
with _dispel magic._ The trap uses a spell slot of 3rd level or one
determined by its severity, whichever is higher. If the has to
make a spellcasting ability check to dispel effects of a level
higher than it can automatically end, use its attack bonus as
its spellcasting ability modifier.

As a spell trap (3rd level slot), the glyph casts _dispel magic_ on
the triggering creature.


132 Chapter Nine | Random Trap Generator

```
PETRIFICATION
The trap turns creatures into stone, salt, wood, crystal, or
some other solid material.
Effect (Spell Trap). Creatures in the trap’s area must make
a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, creatures are
restrained as their flesh begins to harden. On a successful
save, the creature isn’t affected. A creature restrained by
this effect must make a Constitution saving throw at the
end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves against this
effect three times, the effect ends for that creature. If it fails
its save three times, it is turned into a statue of some solid
material and petrified. The successes and failures don’t
need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the creature
collects three of a kind.
For each affected creature, this effect lasts until dispelled,
either with dispel magic or greater restoration , or after a certain
amount of time, depending on the effect’s lethality. If a
creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from
similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.
As a spell trap (6th level slot), the glyph casts flesh to stone on
the triggering creature.
```
```
REANIMATE CREATURES
When the trap is triggered, it reanimates one or more dead
creatures in the area to attack, block, or otherwise impede
creatures. This effect requires some way to get a regular
supply of dead creatures.
Like the Animate Objects effect, the reanimated creatures
can be given a general command, such as to guard a
particular chamber or corridor. Otherwise, the creatures
mindlessly attack any other creatures in the area.
This effect could be used with a Corpse trigger; a body is
brought into the area, and then reanimated when the trap
goes off.
Effect. This effect turns piles of bones into skeletons or the
corpses of Medium or Small humanoids into zombies. The
number of creatures created depends on the trap’s lethality,
as shown in the Creatures table earlier. If there aren’t
enough bones or corpses in the trap’s area when it triggers, it
still makes as many creatures as it can. This effect can create
undead of higher CR if it’s severity allows.
Creatures reanimated by this effect stay active until reduced
to 0 hit points, or until 24 hours pass, at which point they
crumble to dust. The reanimated creatures will not leave the
trap’s area.
```
```
RESTRAINT
All creatures in the area are held in place. This can be via an
unseen force, or animated ropes or chains. As a simple trap,
a deadly version of this effect might just be very difficult to
break loose. However, as part of a complex trap, this effect
can expose creatures to great danger.
Effect (Spell Trap). All creatures in the trap’s area must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed. At the
end of each of its turns, a creature paralyzed by this effect
can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, this
effect ends for that creature.
This effect ends for all creatures if dispelled, either with
dispel magic or lesser restoration , or after a period of time
determined by the trap’s lethality.
As a spell trap (2nd level slot), the glyph casts hold person on
the triggering creature.
```
```
SEEMING
Creatures in the area are cloaked with an illusion, taking on
a new appearance determined by the trap creator. This can
make other creatures they encounter hostile; intruders into
a dwarven vault made to look like orcs will likely be attacked.
Effect. Creatures in the area must succeed on a Charisma
saving throw or gain a new, illusory appearance. The illusion
disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor,
weapons, and equipment. It can make each creature seem
1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between.
The illusory appearance has the same basic arrangement
of limbs as the target creature. Otherwise, the extent of the
illusion is up to the trap designer.
The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical
inspection. For example, if the illusion adds a hat to a
creature’s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone
who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature’s
head and hair. If the illusion makes a creature appear thinner
than it is, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch it
would bump into it while it was seemingly still in midair.
A creature can use its action to inspect a target creature and
make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against the trap DC.
If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.
The effect lasts for the duration determined by the trap’s
lethality, or until dispelled with dispel magic.
```

Chapter Nine | Random Trap Generator 133

```
The suggested course of action can continue for the entire
duration of the effect, determined by the trap’s lethality. If
the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time, the
effect ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do.
Casting dispel magic on a creature affected by the trap ends
the effect for that creature.
```
```
SUMMON CREATURES
When triggered, the trap summons creatures to the area.
Creatures summoned this way are usually considered
hostile, but do not necessarily need to be. The summoned
creatures can be given a general command, such as to guard
a particular chamber or corridor. Otherwise, the creatures
only act to defend themselves.
Effect (Spell Trap). The number of creatures summoned
depends on the trap’s lethality, as shown in the Creatures
table. Summoned creatures remain until reduced to 0 hit
points, or until an amount of time passes, based on the
trap’s lethality. The summoned creatures will not leave the
trap’s area.
As a spell trap (variable level slot), the glyph can cast any of
the conjure spells, such as conjure animals or conjure elemental.
```
```
SWAP
The trap makes a creature magically change places with
something else in another location. This exchange could be
used to transplant a dangerous creature into the midst of
the characters. It can also swap a creature with an object in
a dangerous area. The trap could even swap things such as
minds or personalities.
Effect. A target creature must succeed on a Charisma save, or
instantly switch places with something else. Usually, the swap
lasts for a duration determined by the trap’s lethality. However,
if the swap doesn’t put creatures in immediate danger it can
last for a longer amount of time, or be permanent.
If the swap involves non-physical things like personalities,
it can be reversed by ending the effect with dispel magic or
remove curse.
```
SLEEP

Creatures in the area are magically put to sleep. This effect
can be tailored to only affect only certain races, alignments,
genders, or other such criterion.

**_Effect (Spell Trap)._** All creatures in the trap’s area must
succeed on a Constitution saving throw or fall asleep.
Creatures put to sleep in this way remain unconscious
until the effect ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone
uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. Undead,
constructs, and creatures that don’t need to sleep aren’t
affected by this effect.

For each affected creature, this effect lasts until ended, either
with _dispel magic_ or _remove curse_ , or until 24 hours pass.

As a spell trap (1st level slot), the glyph casts _sleep,_ centered
on and including the triggering creature.

SPELL EFFECT

The trap is a _glyph of warding_ with a spell stored inside it, or
a _symbol_. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is
cast. A _glyph of warding_ can store any spell, except cantrips,
that targets a single creature or an area. The trap’s severity
determines the level of spell that the glyph can store.

This effect can also serve as a catch-all for any generically
magical effect that you want to use but doesn’t exist in a
specific form as a spell or other ability. Magic can do lots of
different things and this effect can conform to the needs of
your story. However, make sure that if you take this route
you consider how the players will interact with the effect.
Assign it a spell level and school of magic, and consider ways
that creatures can deal with the effect after it happens.

**_Effect._** If the spell has a target, it targets the creature that
triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area
is centered on that creature. If the spell summons hostile
creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they appear
as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the spell
requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full duration.

SUGGESTION

The trap implants a course of activity (limited to a sentence
or two) into the minds of creatures in the area and magically
influences them to carry out that idea. The suggestion must
be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action
sound reasonable. A suggestion that makes a creature stab
itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some
other obviously harmful act doesn’t take hold in the target
creature’s mind.

**_Effect._** Target creatures must make a Wisdom saving throw.
On a failed save, it pursues the course of action implanted
by the trap described to the best of its ability. Creatures that
can’t be charmed are immune to this effect.


134 Chapter Nine | Random Trap Generator

```
A transformed creature’s game statistics, including mental
ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the beast it
transforms into. It retains its alignment and personality.
The creature assumes the hit points of its new form. When
it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the
number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it
reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess
damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess
damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit
points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.
A transformed creature is limited in the actions it can
perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast
spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.
The creature’s gear melds into the new form. It can’t activate,
use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
At the end of each of its turns, a creature transformed by
this effect can make another Wisdom saving throw. On a
success, this effect ends for that creature.
This effect ends for all creatures if dispelled, either with
dispel magic or remove curse , or after a certain amount of time,
depending on the effect’s lethality.
As a spell trap (4th level slot), the glyph casts polymorph on
the triggering creature. It can also cast true polymorph , which
requires a 9th-level spell slot.
```
```
WALL OF FORCE
An invisible wall of force appears in the area, becoming a
confusing impediment.
Effect (Spell Trap). The wall of force can appear in any
orientation set by the trap’s designer, as a horizontal or
vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting
on a solid surface. It can be a hemispherical dome or a sphere
with a radius of up to 10 feet, or it can be a flat surface made
up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be
contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4
inch thick. If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it
appears, the creature is pushed to a random side of the wall.
Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune
to all damage and can’t be dispelled by dispel magic. A
disintegrate spell destroys the wall instantly, however. The
wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal
travel through the wall.
This effect ends after 24 hours, and the trap automatically
resets.
As a spell trap (5th level slot), the glyph casts a
hemispherical dome version of wall of force , centered on the
triggering creature.
```
```
TELEPORT
When the trap is triggered, it teleports creatures elsewhere.
Creatures don't need to be teleported into immediate danger,
though that's always a possibility. Just splitting up a group
can be problematic enough.
Effect. All creatures in the trap’s area must succeed on
a Charisma saving throw or be instantly teleported to a
location set by the trap’s designer.
```
```
TRANSMUTATION
When the trap is triggered, it unleashes magic which turns
one thing into another.
Effect (Spell Trap). All creatures in the trap’s area must
make a Wisdom saving throw. A creature that fails is
transformed into a random beast until the effect ends, they
drop to 0 hit points, or they die. This effect doesn’t work on
a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit points. Use the table
below to determine what beast the creature transforms into.

A burst of colorful shimmering light extends from
the target in a 30-foot radius. The target and each
creature in the area that can see must succeed on a
Constitution saving throw or become blinded for
1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw
at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.

The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, and
its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This
reduction decreases its size by one category—from
Medium to Small, for example. The target also has
disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength
saving throws and its weapons also shrink to match
its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the
target’s attacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this
can’t reduce the damage below 1). This effect ends if
dispelled with dispel magic (3rd level spell) or remove
curse , or after 1 minute.
```
WILD MAGIC

When triggered, a surge of chaotic magic fills the area and
makes an unexpected effect occur. This effect is designed to
be unpredictable and the possibilities aren’t limited to the
options in the table below.

**_Effect._** The trap targets a random creature in it’s area when
triggered, then roll d10 and consult the following table to
discover what happens.

136 Chapter Ten | Trap-Centric Dungeons

```
TRAP-CENTRIC DUNGEONS
Dungeons, ruins, crypts, and the like are all renowned for
being places that folk in their right minds avoid. One major
reason for this is that many of them are fraught with traps.
These ingenious, sometimes brutish, devices, contraptions,
and bits of magical malpractice are found all over, just
waiting for some hapless adventurers to come put them to
the test. There are plenty of times where having a monster or
ruffian go to work on the characters is a perfectly serviceable
course of action. At other times, good help is hard to find,
and you want something dependable that can do the job
without needing to be paid.
```
**LESS IS MORE**

```
Traps can get stale very quickly and can easily be
overused. A trap (especially a simple one) can often
be spotted and disabled by one character, leaving the
others waiting around. They can also hamstring certain
characters who are not well-suited for traps.
Be judicious about which traps you choose and why.
Make sure that you consider the capabilities of the
characters and provide opportunities for them to shine,
both as a group and as individuals. Try to have only
one major trap, one combat encounter and one social
situation between short rests. This gives most characters
a chance to do something meaningful in an encounter
between each short rest.
```
```
Overusing traps can make the game drag as players are
overcome with paranoia, searching and checking every
little thing. Traps are more effective and entertaining
when they are a surprise.
```

Chapter Ten | Trap-Centric Dungeons 137

```
Sliding Door (Initiative 20). The doors to and from the
antechamber grind slowly shut. After 2 rounds, the space
between the door and the frame is only big enough for a
Small creature. After 3 rounds, the doors are fully closed and
they lock shut.
Constant Elements. A cloud of sleep-inducing gas is injected
into the chamber through holes in the wall
Gas Cloud. Each creature that ends their turn inside
the antechamber must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution
saving throw or be knocked unconscious for 1 minute. An
unconscious creature wakes up if they take damage or if
another creature uses an action to shake them awake.
Countermeasures. Creatures can avoid activating the trap
with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. This
reveals the hidden mechanisms in the door, as well as the
small nozzles for the gas. A successful DC 10 Dexterity check
using thieves’ tools disables the trap.
Once activated, a creature can stop up the nozzles emitting
the Gas Cloud as an action, but they have disadvantage on
their Constitution saving throw to resist falling asleep.
```
```
P	 P
Magic trap (17-20, deadly, hinder)
This trap should be placed in a room that stores treasure,
including a particularly valuable or important object. When
a creature looks at the trapped object, it emits a pulse of
magic that causes fear and deals psychic damage.
Trigger (Look Into). If a creature looks directly at the
trapped object while within 5 feet of it, the trap triggers.
Effect (Spell Effect). Once triggered, the object glows with a
pale light, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for
10 minutes, after which time the effect ends and the trap
resets. Each creature in the sphere when the trap activates is
targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere
for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
Each target must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw
or become frightened by the object. A creature that starts
its turn frightened by the object must succeed on a DC 20
Wisdom saving throw or take 49 (9d10) psychic damage.
If a frightened creature ends its turn in a location where
it doesn't have line of sight to the object, the creature can
make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save,
this effect ends for that creature. This effect also ends for a
creature if dispel magic (DC19) is cast on them.
Countermeasures. A creature that succeeds on a DC 20
Wisdom (Perception) check can find hasty messages
scrawled on the walls of the room, as well as scattered bits
and bobs left by those running away. The trapped object has
an aura of abjuration and illusion magic when viewed with
detect magic.
A spellcaster can disrupt the enchantment on the trapped
object with a successful DC 20 spellcasting ability check;
dispel magic (DC 19) also disables the trap.
```
Traps for Small Spaces

Small spaces are usually less than a 20-by-25-foot room
(500 square feet). The dimensions and shapes can vary, but
what makes small spaces similar is that they are a room
or enclosed space, not a corridor, passageway, or other
primarily transitional space.

Small spaces are ideal for effects that are intended to impact
the entire group since they ensure that targets are easier to hit.
Gas clouds, collapsing floors, and magic glyphs are ideal for
small rooms. As a general rule, think about traps that can take
advantage of all potential targets being in close proximity.

F	 F

_Mechanical trap (13-16, dangerous, harm)_

This trap can be set in any small chamber. When too much
weight rests on the chamber floor, it gives way. Any creatures
in the chamber are dropped down into a pit filled with
flaming coals.

**_Trigger (Weight Sensitive Surface)._** When 500 or more
pounds of pressure are placed on the floor of the chamber,
the trap triggers.

**_Effect (Drop, Fire Jet)._** Each creature in the chamber must
make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a success, the
creature can grab onto the edge of the pit. On a failure, the
creature falls into the pit and takes bludgeoning damage.
The sides of the pit are sheer, requiring a DC 15 Strength
(Athletics) check to climb out.

Each creature that enters the pit for the first time on a turn,
or starts its turn there, takes 42 (12d6) fire damage from the
burning coals in the bottom.

**_Countermeasures._** A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the weight sensitive floor and hidden

_Mechanical trap (level 1-4, setback, subdue)_

This trap is set in the antechamber of any kind of dungeon.
The antechamber should have one entrance from outside
and one leading further into the dungeon. When creatures
enter and use the door that leads further into the dungeon,
the entrance door slowly begins to slide shut. Once shut, it
is almost impossible to open. To make matters worse, a gas
cloud fills the room that could knock creatures unconscious,
sealing them within the antechamber.

**_Trigger (Open/Close Door)._** A creature that opens the door
leading further into the dungeon triggers the trap.

**_Initiative._** The trap acts on initiative count 20.

**_Active Elements._** The exits from the antechamber slowly
seals shut.

Magic trap (level 13-16, perilous, harm)
This trap is set in a chamber containing a treasure chest
amongst piles of debris that litter the floor. The chest is
secured to the floor by thick chains linked to the handles of
the chest. When a creature attempts to pick the lock on the
chest, they trigger the trap. A glyph of warding (reverse gravity)
is hidden in the designs on the chest, causing creatures to
fall to the ceiling when activated. The debris scattered across
the floor falls upward as well, bombarding the characters.
Trigger (Attempt to Pick Lock). A creature that attempts to
pick the chest’s lock triggers the trap. Using a key does not
trigger the trap.
Effect (Spell Effect). When activated, the glyph casts reverse
gravity , reversing gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high
cylinder centered on the chest. All creatures and objects
that aren’t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall
upward and reach the top of the area when the glyph casts
this spell. A creature can make a DC 17 Dexterity saving
throw to grab onto a fixed object it can reach, such as the
chest, thus avoiding the fall.
If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this
fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as they would
during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature
reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it
remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.
This reversal of gravity lasts for 1 minute, or until dispelled
with dispel magic (DC 17). Once gravity is restored, affected
objects and creatures fall back down.
The debris scattered across the floor also falls upward toward
the ceiling, hitting any creature stuck there by reverse gravity.
Each creature on the ceiling must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity
saving throw to avoid taking damage from the objects.
Multiple saves may be necessary depending on the size of the
area and how far creatures must move to get to safety.
Countermeasures. A creature examining the chest can find
the glyph with a successful DC 17 Intelligence (Investigation)
check, or with detect magic. Once found, it can be disabled
with a successful DC 17 Intelligence (Arcana) check; dispel
magic also disables the glyph.
The chest can be picked open with a successful DC 17
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools.

Traps for Large Spaces
Large spaces are usually larger than a 20-by-25-foot room
(500 square feet). The dimensions and shapes of these large
areas can vary, but, like their smaller brethren, they are
often destinations, not transitional areas like hallways.
Large spaces are ideal for effects that can single-out or
endanger members of a group. Obstacles that separate
the characters from each other – such as runes of chain
lightning, falling objects, and summoned monsters – all
work well in larger areas. As a general rule, think about
things that might require more space to function well. This
is especially important if you’re considering combining a
combat encounter with a trap.
```
```
C T
Large spaces are usually where something important takes
place. Consider placing a trap that leads to a big moment in
the campaign. The ceiling of the dungeon collapses, an epic
monster is summoned, or the characters are paralyzed so
that the main antagonist can deliver their final monologue.
```
```
I T
Some trap triggers cover areas, but often they are centered
or focused on a specific point within a location. In large
areas, the trap engineer can take advantage of room features
that draw attention or beg inspection. This can be things
such as an item on display, a piece of architecture, or even a
sound emanating from an unclear source.
The trap effects can also take advantage of the wide space.
In a large area, setting up forty hidden crossbows with
enough ammunition to blanket the area in bolts is extremely
resource and labor intensive. Perhaps those resources are
available, but if it’s unlikely the engineer would be able to
build something like that, it is wise to consider what other
trap effects might be more reasonable for the space.

Hybrid trap (level 17-20, deadly, harm)
This trap should be set in a large chamber with multiple 10-
foot deep trenches cut into the floor. When creatures pass a
certain point in the chamber, scribed with a rune of detection ,
molten metal pours into the trenches. Additionally, a metal
barrier erupts from the floor, giving cover for a villain and
allowing them to escape.
Trigger (Pass Area). Creatures of a certain type, race, or
alignment (determined by the villain), moving past the rune
trigger the trap.
Initiative. The trap acts on initiative 20.
Active Elements. Gateways on the far wall open, spewing
molten metal that floods the trenches cut into the floor of
the chamber. A barrier also rises at the far end of the room.
Adamantine Barrier (Initiative 20). This element only
activates once, the first time the trap is triggered. A 10-foot
tall adamantine barrier rises from a platform at the far end of
the chamber, where a villain might be standing. The barrier
has a 1-foot high gap at the eye level of a Medium creature,
allowing creatures to see through it. The barrier counts as
three-quarters cover for anyone on the platform.
Molten Metal (Initiative 20). Creatures in the trenches
when they are flooded, or creatures that touch the molten
metal for the first time, must make a DC 20 Constitution
saving throw. A creature takes 87 (25d6) fire damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Additionally, when a creature enters a flooded trench, it
sinks 1d4+1 feet into the metal and is restrained.
Constant Elements. The molten metal in the trenches gives
off immense heat in a 5-foot area around it; creatures
restrained by the metal suffer fire damage.
Metal Trench. Each creature that ends their turn within
5 feet of a trench filled with molten metal must succeed
on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level
of exhaustion. Creatures wearing heavy armor have
disadvantage on their saving throw.
Sink or Swim. If a creature is restrained by molten metal at
the start of its turn, it sinks another 1d4 feet. If the creature
isn’t completely submerged in the molten metal, it can
escape as an action by succeeding on a Strength check. The
DC is 10 plus the number of feet the creature has sunk into
the molten metal. A creature that is completely submerged
in molten metal can’t breathe.
A creature can pull another creature within its reach out of
the molten metal by using its action and succeeding on the
Strength check. The DC is the same as above, but the creature
helping has advantage.
Countermeasures. The rune can be found with a successful
DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check, or with detect magic. Once
found, it can be disabled with dispel magic or with a successful
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check.
Once activated, a creature adjacent to the barrier can rip
it off its moorings with a successful DC 20 Strength check.
With a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, a
creature can make the barrier retract.

_Magic trap (level 13-16, moderate, harm)_

In the center of this large circular chamber is a beautiful
fountain or pool. Disturbing the water triggers the trap; a
barrier of blades springs up around the triggering creature,
and the temperature in the chamber drops over the course of
several rounds.

**_Trigger (Disturb Liquid)._** Any creature that disturbs the
water in the fountain triggers the trap.

**_Initiative._** The trap acts on initiative 20.

**_Active Elements._** A wall of blades forms around the fountain
or pool, emanating from a glowing ring of arcane symbols.

**Blade Barrier (Initiative 20).** This element only activates
once, the first time the trap is triggered.A ringed wall up to 60
feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick appears around
the fountain or pool. The wall provides three-quarters cover
to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the wall’s area for the first time on
a turn, it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a
failure, the creature takes 33 (6d10) slashing damage. On a
success, the creature takes half as much damage.

The wall of blades lasts for 10 minutes, or until dispelled
with dispel magic (DC 16).

**_Dynamic Elements._** The temperature in the chamber drops
markedly every round, quickly suffusing the room with a
bitter cold.

**Ice Cold.** The chamber drops to 0 degrees Fahrenheit and
decreases by 5 degrees every round.

**_Constant Elements._** Creatures in the chamber must navigate
the wall of blades while fighting off the deadly chill.

**Bitter Cold.** A creature must succeed on a DC 12
Constitution saving throw or gain 1 level of exhaustion
for each 1 minute they spend in the room after the trap is
triggered. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold
damage automatically succeed on this saving throw, as do
creatures with cold weather gear and creatures naturally
adapted to cold climates.

**Blade Barrier.** When a creature ends their turn inside the
wall of blades, it must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw.
On a failure, the creature takes 33 (6d10) slashing damage.
On a success, the creature takes half as much damage.

**_Countermeasures (Sensitive)._** A creature that succeeds on a
DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check can find the ring of arcane
symbols around the fountain, frosted over with unearthly
cold. The ring has an aura of evocation magic when viewed
with _detect magic_.

With a successful DC 12 Intelligence (Arcana) check, a
creature can disrupt the symbols without setting off the
trap. However, a check that totals 5 or less triggers the trap.
Casting _dispel magic_ (DC 16) on the ring also disables the trap.


140 Chapter Ten | Trap-Centric Dungeons

```
The side of each wall facing towards the center of the
corridor deals 22 (5d8) fire damage to each creature that
ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the wall. A
creature takes the same damage when it enters the wall for
the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. The other side
of each wall deals no damage.
Once active, the walls can be deactivated by closing or
blocking the gas vents. This requires a successful DC 12
Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine how they
might be thwarted, and then either a successful Dc 12
Strength check to block the vents, or a successful DC 12
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to close them.
Countermeasures (Sensitive). A successful Wisdom
(Perception) check reveals the tripwire, and a successful
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trap. However,
a Dexterity check that totals 5 or less triggers the trap.

P C
Mechanical trap (level 1-4, dangerous, harm)
If a creature walking through the corridor steps on a hidden
pressure plate, they trigger the trap. Darts laced with crawler
mucus fire from the doorframe at the far end of the corridor.
Trigger (Pressure Plate). Applying 20 or more pounds of
pressure to the pressure plate triggers the trap.
Effect (Darts). Darts shoot from the frame of the door at the
far end of the corridor. Each creature in the corridor must
make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature that fails
takes piercing damage and succeed on a DC 13 Constitution
saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned
creature is paralyzed. The creature can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on
itself on a success.
A creature that succeeds on its Dexterity saving throw takes
half the piercing damage and isn’t poisoned.
Countermeasures. A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)
check reveals the pressure plate, and a successful DC 15
Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trap.
```
Traps for Corridors

```
& Passageways
Corridors and passageways are spaces meant to be
transitional, leading from one area to another. They are
often narrow and are ideal areas for traps due to their
linearity. Traps such as hidden crossbows, scything blades,
and falling ceilings all benefit from targets with limited
mobility. The dungeon engineer is also able to much more
easily predict what potential targets will do and where they
will go in a passageway than in an open room.
```
```
BLOCKING THE WAY
Whether by a wall of fire or a 2-ton stone cube, blocking
the corridor at one or both ends creates a confined space
for the targets of a trap. This may even be used to separate
characters from one another.
```
```
PROJECTILES
Crossbows or darts are most effective when placed at the end
of the corridor. The target doesn’t have much space to dodge
out of the way, and if the projectile doesn’t hit the target in
the front it might hit a target further back.
```
```
B
 B
Mechanical trap (level 5-8, moderate, subdue)
A tripwire stretches across this thin corridor. Breaking
the wire triggers the trap and reveals gas vents along the
corridor. Ignited by a spark, the gas forms walls of fire to
erupt, sealing creatures in the corridor and separating them.
The vents are at 15 feet and 40 feet in a 50-foot long corridor.
Trigger (Tripwire). Breaking the tripwire triggers the trap.
Effect (Wall of Fire). Gas vents open and a spark causes them
to ignite, creating two walls of flame that block the corridor
at 15 and 40 feet. The walls reach from floor to ceiling and
are 1 foot thick. They are opaque and last for 1 minute.
When the walls appear, each creature within a wall’s area
must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
save, a creature takes 22 (5d8) fire damage, or half as much
damage on a successful save.

PERPLEXING PUZZLES

Puzzles are often confused with complex traps. However, a
trap can be disarmed while a puzzle must be solved. Puzzles
are often used as a filter of sorts, preventing those without
the right knowledge or who are unworthy from getting
access to an item or a place.

Good puzzles challenge the creatures interacting with them
in ways other than a trap or a monster. Puzzles can be simple
or complex, they may have a single stage or multiple stages
with escalating difficulty, and they may have mechanical or
magic elements. All of these aspects depend on who made it
and what the puzzle is intended to do.

C P	

Puzzles are, by their nature, designed to challenge _players_
rather than their characters. They are intended to engage the
brains of the players and give them an opportunity to tackle
an intellectual exercise. This often means ignoring most of
what’s on the character sheet and just letting the humans
around the table figure out the solution. Ability checks
should be used to offer hints when the group is stumped or
stalled, but don’t use them to simply give away the answer.

```
H P


Puzzles may or may not have an element that deals damage,
but such an effect should be passive or used as a penalty
rather than an integral part or purpose of the puzzle. A floor
with safe places to stand marked by runes while all other
places have a breakaway floor is a good example of this. If
the creature attempting the puzzle makes a mistake, the
penalty is a fall into the unknown.
```
```
U S
It can be jarring when a puzzle you introduce, especially a
complex one, is bypassed in an unexpected way.
When using puzzles in a freeform, tabletop game it is
important to know that sooner or later, players will solve a
puzzle in a way you did not intend. When this happens, do
not railroad players into finding your solution. Reward your
players’ ingenuity and enjoy the experience of seeing how
your players interact with your puzzle.
In situations like these, we have a hard-and-fast rule: a
working solution is the correct solution.

Dungeons
Dungeons don’t have to be designed around monsters or
traps. Instead, they can be designed around puzzles. Such
dungeons focus on problems that need to be solved using
player cleverness rather than in-game character prowess.
```
```
T
Theme is of particular importance when it comes to puzzles,
much more so than traps. Sometimes the mere fact that a
trap can dish out a desired effect is enough to use it. Puzzles,
on the other hand, say something about the dungeon’s
owner and reinforce the theme of a dungeon. For instance,
if a dungeon is the home of a lich who utilizes the undead, it
would make sense for puzzles in that dungeon to be themed
around death, life, and things tangentially related to those
topics. It is very important that the puzzles found in the
dungeon fit with its theme.
```
```
P

 P
A puzzle presents a problem that needs solving, and the
characters should be able to solve the problem. This means
that they must have access to the items, tools, or information
required to solve the puzzle. There might be clues available
in or around the puzzle, or they could have found some
something before reaching the puzzle.
If the characters aren’t ready for the puzzle, there needs
to be a clear way for them to understand that they should
come back later. They should also have some idea of what
will indicate when they are ready. It need not be so obvious
as “you must be this tall to ride” but there should be clear
indications of what they don’t have that they will need to
solve the puzzle.
In the case of puzzles characters may not be ready for, be
sure to provide other paths they can take. These alternatives
can lead them to places where they will find what they need
to solve the puzzle. If there are no alternate paths, ensure
that they can go back the way they came and track down
what they need to accomplish the puzzle.
Regarding the physical location of the puzzle, think like the
dungeon’s owner and ask yourself why they would want a
puzzle in a particular spot, instead of a trap or monsters. A
puzzle is, in most circumstances, a way to make sure that
those who deserve to can proceed, and those who don’t are
stuck. Avoid placing puzzles in arbitrary places. This will help
to make whatever is beyond the puzzle much more rewarding.

Premade Puzzles

Below you will find 30 puzzles that we have designed to be
usable in a wide array of environments and situations. We
encourage you to use them and modify them as you see fit.
Many of them will have optional adjustments or changes
that can be made, but they are by no means the _only_ changes
that can be made. If you think of something else, by all
means try it. Experiment and have fun!

ı. Walk the Plank

The entrance to the chamber is on level, stable ground, but
much of the rest of the room’s floor has collapsed, revealing
an area below the room. Several planks of wood in various
lengths, are laying near the entrance to the chamber.

Scattered around this lower area in a seemingly random
pattern are 15 feet high stone pillars which seem to have
been intended to support the now-collapsed upper floor.
Each column can accommodate one Medium or two Small
creatures safely. If the top of a column is occupied by a
Medium or two Small creatures and another creature of
Small or larger size attempts to move into or through the
occupied space, all the creatures must succeed on a DC 10
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Creatures that fail fall from the
pillar and take 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.

**_Solution._** Creatures must use the planks in order to cross
the chamber. Of the planks at the entrance, only three are
sturdy enough to span a gap between pillars. The sturdy
pieces are a 10-foot, 15-foot, and 20-foot piece. The pieces
can bridge gaps that are 5 feet less than their total length (ie.
a 20-foot plank can bridge a 15-foot gap). With a successful
DC 10 Intelligence (Nature) or Intelligence check using
woodcarver’s tools, a creature can determine if a plank is
sturdy or not.

Any configuration of the boards which allows the party
to cross to the other side is a correct solution. A creature
attempting to cross a rotted or unstable plank will fall once
they reach the middle of the plank. If it is adjacent to a
pillar when it falls, a creature can catch themselves with a
successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw.

**_Difficulty._** This puzzle is extremely flexible. To increase or
decrease the difficulty of the puzzle, the amount of sturdy
planks as well as the quantity and spacing of the pillars can
be altered. Decoy paths — paths where the available boards
would take you most of the way, but ultimately fall just short
— also increase the difficulty of this puzzle.

You can add some damaging element, such as spikes or a
river of magma, to the lower area as another way to increase
the challenge of the puzzle.

**_Planning_****.** Whether you implement this puzzle using
miniatures & terrain or simply using theatre of the mind,
it will be important to have a rough idea of pillar locations
in advance. Graph paper will allow you to easily mark the
distances between different pillars so you can guide your
players as they attempt to cross.

2. The Necrodial
A round metal object the size of an amulet hangs from
a necklace or chain. On one side, the amulet has four
concentric round dials, each inscribed with ten runes; the
other side is blank. The amulet is meant to contain a key,
gem, note, or other small object.
The dials on the amulet have a handle, ridges, or some other
method of rotation. Over the uppermost portion of each
dial is a small downward-facing triangle of raised metal to
indicate what rune is selected. In the center of the dials is a
button with a skull engraved on it.
**_Solution_**_._ Spinning all four dials to the correct rune and then
pressing down on the center button makes the amulet come
apart in two pieces.
The exact combination of runes necessary to solve this
puzzle is up to your discretion. Perhaps these runes are a
repeating motif in the hidden annals of a necromancer’s
study, or perhaps the runes are instead letters that must be
combined to spell out a particular 4-letter word.
**_Zap_**. Attempting to open the device with the wrong
combination of runes could be painful. A surge of lightning,
fire, psychic or necrotic damage could hit the holder of the
amulet if the combination is incorrect.
3. Revealed in Reflections
Several mirrors are suspended in midair, as if weightless.
They can be repositioned or rotated easily; once in place,
they remain perfectly still.
Within the area where these mirrors are found are objects,
decorations, or doors that are invisible to the naked eye.
These features are only visible if viewed through one or
more of the mirrors that float in this area.
**_Solution_**_._ Once the mirrors are repositioned, players must
find a method of interacting with the exit or retrieving
the objects that the mirrors reveal. This could involve
interacting with the objects in real life as if they’re invisible,
or perhaps even stepping _through_ the mirror to bring objects
back through to the real room. Allow the players’ creativity
to shine in how these mirrors are used, especially if combat
or other nefarious traps and dangers are present.
**_Shining Shields._** Any reflective surface, such as well-shined
metal, will do in place of mirrors if you desire. Perhaps
even bodies of water could be utilized and positioned in
interesting ways!


144 Chapter Eleven | Perplexing Puzzles

4. Tears of the Angels
A chamber has one or more exits, but they are all blocked by
heavy stone doors. In the center of the chamber is a raised
platform with a stone pressure plate. On the pressure plate sit
three empty, silver decanters, beautifully adorned with elvish
script and filigree. Each one is a different size: large, medium,
and small. Upon close inspection, the bottom of the decanters
have numbers on them, indicating how many glasses of wine
they can hold. The large decanter holds 7 glasses, the medium
on holds 5, and the small one holds 3. One of the decanters
weighs down a note with the following words:
_In the greatest decanter
shall be served wine for friends
Just enough for the four of us
For our fifth has met their end._
If any of the vessels are removed from the pressure plate,
the pressure plate rises slightly. A heavy stone door descends
from above to cover the entrance into the room, sealing
the party inside. The entrance and all exits can now only be
opened once the puzzle is solved.
Also in the chamber is a statue of an angel, its head bowed.
Tears steadily flow from the corners of its closed eyes,
trickling in small rivulets down into a shallow basin held in
its hands at waist height. The bowl appears to remain full,
but does not overflow.
**_Solution._** The object of the puzzle is to fill the large vessel with
four glasses worth of liquid. The most obvious source of liquid
to complete this puzzle is the angel’s basin, which contains
more than enough to attempt the puzzle multiple times. There
are many ways to solve the puzzle, but the following is an
example of a correct solution:
1. Fill the medium decanter.
2. Pour the contents of the medium decanter into the small
    decanter until it is full.
3. Pour the remaining contents of the medium decanter (2
    glasses of liquid) into the large decanter, and empty the
    small decanter.
4. Repeat steps 1 and 2, so that another 2 glasses of liquid
    end up in the medium decanter.
5. Pour the contents of the medium decanter into the large,
    now bringing the large decanter to contain 4 glasses of
    liquid.
6. Set the large decanter on the pressure plate.
Once the large vessel is set on the pressure plate and
contains exactly 4 glasses worth of liquid, all exits from the
chamber open.
**_No Sweat._** Puzzles involving distribution of water and
finding exact measurements using less-than-ideal
containers are a classic trope, and likely to be something that
at least _some_ players are familiar with. That makes “Tears
of the Angels” a great lower-stress puzzle, or perhaps an
introduction to more complex versions of the same puzzle
concept in other forms.
    5. Descension
    On the floor of this chamber are 4 concentric circles. The
    largest circle is 10 feet in diameter, while the smallest is 5
    feet in diameter. The 3 outermost circles each appear to be
    made of a single piece of metal which, imbedded into the
    floor. These metal rings each have 12 2-inch-diameter holes
    evenly spaced around their perimeter, and each hole is
    marked with a unique rune. Placing a piece of wood, spear
    shaft, or other such object into a hole allows the connected
    ring to be rotated without difficulty.
    The innermost circle is made of twelve triangular-shaped
    wedges all pointing inward, similar to a sliced pie. If tapped
    or prodded the wedges sound solid, and if stuck with a
    hammer they will chip but not shatter — they are quite
    strong. A line is burned into the metal plating of one of
    the innermost triangular wedges. Directly across from this
    line, on the floor outside of the largest circle, is another line
    marked or carved into the floor.
    **_Solution_**_._ In order to solve this puzzle, the three outer rings
    must align between the marked lines in the correct order.
    The runes on the rings could represent months, astrological
    signs, faces in a card deck, or perhaps letters that spell a
    3-letter word, acronym, or a character’s initials. The correct
    orientation of the rings is completely variable depending on
    what suits your campaign.
    When the three metal rings are properly aligned, the
    segments of the innermost circle begin to descend slowly,
    each wedge stopping lower than the one previous until a 10-
    foot deep spiral staircase has formed. This staircase could lead
    to a lower level, a secret chamber, or a hidden passageway.
    **_Control Rod_**. For more complexity, rotating the rings could
    require a specific object. This object could be necessary due
    to a special locking mechanism that prevents any other
    object from rotating the ring. To add yet another level of
    complexity, each ring could require a different object in
    order to rotate it.

```
with P-... Sand
Characters enter a massive 40-foot wide and 50-foot long
room. There is an empty 5-foot square at the entrance and
exit of the room, on the far side, but otherwise, the entirety
of the ceiling, walls and floor are all covered in churning,
gravity-defying sand. Amidst the sand are a number of
large, obvious buttons.
If creatures touch any part of the sand, it will begin to
suck them in. It takes 1 round for the sand to fully absorb a
creature, and 6 seconds for them to reemerge on the ceiling,
wall, or floor exactly opposite of where they entered. When
characters reemerge, they continue to fall in the direction they
were previously sucked into the sand. This means characters can
“fall” vertically or horizontally, even in opposing directions;
gravity is relative to each creature depending on the
direction they were sucked into the sand.
Solution. The party must find ways to redirect their gravity,
reposition themselves, and push or pull each other, while
falling in order to hit the buttons, making them light up. You
can use a map to show the location of these buttons can be
shown or describe them verbally (ex: “There is a red button
20ft high and 40ft across on the left wall.”)
Once all buttons are lit, any falling creatures are sucked into
the sand a final time before emerging right-side up from the
sandy floor. At this point, the exit door unlocks and the sand
becomes walkable.
Shifting Sands. Combat in this room would be an absolute
nightmare, and is thus highly discouraged. However, if you
are a particularly brave (or unstable) GM with an excellent
working knowledge of 3D space, or have players that have
seen it all, feel free to give it a try!
```
6. Turn Back Time

A sundial sits on a pedestal in a circular room filled with
light. Directly across from each hour mark on the sundial is
a sconce on the wall. Each sconce features a small lever in an
upright position.

Switching a lever down will extinguish the flame for 30
seconds as the lever cranks back upwards. When the lever
returns to the upright position, the sconce reignites. Aside
from the lever, the sconces have some sort of enchantment
that prevents creatures from tampering with the flame or the
sconce itself.

The exit to the room is utterly sealed and unable to be
opened directly by mundane or magical means. A doorstop
sits on the floor nearby.

**_Solution._** Extinguishing all but one of the sconces casts a
shadow on the sundial, thus displaying a particular time.
When this happens, the room surrounding the sundial
changes to reflect the previous state it was once in, at time
shown on the dial. One of the hours on the dial reveals a
time when the exit was open. The party must use a wedge or
heavy object to prop the door open before the torches reset.
Characters may also try to escape through the door before it
closes without propping it open, which is entirely possible,
though that would make a return journey quite challenging.

**_Turn Back Time._** The hours on the sundial could instead be
tied to spans of time other than literal minutes and hours. For
instance, 1 o’clock on the sundial might instead show the room
as it was 100 years ago. In this case, perhaps there is no exit in
the present, but 100 years ago, there was a door in one of the
walls that now opens when the sundial shows 1 o’clock.

**_So That’s What Happened._** Though the main goal of the
puzzle is to exit the room, other hours on the sundial can
still reveal information that is of interest to the characters.
For example, casting a shadow at 3 o’clock could show a
merchant finishing a journal entry before being placing
the book in a desk. This journal entry could perhaps even
contain a message meant specifically for the party by an
unknown author.

Aside from the exit door, other objects around the room may
rearrange, appear, or disappear according to the shadow cast
on the sundial. Feel free to play around with this concept and
potentially craft an underlying story as to what occurred at
each hour of the sundial.

An Object Lesson. This puzzle lends itself to certain settings
or applications more than others. It could be a teaching
tool found in a monastery or church to teach the lesson
that “patience is a virtue.” Or it could be an intentional test
of restraint, meant to find out how long it takes the group
to “solve” the room. If it takes them longer than a certain
amount of time, perhaps they’re refused a prize or are
simply met with disappointment from the test-giver. Or the
puzzle could be a delaying tactic, allowing something else to
catch up to the party, or give someone monitoring the room
extra time to react.
One or the Other. The room could be set up so there are 2
exit doors and the timer is between them. If the timer ends
in a certain amount of time or less, the left door is opened,
and the right remains shut. If the timer takes longer, the
left door remains shut and the right door opens. In this
situation, the left door is assumed to have something
positive waiting.
```
8. Wicked Patience
This 15-by-15 foot room has a lever on the back wall and on
the right wall is a metal door. Evenly spaced along the stone
walls are a series of small, numbered, 1-foot-diameter metal
hatches that cannot be opened and do not have handles. One
of these is above the metal door.
Pulling the lever makes a large, metal door slam down over
the entrance to the room, barring creatures from entering or
exiting. The hatch above the right door slides open to reveal
a countdown timer made of small numbered wooden tiles,
automatically flipping as time ticks down.
Once the lever has been pulled, and the door has slammed
shut, hatches 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 10 open to reveal a series of

9. Sea Legs

The floor of this area is one large slab or wooden deck, 40
feet wide and as long as necessary. Down the center of the
deck runs a narrow, 5-foot-tall barrier. The entire floor is
mounted on a horizontal cylindrical beam or log running
directly below the barrier, allowing the floor to tilt.

At the entrance to the room is a 10-foot wide doorway; a
5-foot wide door covers one half, leaving the other half
open. Once someone enters through the open half of the
doorway, the door slides over, opening the other side and
forcing creatures to enter the room on both sides of the
barrier. Creatures can then attempt to move across the floor,
but run the risk of tipping the floor if they’re not careful.

Determine which way the floor tips by following these steps
and referencing the diagram below:

- Everyone rolls initiative. The puzzle always acts last.
- Everyone is allowed a turn as normal to move and take
    an action. When moving, the entirety of the floor is
    always considered **difficult terrain**.
- Values are totaled for each side of the barrier. Each
    “lane” of space to the right or left of the barrier has a
    value for every 5 feet of distance from the barrier (+1, +2,
    +4, +8). A creature generates that value for each space
    they occupy for whatever side of the barrier they’re on.
    This means a Large creature adds +6 to the side they are
    on (2 spaces in the +1 lane, 2 spaces in the +2 lane).
    - Total the amount for the left side.
    - Total the amount for the right side.
- The room tips in the direction of the side with the
    larger number.
       - Subtract the lower total from the higher total, then add
          10. This new number becomes the DC of the Dexterity
          saving throw that all creatures on the floor must make to
          hold their ground.
       - Any creature that fails the saving throw slides down the
          tipped floor. If they are on the higher side of the barrier,
          they slide into it. If they are on the lower side of the
          barrier, they slide to the edge and must make a second
          Dexterity saving throw (same DC) or fall over the edge.
       - Now that the floor is tilted, the lane values of the higher
          side of the barrier are reduced to +0, +1, +2, and +4. This
          represents the difficulty of fighting gravity and reducing
          the incline. You may skip this value change to simplify the
          puzzle if desired.
       - Repeat the steps as necessary.
**_Solution._** The characters simply need to cross the floor to
the exit, hopefully without losing a friend or two to the
unknown depths waiting below the tipping floor.
**_Heads Up._** When the floor tips, if someone on the upper
portion of the floor fails their Dexterity saving throw by 5 or
more, have them bounce, fly, or roll _over_ the barrier and wind
up on the edge on the opposite side!
**_Wall Walker._** Depending on how steep the floor gets, ability
checks using skills like Climbing or Acrobatics might be
necessary to prevent slipping or falling. Axes or daggers
stabbed into the surface can also keep a creature from
sliding. Let your players get creative with their preventative
attempts, and allow unorthodox solutions that make sense
when they try to save themselves from a slippery demise.
**_How Long?._** The length of the room can have a strong
impact on this puzzle’s difficulty because it will lengthen the
amount of time the characters are on the floor. Keep their
speed in mind when choosing your room length. Keep your
players’ overall patience and sanity in mind as well.
**_Rolling Around._** A combat encounter or the presence of
other weighted objects could make this puzzle much more
unpredictable. Adjust this puzzle concept however you
desire in order to spice things up!
**_Crunch the Numbers._** If you care to be a bit more
simulationist, here are some ways in which you can alter the
puzzle’s numbers:
- -1 from a side’s total for each Small creature on that side.
- -2 from a side’s total for each Tiny creature on that side.
- When the floor tips and is no longer level, the lower
floor’s values could change to +2, +4. +8, and +16.
Climbing over the barrier to get to the other side will be
necessary to adjust the weight.

```
ı0. Puzzle Floor
The floor of the room is covered in tiles, and the exit is locked.
Except for one, all the tiles are smooth and unremarkable. The
unique tile has a rune, letter, or other marking.
When a creature stands on the unique tile, it glows; all
adjacent tiles then reveal glowing symbols which were
previously hidden. Stepping to an adjacent tile will then
reveal the other symbols adjacent to it, and so on.
Solution. Stepping on the tiles in the correct sequence
unlocks the exit.
For a puzzle like this, clues are incredibly important. Prior
to arriving at this puzzle, introduce knowledge about who
rules the dungeon. A journal or written orders that mention
important information, a repeated motif, or strange sequences
of unknown symbols could hold the solution to this puzzle.
The entire solution to the puzzle could only be learned once
different clues (such as separate pages) are found and viewed
together. When looking at the clues all at once, it should be
clear what they all have in common, be it a word, a name, a
sentence, etc. You can even write the solution on a piece of
paper, tear the paper into 3-6 pieces, and make each of those
pieces into a clue the players must retrieve.
In order to set up this puzzle, you can follow these steps:
```
1. Determine what your solution will be.
2. Figure out how many tiles that solution would occupy (i.e.
the word “love” would occupy 4 tiles if each tile was a letter).
3. On a grid, lay out the path you would like the party to
take, placing each letter or symbol of the correct solution on
a separate tile.
4. Fill in any remaining empty tiles with other symbols.
**_Spell It Out._** For a more in-depth challenge, each tile of
your puzzle floor could contain an entire word as opposed
to a single letter or symbol. Perhaps the party came across
a journal in which the villain wrote down his greatest life
philosophy amongst their other rantings. Stepping on the tiles
that spell out this important sentence could be the solution.
If using words, try giving the words adjacent to each glowing
tile a sense of cohesion, with at least some of the revealed
words making sense in context. For instance, if the starting
tile is the word “I,” possible words adjacent to it could be
“love”, “hate”, “go”, “went”, “feel”, “think”, etc.
**_Where to Begin._** To make this puzzle more difficult, you can
remove the starter tile entirely. This makes _all_ the tiles blank,
forcing the party to experiment and find their starting position.
**_Are We Done Here?_** To ensure the engagement of all party
members, create a solution with a number of tiles equal to
your number of players. Then, the solution to the puzzle
could require characters to all be standing on a tile.
**_Don’t Step on That!_** If you’re feeling particularly devilish,
stepping on an incorrect tile can erase the characters’
progress, forcing them to restart at the beginning.

```
ıı. Spin-N-Smash
This 40-foot diameter circular room has an entrance on one
end and an exit directly across from it. A thick vertical axle
goes from floor to ceiling at the dead center of the room.
Affixed horizontally to this axle is a massive boom arm
which sweeps a 15-foot diameter circle inside the room; the
boom is 10 feet wide and 15 feet long. The party must cross
the room across a series of tiles, each of which spin the arm
either clockwise or counter-clockwise.
The room is enchanted with an effect similar to reverse
gravity , but instead of changing the direction of gravity this
effect increases its pull. A creature can only move 5 feet on
its turn, or 10 feet if the creatures takes the Dash action. This
enchantment also prevents flight and levitation of any sort,
and makes jumping nearly impossible.
Each traversable tile in the room is marked with a
clockwise or counterclockwise arrow in the diagram below.
Immediately after a creature steps on a tile (even in the
middle of its turn), the boom arm swiftly spins a quarter-
turn in the tile’s indicated direction.
```
```
When the boom arm spins, creatures whose space the boom
arm would move into or through must make a successful
DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. A successful saving throw
means the creature was able to avoid being struck. A failed
saving throw results in 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and the
creature is knocked prone.
Being hit with the arm is intended to hurt, but not kill. If
a creature dies from this puzzle, it should be because they
were battered over and over and over by the boom arm (and, at
that point, could anyone truly be upset by their fate?)
A Medium sized or larger creature who shares a space
with the arm can only do so by squeezing. Creatures can
intentionally go prone and lie flat enough to avoid the boom
arm, should it swing through. Due to the room’s increased
gravity, crawling or moving while prone is entirely too
difficult to accomplish.
```

Chapter Eleven | Perplexing Puzzles 149

**_Solution_**_._ Players must move through the room to the exit,
taking as little damage as possible.

**_Mix it Up._** The clockwise and counterclockwise symbols need
not be arranged in the configuration shown. If you think of a
different arrangement, feel free to experiment.

**_What Does This Mean?_** The symbols on the tiles do not need
to so obviously illustrate clockwise and counter-clockwise.
There could be hints or a translation of these symbols earlier
in the dungeon, or the characters could simply discover what
the symbols do through experimentation.

**_Backwards._** Especially devious GMs could add an additional
twist: each time a character successfully exits the room,
the meaning of the symbols _reverses._ At that point, all
counter-clockwise symbols will start rotating the boom
arm clockwise, and vice versa. Whether this change is
represented by the actual symbols on the tiles, or is simply
left to be discovered in flabbergasted horror by your players,
is entirely up to you.

ı2. Three-Bottle Quaff

On a table in this room are 6 potion bottles, each filled with
a different liquid and carrying a unique label. The numbers
1-6 are drawn on a nearby surface such as a table, bookshelf,
or individual stools. Indentations or clean circles amidst the
dusty surface indicate that a bottle is meant to be placed by
each number.

Players are also presented with the following riddle, either
verbally or in writing:

_One’s the money,
Two is funny,
Three’s a filthy liar!
Four’s a pain,
Five’s insane,
and Six will soon retire._

_Once three potions are consumed,
You may move on (but you may be doomed!)_

None of the bottles are numbered, but they do carry
labels with unique text. This text is the key to determining
a potion’s number, which can then be compared to the
descriptions in the riddle.

**_Solution_**_._ In order to proceed (either into a secret passage,
through a locked door, or past the person presenting the
test), the party must consume 3 of the 6 potion bottles in
their entirety.

No numbers are written on the potion bottles themselves.
However, the true number of each potion can be determined
by the number of exclamation points found on each label.
Using this information paired with the riddle, the more
dangerous potions can hopefully be avoided.

These potions should be presented in a random order. The
label and effects of each potion are as follows:

```
Potion
Number
```
```
Label Effect When Consumed
```
```
1 “For
emergencies!”
```
```
The creature heals 2d4+2
hit points.
2 “One drop
per audience
member!!”
```
```
The creature falls
prone and laughs
uncontrollably for
2 minutes. They are
incapacitated during this
time.
```
```
3 “This one
REALLY hurts!!!”
```
```
The creature burps
loudly. It tastes like
coconut. Nothing else
happens.
4 “Caution! Do not
drink! Contents
are poisonous!!”
```
```
The creature is poisoned
until they finish a long
rest.
```
```
5 “DriNK?!?!
DRink! Tell
THE WoRLd
of the cOMing
APOcaLyPse!!”
```
```
The creature is
paralyzed for 1 minute.
At the end of that
minute, the creature
takes 2d4 psychic
damage after suffering
strange antagonistic
hallucinations.
6 “Made! While!
Drunk! Please!
Consume!
Wisely!”
```
```
The creature gains one
level of exhaustion.

ı3. Too Tall to Ride
Characters open the door to an abandoned laboratory, study,
library, or other space containing information or valuable
goods. Though the door is normal-sized, the handle to the
door is only 1.5 feet from the base.
As soon as a Medium or larger creature opens the door, a
loud, high-pitched alarm rings out. Whether this space is in a
location where the ringing alarm could wake guards, frighten
civilians, or alert nearby monsters is up to your discretion.
Shutting the door turns off the ringing if the room is empty.
When inside the room with the door closed, the ringing is not
loud enough to alert people outside the room.
For those inside the room, the ringing is not loud enough
to cause pain, but it is loud enough to drown out all other
sources of sound, including speech. While the alarm is
sounding, all precious materials in this room (books,
ingredients, potions, treasure, etc.) are enclosed behind bars
or some type of magical ward until the alarm can be shut off.
Solution. Players must note from your description of the
door and room contents that the room’s former occupant
was exceptionally small. Examples of hints include the door
handle’s height; the presence of tiny desk, chair, and writing
utensils; a small coat hung on a low rack; or the presence
of many various ladder sizes to ascend and descend the
bookshelves.
If no Medium sized or larger creatures are in the room, the
alarm stops ringing, and all previously barred materials in
the room become accessible.
It’s All Small. This idea can be extended further to multiple
rooms, or even an entire building. Remember that crawling
creatures move half speed, or one-third speed over difficult
terrain.
```
```
ı4. The Gift of a Linguist
A tall wooden door contains etched lines of text written in
different languages. Each line of text is preceded by a carved
symbol, and followed by a circular lock. Both the text and
symbol in each line hint at a task that must be completed to
open each lock.
Solution. When a task is successfully fulfilled, the
corresponding lock makes an audible click as it opens. It’s up
to you how many locks must be unlocked to open the door.
It’s also up to you to decide what languages each line of text is
written in, and what tasks the text demands. At least one line
of text should be in Common, since almost all creatures speak
this language. Other options include, in order of difficulty:
```
**- Easy.** Common
**- Moderate.** Dwarven, Elvish
**- Hard.** Celestial, Draconic, Gnomish, Halfling, Infernal,
    Undercommon
**- Very Hard.** Aarakocra, Abyssal, Aquan, Auran, Deep
    Speech, Druidic, Giant, Goblin, Gnoll, Ignan, Orc,
    Primordial, Sylvan, Terran


Chapter Eleven | Perplexing Puzzles 151

ı5. Blossoming

Connections

A large flower-like design is arrayed on the floor of this
room, either carved into the ground or outlined with stones,
shrubs, or other natural material. At the center of the flower
stands a stone pedestal. The petals of the flower extend from
the base of the pedestal, and the petals cross each other like
a Venn diagram.

A single white flower somehow thrives on the top of the
pedestal. Neatly engraved on the pedestal is the following
statement:

_Here lies a beautiful pair, whose bond was so strong that they passed
on together. From their grave blossomed a beautiful flower: the truest
representation of their connection. Even in death their love lives on here,
continuing to bless those who present tokens of their own shared bonds._

When a creature steps into the space of a flower petal at any
time, that petal glows with a faint light, the color of which is
unique to every creature (determined by you). If two creatures
occupy the same petal at any time, the glow disappears.

When two creatures stand next to each other in petals that
overlap, the overlapping section of petal glows white, and
a second pedestal emerges from the floor in the center of
the flower.

**_Solution_**_._ Each pair of creatures must present a physical token
of their relationship with the creature in the petal beside
them. For example, the pair could place a weapon on the
pedestal if they bonded while training together. They could
also present an important item the two found together, a pair
of binoculars to represent their night watches together, or
even an inside joke scribbled on a note. Whether the token
presented accurately represents that pair’s bond is up to your
discretion (and the pair to defend, if necessary.)

If the token is deemed worthy, each individual’s petal glows
brighter, and their shared pedestal descends into the earth.
When it reemerges, two flowers lay on or next to their
presented token. The flowers are a mix of each individual’s
color (for example: an orange and yellow swirl, for individuals
standing in orange-lit and yellow-lit petals). These flowers
will never wilt, but are otherwise non-magical.

**_I Don’t Know Them._** If two creatures stand next to each
other and are strangers or do not share a bond, the
overlapping petal glows gray, and the pedestal does not rise.
If two individuals stand next to each other who actively
dislike or hate each other, the overlapping petal goes black,
and their personal colored lights disappear.

```
Before the Last Petal Falls. The puzzle as-is provides room
for character building and roleplay opportunities; the
flower becomes a permanent, physical manifestation of
two characters’ shared bond. These flowers can become
a powerful symbol throughout the game if you let them.
Perhaps if the characters’ bond strengthens or weakens,
the flower can grow brighter or more dim to represent that.
Perhaps the flower can become more poignant still if one of
the characters represented in its colors passes on.
All for One and One for All. For a more challenging or
rewarding experience, you can adjust the number of petals
to fit the number of characters in your party. Instead of each
individual pedestal lowering with a valid token, all pairs
have to find a valid token of their bond before the puzzle
is solved. This is more difficult, so perhaps completing the
puzzle causes a more powerful magic item to materialize on
the central pedestal, or perhaps the pedestal itself descends
to reveal a secret room or passageway.
```
```
ı6. The Impossible Boy
The characters enter any empty space, be it a dungeon room
or a seemingly abandoned building, with a bright lantern
that sits on a stool against one wall. The lantern casts strong
shadows around the room. The shadow of a small humanoid
figure is projected on one wall, but nothing in the light’s
path could possibly cast such a shadow.
Once the characters spot the shadowy silhouette, it begins
to jump up and down and wave at them, gesturing its arm
in a beckoning motion. If they attempt to approach the wall
or interact directly with the shadow on the wall, it simply
shakes its head and repeats the gesture.
Solution. One of the characters must cast their shadow onto
the wall, repositioning the light if necessary. Once their
shadow is on the wall, the shadowy figure excitedly beckons
them closer, putting its hand by its face. If the character
allows their shadow to approach the shadowy figure, they feel
a hand on their physical ear as they hear the voice of a young
boy. The voice whispers that he needs help retrieving his
favorite ball, which is hidden somewhere in the room. You can
determine where the ball is and how hard it is to find.
Once they find the ball, the characters give it to the boy by
casting its shadow on the wall. When the boy takes it, the ball
disappears from the physical hand of the creature presenting
it. As a token of thanks, the boy then hands over a gift that
materializes in the hand of the presenting creature. This could
be anything from a magic item to simply a mote or ball of
shadow, the use of which is up to your discretion.
Who is This Boy? Characters may try to learn more about
this shadow boy or interact with him in other ways. Feel free
to let your imagination run wild as to what history or other
capabilities this shadow may have, and what other potential
purpose he could have in your world!

ı7. Predicament in

```
Purgatory
The characters enter a storage room filled with hundreds
of uniquely shaped, ash-filled terra cotta urns. Scattered
among them, easily noticeable, are 6 empty, clay urns,
painted with vibrant colors: green, purple, magenta, orange,
red, and blue. The purple, magenta, and red urns have square
bases, while the green, orange, and blue urns have round
bases. This information should be made clear to the players
from the start.
At the far end of the room is a small empty fireplace. In the
floor of the hearth are 6 urn-sized indents in an alternating
square-circle pattern:
```
```
On the mantle over the hearth is a folded piece of parchment
with the following message written in elegant calligraphy:
Apple, Pinky, Cherry, Violet, River, and Oz’flob died at the very same
instant. The day their spirits arrived at the gates to the afterlife, the line
was rather long, and so they were provided chairs to await their turn in
Judgement. But these unfortunate spirits were more unfortunate still,
for they could not make up their minds on where to sit.
Apple refused to sit beside Cherry, whose breath (even in spirit) was
unimaginable in its putrescence.
Pinky and Apple declared that they must sit right beside each other
(they are twins, after all).
River and Violet declared that they must be as far apart as possible
(ex-lovers are always so picky).
Lastly, Oz’flob declared that she’d love to sit betwixt as much drama as
possible (living alone for so long can make you hungry for such gossip).
Some say these spirits are still there today, locked in eternal disagreement,
longing for a solution that will finally put their souls to rest.
Solution. Players must correctly arrange the colored urns
in the hearth following the proper square-circle pattern in
accordance with the logic puzzle. In this puzzle, Apple is the
green urn, Pinky is the magenta urn, Cherry is the red urn,
Violet is the purple urn, River is the blue urn, and Oz’flob
is the orange urn. Using this knowledge, the only correct
solution is the following:
```
1. Purple Urn (Violet, Square Bottom)
2. Green Urn (Apple, Round Bottom)
3. Magenta Urn (Pinky, Square Bottom)
4. Orange Urn (Oz’flob, Round Bottom)
5. Red Urn (Cherry, Square Bottom)
6. Blue Urn (River, Round Bottom)

```
Only once all urns are correctly placed is the puzzle
complete, the once-empty urns now fill with valuable
gems, potions of healing , or further clues towards something
elsewhere in the dungeon. The puzzle could also open a
secret door in the fireplace.
```
```
ı8. Aquatic Allies
An empty room or cavern is brightly lit with sconces, and
a 10-by-10 foot hole is roughly cut out of the floor. Next to
the hole rests a large glass bowl. Underneath the cutout is
another room entirely entirely with water, lapping at the
edges of the hole. 20 feet below the water’s surface, a school
of blue, luminescent koi are swimming to and fro. If anyone
dives into the water within 10 feet of the fish, they notice
that the creatures’ luminescence illuminates strange white
markings on the walls.
Solution. Characters must catch and bring at least one fish
above the surface. If a fish is brought above the surface
without being submerged in water, the fish immediately
stops glowing and shrivels, lifeless. Once exposed to air, the
fish cannot be revived or set aglow again. To keep the fish
glowing above water, it must remain submerged, either in
the glass bowl or another similar vessel.
When a glowing koi is brought to the walls of the upper
room, the markings revealed are too faint to read if the
sconces are still lit. Extinguishing all other lights in the
room except for one of the glowing koi allows any writing or
markings on the walls, floor, and ceiling to be easily visible.
These markings can provide clues to another relevant key
character or quest, directions to a hidden treasure (perhaps
in the pool below), or arrows pointing to specific portions
of the room that must be interacted with before revealing a
hidden passageway.
Secret Notes. This puzzle is a great way to introduce
luminescent koi and invisible writing as a mechanic for
further puzzles, or even an entire dungeon. Perhaps the next
room requires transporting a koi across a precarious gap
without exposing it to air. Perhaps the luminescent koi lets
the characters see a safe path drawn on the map of a room
filled with hidden traps. Characters could even receive a pot
of this invisible ink and a luminescent pendant as treasure
that allows them to use this mechanic themselves in the
future. The koi fish, so long as it is consistently fed and cared
for, could even be kept as a pet!

_- If calculated properly, The Liftomatic Vertical Transportation_
    _Device shall pause at the peak of its loft for lo 30-seconds before_
    _descending with gentility.
- Should thee be desirous to stoppeth upon a certain location whilst_
    _lofted within the shaft, whether thee be beyond the point thou_
    _intended to reacheth, or mayhaps thou calculated wrongly and_
    _undershotteth thine loft, pulleth the timed break lever, which_
    _shall locketh the platform in place for lo 30-seconds. The break_
    _lever may be reset, though if it is not, and additional loft has not_
    _been created in the arcanic elemental containment chamber, the_
    _Arcanic Liftomatic Vertical Transportation Device shall descend_
    _with gentility.
- Should thee be desirous of the creation of further loft, thou mayest_
    _pull thine timed break lever, set thine brazen tumblers to null, and_
    _input the elements thee require and proceedeth per usual directations._
**_- A Note of Warning Most Dire!_** _Should symbols_
    _inflammatory be input in series numbering greater than four, the_
    _elemental containment chamber shall be unable to contain the_
    _element and the Liftomatic Vertical Transportation Device will_
    _be engulfed in truly manifested element inflammatory._
**_Solution._** The solution to this puzzle is simply to read the
manual and make heads or tails of the controls.
To lift themselves 10 feet, the characters must input the
following on the tumblers: flame, water, air, null, null, null,
and null.
To lift themselves 20 feet, they must input the following:
flame, flame, water, water, air, null, null.
To lift themselves 30 feet, they must input the following:
flame, flame, flame, water, water, water, air.
**_Call the Lift._** Depending on how accessible you would like
this elevator to be, you can create panels at any upper-level
door to allow the platform to be called from above so long as
the operating procedures are remembered.
**_Holy Hand Grenade._** To enhance the comedic value of the
reading of the manual, the reader may read it in their best
quavering, pseudo-Shakespearean voice.

ı9. The Arcanic

Liftomatic Vertical

Transportation Device

A few steps lead up to a sliding door, inside which is a 15-by-
15-foot platform. The platform’s edge is surrounded by a
rail with hinged gates in the center of all its sides but one.
If a creature stands on the platform and looks up, they see
a vertical lift shaft rising high above them. Other doorways
open on the left shaft at certain points high above.

On the rail that does not have a hinged gate is a brass box
with 7 wheel-like cylindrical dials set into it. The dials have
four pictograms etched into them: a flame, a water droplet,
swirling air lines, and a simple dash line. Above each dial is a
small brass frame which indicates what pictogram ss selected.

Dangling from a chain beside the console is a battered
manual, the contents of which follow:

_Arcanic Liftomatic Vertical Transportation Device_

_- Do input the elements thee desire upon the brazen tumblers.
- Verily, ensureth thou hast input thine elements in the ord’r they_
    _shall be made manifest.
- Noteth that pow’r inflammatory in singular shall only beareth_
    _thee loft no more than ten spans of the standard foot of a human.
- Be thee ware that improp’r mixture of elements arcane may_
    _causeth unintended or grave consequences.
- Thine elements must remain with others of their kind, excepting_
    _only when transitioning unto a new set of elements. Once a_
    _contiguous group of elements has been created upon the brazen_
    _tumblers, further groups will be unable to be created.
- Should thee desire to loft thineselves above a height of ten spans of_
    _the standard human foot, thou must NOT alternate the elements_
    _inflammatory and aqueous repeating, for functioning shall cease.
- Elements thee may selecteth:_
    _- Inflammatory - Indicated by flame - Produces fire, heat,_
       _necessary for loft fuel._
    _- Aqueous - Indicated by droplet - Produces moisture, neces-_
       _sary for sustained lift._
    _- Zephyrous - Indicated by swirling lines - Produces air, lift,_
       _necessary for initial propulsion._
    _- Null - Indicated by a dash.

2 ı. For Whom the

```
Pyramid Rattles
A pyramid-shaped object roughly the size of a watermelon
is in this room. The pyramid is made of a lightweight metal
and has no seams or means to open it. A round, metallic-
sounding object can be heard and felt rolling around inside
the pyramid when it is tilted.
If the characters take the pyramid with them, eventually the
ball begins to rattle within the pyramid on its own. How long
it takes for the pyramid to start rattling is up to you. This
rattling can be heard up to 50 feet away, and is audible even
when the object is kept in an extra-dimensional space such
as a bag of holding. The rattling only stops when the pyramid
is held by a creature, who can feel that one of the corners of
the pyramid is warm to the touch.
Solution. The pyramid is reacting to the presence of a place
it needs to get to, getting warmer or colder as it gets closer or
further away. The built-in alarm activates once the pyramid
gets within range of the location.
Often, the characters will point the party towards
impassable terrain (large gaps, solid walls, etc.) leaving them
to determine the best path towards their destination. If the
pyramid is tracking an object instead of a location, and that
object moves feedback changes to match.
Once the characters reach the location or object (or even
creature) the pyramid is tracking, it rattles loudly for a few
seconds before falling silent and growing cold once more. The
tracked item could be a fragment of a whole object, whose
other pieces must be located elsewhere using the pyramid. It
could also be a special treasure, or even a person (such as the
creator of the object, or a key character in the campaign).
Testing. There is great potential for customization with this
puzzle, seeing as it operates around an object that players
must learn to utilize. Perhaps your pyramid features a
sentient or cursed ball in the center, or perhaps the pyramid
is one of a pair that can be used by party members to
communicate or track each other across long distances.
Is This Thing On? To increase the difficulty of the puzzle,
consider limiting the feedback of the pyramid by making
the entirety of it grow warmer or hotter depending on the
proximity of the target. You can also limit the temperature
feedback of the pyramid to simply “tepid”, “warm”, or “hot” to
remove the sliding scale of heat and further increase difficulty.
Which Way? Add more fun to the object-hunt by presenting
your players with gated choices at certain points along their
path. For example, perhaps the pyramid points them to a
room with two side-by-side doorways. When characters
select and enter a doorway, it closes and locks behind them,
now committing them to that path (which is either closer
or further from their goal). They can investigate the forked
paths for clues (footprints, debris, fur stuck in a door hinge,
etc.) that may also help them decide which direction to go.
```
20. Ancient Guardian of

```
the Hall
A hallway is almost entirely blocked by a large stone statue,
with but a few inches of space to spare on each side. The
statue can look like a cross-eyed goblin, a slack-jawed
ogre, or anything else exceptionally doofy-looking. When
approached, the statue shouts in an equally-doofy voice:
“I AM THE ANCIENT GUARDIAN OF THE HALL. NO ONE
GETS PAST, AND NO ONE EVER WILL, BECAUSE I’M A
REALLY GREAT GUARDIAN.”
Players can investigate the statue further, all while the
statue continues on loudly and incessantly about their hall-
guarding prowess. Below the statue is a small blackboard
plaque with the poorly-written words “Persuns Who Got
Pasd” displayed across the top. No names are written below
it. The statue will proudly call attention to this plaque as
evidence that no one has ever gotten by, because if they had,
their name would be on it.
Solution. There are many potential solutions to this puzzle
depending on the players’ approach. The easiest solution,
and the one that is hinted at the most, is for players to
simply write their names on the “Persuns Who Got Pasd”
plaque with chalk, a pencil, or even carved with a knife.
As they do this, the poor dumb statue will be positively
gobsmacked, and may even beg or bribe the characters to
stop writing their names before they finish. Unfortunately,
the statue will have no choice but to let the characters
through once they write each of their names on the plaque.
Other potential solutions may involve bribing the statue (“I
know of a really great, even BIGGER hall we could bring you
to for you to guard!”) or possibly lying to the statue (“You’ve
let us through before!” “We created you!”). Much of the fun
of this puzzle is interacting with players as this statue, and
allowing players’ outlandish plans to work on it, seeing as
the statue is delightfully dumb.
If your players do attack the statue, it has the stats of a
large animated object as created by a 5th-level animate object
spell (HP: 50, AC: 10, Attack: +6 to hit, 2d10 + 2 damage,
Movement Speed: 0ft).
```

Chapter Eleven | Perplexing Puzzles 155

23. Uplifting Words
Characters open a seemingly normal door into the middle of
a 15-foot square, 60-foot high shaft. On the far wall, across
from the entrance, the following proverb is painted:
_The hammer does pale when compared to the tongue.
To build and to break, there is no better one.
It is not of matter, but soul that we speak,
So forge with thine words, for the crop ye shall reap._
30 feet up from the proverb is a white door, flush with the
ceiling. 30 feet below is a black door, flush with the floor.
Although there are no visible or tangible walking surfaces,
characters can enter the room and seemingly walk on thin
air. However, they are unable to ascend or descend in the
shaft by normal means, such as climbing, jumping, or using
magic; each attempt results in the character being yanked
back to the invisible “floor” where they first stood.
**_Solution._** Each time a character compliments a fellow
party member, that character ascends 10 feet. Each time
a character insults a fellow party member, that character
descends 10 feet. This means, from the starting middle
ground, a character must give 3 compliments (30 feet) to
reach the top white door, or 3 insults (30 feet) to reach the
bottom black door.
Characters may discover a blessed item behind the white
door and a cursed item behind the black door, or perhaps
the doors are simply two entrances into the same location,
presented simply to reveal the character of those who
accessed them.
**_Have At You!_** You could take this idea to the extreme by
pairing this idea with combat. Perhaps the rules of the shaft
only affect the players, requiring them to shout niceties or
obscenities at each other mid-battle whilst trying to thwart
a flying enemy. Perhaps other speaking or sentient enemies
are beholden to the room’s rules as well, resulting in further
mayhem, and requiring you to hurl insults or compliments
as needed too!
22. Well-Read, Well-

Reasoned

Characters find an empty room with nine books laying
randomly scattered across the stone floor. Into the floor in
large letters is carved the following poem, with a few feet of
space between the stanzas:

_The space between awaits us,
Red, numbers, stares, and home_

_A clever placement wakes us,
Boys, embraces, fright, and stone_

_The magic happens at the end,
Then close your eyes and count to ten..._

**_Solution._** The solution to the puzzle is physically arranging
the books in order within the spaces between the stanzas.
Describe the books and their titles in a random order.

The books which should be laid out from left to right in the
space between stanzas one and two are:

**1. Red:** _Crimson Nightmare_ by Terrance Black
**2. Numbers:** _Our World As Understood in Mathematics_ by
    Harmony Sikh
**3. Stares:** _Warring Gazes_ by Bobson Loveleaf
**4. Home:** _The City Whence She Came_ by Tordwynn Aralance

The books which should be laid out from left to right in the
space between stanzas two and three are:

**5. Boys:** _Puberty in Young Male Half Orcs: A Study_ by Graak
    Hogthorn
**6. Embraces:** _Hold Me, Hardly_ by Elizabet Skylancer
**7. Fright:** _Tales to Tell After Twilight_ by Desdemona Reaper
**8. Stone:** _A Miner’s Guide to Minerals_ by Tokk Orlach

The book that should be placed at the end of the last stanza is:

**9. Magic:** _The Arcane Stairway_ (no author)

Once the books are arranged in this order, the entire party
must close their eyes and count to ten (per the poem’s
instructions). During this time, they hear the sound of
flipping pages and feel rushing wind on their faces. When
they open their eyes, the books have each grown to roughly
5 feet in length and have embedded themselves into a wall to
form an ascending staircase. The stairs can then be climbed
up through an illusory portion of the ceiling, where a hidden
library or other important location can be found.

**_Speed Read._** You should expect that characters will look
through the books. We encourage you to prepare or
improvise what the contents of the books might be.


156 Chapter Eleven | Perplexing Puzzles

25. “Meta” Magic
Characters find a small diorama in the center of an empty
room. The diorama is stuck to the floor, and is an exact
replica of the room the characters are currently in, as well
as the surrounding dungeon. The diorama even includes
strange, miniature figurines that seem to match the
character’s current positions, and move about as they do.
If a miniature figurine is moved on the board, the character
it represents is also moved a proportionate distance in the
room. No miniature figurine can be tilted or lifted from
the diorama — they may only be slid. In the same vein, if a
character jumps vertically or goes prone, their miniature
figurine remains unchanged. Miniature figurines cannot be
damaged or destroyed.
Creatures can take damage as normal from this movement
due to traps or dangers in their path. Creatures that want to
prevent this forced movement can make a DC15 Charisma
saving throw. If the creature fails, they are moved against
their will. If they succeed, they are unmoved, and their
connection to the miniature figurine is severed, preventing
them from being moved this way again.
**_Solution._** This puzzle concept has an infinite number of
applications and solutions depending on the campaign
and in-world location of the diorama. The following are
potential scenarios and solutions for this puzzle, which can
be adjusted or replaced with your own ideas:
    - Characters examining the diorama discover a hidden
       room with no entrance that can’t be seen or accessed in
       real life. Characters must find a way to carve a path in the
       diorama to make this room accessible; or, similarly, they
       may find a way to relocate the treasure within this hidden
       room to a separate accessible location in the dungeon.
    - Characters notice a room further into the dungeon with
       the lurking miniature figurines of sinister creatures.
       Under the same limitations of the characters’ figurines
       (no lifting, no laying down, cannot be destroyed) players
       must relocate, restrain, or otherwise clear a path
       through these creatures in order to advance. This can
       also be applied to disarming traps and clearing other
       map obstacles before advancing.
    - Characters notice a miniature in their current room
       of a hostile creature they can’t otherwise see or detect.
       Players must battle this creature, and may use their
       action to move themselves, allies, or the creature to
       another location using the diorama. If the creature is
       sentient and intelligent, it may even try to commandeer
       the diorama to use against the characters instead.
24. We Are as Water
This room is a 30-by-30 foot area with a 10-foot-wide
ledge of ice on one side, where the characters enter, and
a 10-foot-wide ledge of stone, covered in a thick haze of
steam. A 10-foot-wide river of water flows between the
ledges, running impossibly from a stone wall on one side of
the room to a dark stone tunnel on the other. If characters
investigate the icy area, steamy area, or water, they find
nothing out of the ordinary.
In the center of the river, a rowboat and oars is anchored
by a rope tied to a wooden stake in the ice. On the archway
above the river tunnel is a plaque engraved in elegant script:
_“We are as water, ever in three forms: who we were, who we are, and
who we will be.”_
If characters get in the boat and row through the tunnel,
they will emerge from the tunnel into the room they just left;
they see and feel nothing behind them but the stone wall.
They do, however, see a ghostly vision of their immediate
past selves on the ice, replaying from the moment they
initially entered the room until they rowed into the tunnel.
If any characters stayed behind without getting on the boat,
they do not see this vision, but they do see the boat phase
through the stone wall. Any subsequent passes through the
tunnel reveal the same thing.
**_Solution._** The icy portion of the room represents the
characters’ past, while the river portion of the room
represents the characters’ present. If characters enter the
steamy portion of the room after traveling through the
tunnel, they see another ghostly vision, presumably of their
future selves. This vision shows themselves lowering to the
floor to lay motionless in a fetal position. After a moment,
the vision melts through the stone floor and disappears. If
the characters follow this vision’s lead and curls into a fetal
position on the floor, they too will phase through the floor
and into a new area.
In this new area, or as they phase through to this area,
characters may have further dream-like visions of their past or
future selves, personalized and described at your discretion.
**_Be Creative._** This puzzle presents ample opportunity for
adjustment to suit your party’s needs. Especially since the
players will likely try many things outside of the “correct”
solution, you can think of many other ways to reward
their creativity with additional visions or discoveries. For
example, what if players try to break through the stone wall
from which the river mysteriously originates, or they try to
travel backwards through it? What if players try to stop or
turn around in the middle of the dark river tunnel — would
they discover anything?
You don’t need answers to every possibility right from
the start, but leave yourself open to having fun and being
creative with your responses to your players’ efforts.


Chapter Eleven | Perplexing Puzzles 157

27. Short and Sweet
The space is a room of any particular size, but cluttered with
things in some degree of disarray. On the wall hangs a large
picture frame as tall as a person. The painting inside the
frame is flat black.
Notable items found amongst the clutter in are:
    - An ant farm
    - A journal lying next to the ant farm
    - A sack containing a large amount of dried meat.
    - A rough and slightly misshapen 3-by-3-foot, 6-foot tall
       block of sugar under a tarp.
    - A small chisel and hammer nearby.
    - A small workbench with alchemical tools and a wooden
       crate of small brown glass bottles labeled “ant repellent,
       not ale.”
    - A round, metal shield that looks like it was almost shorn
       in half by massive jaws.
**_Solution._** An item the characters seek has been hidden inside
the ant farm. Any creature stepping through the frame exits
a Tiny frame within the ant farm, stepping out onto a small
area of stone. The stone is carved with wards which prevent
the ants from approaching the frame and escaping. Beyond
the stone, is a typical ant farm.
Creatures inside the ant farm appear Tiny to those outside
it, but they are their normal size relative to other creatures
inside the ant farm. The ants in the farm are highly
territorial and attack intruders.
The journal describes the room’s owner using the ant farm
as a place to store valuables. He discovered that his ants were
temperamental, and he tried several things to deal with them
including homebrewed ant repellant, dried meat, and sugar.
The ant repellant doesn’t work at all. Instead, it enrages any
ants in the immediate area until the characters flees.
The ants quickly devour the dried meat, but it does nothing
to make them more friendly. The sugar, however, makes ants
who eat it friendly towards the characters.
28. Stoned
In the center of the room is a large, simple clay pot
surrounded by beautiful colored stones. A creature who
picks up a stone is unable to speak, unable to release the
stone, and cannot pick up another stone.
Each stone telepathically whispers a particular requirement
to the mind of the creature who picks it up, and meeting this
requirement allows the creature to drop the stone.
The conditions for each stone are:
    **- Red**. You must take 5 hit points of damage while holding
       the stone, then you may place it in the pot.
    **- Orange**. You must place your stone in the shoe of a
       fellow party member, and place the shoe in the pot.
26. ‘Tis the Season

Characters enter a 15-by-15 foot room that is unnaturally
brimming with springtime atmosphere. The floor of the
room is covered in grass, flowers, and foliage. Sunlight
streaks through rain clouds that drift and drizzle from the
ceiling, 25 feet above.

In the center of the grassy floor sits a 1-inch square metal
box. The box is nearly impossible to break open in its current
state, though something can be heard brushing against the
inside of it. In the back right corner of the room is a 5-by-5
foot square patch of tilled, unused farming soil. On the far
left corner of the room is an unlocked metal door.

Past this initial room are three more nearly identical rooms,
each which embody the seasons of summer, autumn, and
winter. The summer room is cloudless, bright, hot, and
flooded with the scent of summery earth and flowers. The
metal box in the summer room is hot to the touch. The
autumn room is slightly chilly with crunchier, browning
grass, and is filled with a sourceless breeze that wafts through
it. This room’s metal box shows the beginnings of rust, but is
still very difficult to open. The winter room is very cold, coated
in a layer of snow that drifts slowly down from the clouds
above. The metal box in this room is thoroughly rusted and
looks easier to open. Unlike the other rooms, the door at the
back of the winter room is locked, has no handle, and sports a
deep, half-circle indent in its center, a bit larger than a fist.

**_Solution._** The metal box can be opened in any room, but it’s
hardest to open in summer and easiest to open in winter. It
contains a 6-inch tree sapling, and once the box is opened in
one room it is opened in all rooms.

Characters can then plant the seed in the farming soil in
the spring room. Nothing happens immediately, but in the
winter room there is no a 4-foot tall tree of the same kind
as the sapling. Removing this tree and replanting it in the
spring room, makes a large, fruit-bearing tree appear in
the autumn room. Characters can then take this fruit to the
winter room, place it into the circular indent on the door,
and the door will open.

What lies beyond the door could be a bounty of mystical fruits
and vegetables, or perhaps a portal to another location or plane
that is similarly governed by the quick shifting of seasons.

**_Remembering the Past._** The core concept of this room
could instead be used to provide interesting opportunities
for roleplay with the players. Perhaps key events in your
characters’ lives occurred in a particular season, creating
a ripe atmosphere for flashbacks or plot advancement. It’s
also possible that the rooms don’t culminate in a locked
door at all, but simply serve as a physical representation of
characters’ journey thus far.

30. A Lasting Impression
The characters enter an ancient, dusty room built entirely
from roughly-carved sandstone bricks. Each of these bricks
has carvings that resemble rudimentary hieroglyphics or
early pictographs. The pictographs on certain bricks depict
religious rituals, interactions with gods, famous wars, and
prophetic stories.
One corner of a wall has crumbled, leaving an empty space
where six bricks used to be. Six sandstone bricks lay on the
floor beneath the crumbled portion of wall, though they are
strangely pristine and have an aura of transmutation magic
visible with _detect magic_. The bricks look like they cover an
empty space of wall with the words “tell your story” carved
roughly into it.
**_Solution._** Using a knife, chisel, or other tool, characters must
recreate six of their previous adventures, accomplishments,
or memorable encounters on the fallen bricks. They must
then place these bricks into the crumbled portion of the
wall, filling the hole. The bricks then glow with a soft white
light as they become part of the wall.
Across the room, a different section of bricks shifts
outwards to reveal a 2-by-2 foot section of stone wall with
a strange, stony face carved into it. The face speaks to the
characters, thanking them for their stories and rewarding
them with a story in return: any single one of the stories they
find depicted somewhere else in the room.
After the retelling, the face asks the characters to return
someday with more stories, promising to reward them once
more with it’s knowledge. Finally, the bricks shift back into
place, covering the face, and the corner section of bricks
crumbles once more, the characters’ stories erased from the
brick faces.
**_We Have to Draw?_** It is highly recommended that you
require your players to actually draw their chosen memory
or adventure on an index-card-sized piece of paper. Even
if you are playing remotely, have players draw their brick
face and send a picture of it to you and the gaming crew!
The worse the drawing, the better, trust us. You can even get
them framed afterwards to have a lifelong memory of your
campaign and its wild adventures!
**_Years and Years._** You can provide a more concrete reward for
this puzzle. When the characters finish placing their bricks
into the wall, the floor starts to shudder, then slowly descends.
Describe how the brick walls continue downward as the
floor lowers, depicting thousands more stories on the bricks,
perhaps ones that grow more dark or sinister as they continue
down. Eventually, the characters find themselves in a secret
underground tomb or tunnel system long forgotten by time.
**- Yellow**. You must get every party member to give you a
hug. The stone can then be placed into the pot.
**- Green**. You must have no currency on your person or
within your belongings. Once you have no coin in your
possession, the stone can then be placed into the pot.
**- Blue**. You must douse any sources of light in the room.
The stone may then be placed in the pot.
**- Purple**. Your stone can only be placed into the pot while
you are upside-down (feet above your head).
**- Black.** You must make someone kneel on both knees and
bow to you. Once someone does, you may put your stone
in the pot.
**- White.** Get the rest of your party to leave the room.
Once you are alone, you may put your stone in the pot.
**_Solution._** The puzzle is solved once every party member has
taken a stone and fulfilled its requirement. This may mean
that sealed exits open, treasure is revealed, or clues can be
found. Once the puzzle has been solved, the stones placed in
the pot magically return to their original locations, and any
personal items removed to fulfill the stone’s requirements
are magically returned.
**_We All Have to Get Stoned._** The puzzle might require that
every member of the party take a stone, even those who are
not in the room. This might mean some or all of the characters
who are in the room need to leave, find the others, and come
back with them. Having one hand occupied with a stone may
impede a character’s ability to use weapons or cast spells.
**_Where’s the Pot?_** For an even greater challenge, the stones
may be found separate from the clay pot, and perhaps even
separate from each other.
29. Mean Muggin’
Within the tavern, 3 humanoids sit at a table, one Large, one
Medium, and one Small.
The tavernkeep says:
_“‘Ey, c’mere. You wanna play a bit of a game? See those three? Them’s
regulars ‘n’ they order the same thing every night. Here’s the game:
“These here are their drinks.”_ He puts three drinks on the bar.
_Three of you each grab a drink, and you take the drinks t’ them at the
same time. They get the right drinks, they won’t start no rukus. Give
‘em the wrong drinks, and they’re like t’ fight.
“They get the right drinks, you get rooms, food and drinks on the
house. Any of ‘em fights, you pay full price, and buy a round for those
three and everyone else in here. Whaddaya say?”_
There are three clay mugs on the bar, each with different
contents: water, sweet mead, and fire whiskey. The patrons
are at their table, sober.
The Large humanoid seems perfectly happy at the moment,
but starts a fight if given mead or whiskey.
The Medium humanoid is eating some spicy food, and
sweat is beading on his forehead. They want whisky, and get
belligerent if given water. Mead makes them start a fight.


Chapter Twelve | Subtle Secrets 159

SUBTLE SECRETS

Adding depth, mystery, and intrigue to an adventure can
be the difference between a good campaign and a great
one. Storytelling usually benefits from keeping a bit of
information being from the main characters and then
revealing that information at the moment that gives the best
dramatic effect. This could be something as important as a
relationship between the main antagonist and the heroes
(such as the villain being one of the hero’s blood relatives) or
something more mundane, like a secret escape tunnel out of
the final chamber of the dungeon.

Characters can learn these secrets by seeking out learned
scholars or ancient creatures that might know obscure
facts. They can also pour over books, scrolls, and runes
on dungeon walls. Dreams, visions, flashbacks, and other
magical occurrences can also yield useful information.

Each of these methods requires a different approach. Wisdom
and Charisma-based skills such as Insight, Persuasion, and
Intimidation are useful when dealing with other creatures.
When searching for written secrets, Intelligence-based skills
like History and Religion are appropriate. For supernatural

```
occurrences, Wisdom and Intelligence-based skills such as
Arcana, Insight, and Investigation are useful, depending on
the nature of the occurrence.
Hidden information can be broken down into three categories:
story secrets, quest secrets, and environment secrets.
```
```
Story Secrets
Story secrets include things having to do with the
overarching campaign and the characters’ roles within it.
The noble who gives the characters their quest to rid the
land of vampires is himself a vampire. Two characters find
out that they are actually half-siblings and share a psychic
connection. The entire planet has a giant dragon slumbering
inside of it. These are all secrets that could change the
characters or how they relate to the world of your campaign.
The best way to give out these secrets is slowly, as clues to
a larger puzzle. Each piece helps to form a clearer picture
of the whole secret. Better still, but more challenging,
is to leave a trail of clues that lead the characters to the
wrong conclusion. Then, when the final clue is in place, the
revelation comes as a shock.
```

160 Chapter Twelve | Subtle Secrets

```
Here are some example story secrets to inspire you in your
own storytelling:
```
- The person setting the characters on their journey is
    actually a blood relative of the antagonist, though they
    may or may not know it. The closer the relationship, the
    more impactful the final reveal.
- A powerful noble and several of their colleagues are
    secretly vampires, lycanthropes, or some other accursed
    creature. One member of this group wants to eliminate
    the others to gain power and eliminate the only people
    who know their horrible secret.
- One of the characters is either vulnerable or immune
    to the main antagonist’s signature ability. The reason
    for this unique situation might be a magical blessing
    or curse, a twist of fate, or some other quirk of your
    campaign’s setting.
- The dragon who is thought to guard the treasure died a
    long time ago, but it's skeletal remains still lurk in its lair.
- The individuals who hired the characters are actually
    members of a different faction opposed to the one they
    claim to represent.
- The characters aren’t expected to succeed or even
    survive on their adventure, but instead to act as a
    distraction while another group accomplishes its goal.

```
Quest Secrets
Quest secrets pertain to specific tasks within an adventure
itself. These could be the location of a map the characters
need to begin the next leg of their journey, a secret password
to open a chest that contains the artifact they need to
proceed, or learning that touching the glowing orb on the
pedestal will instantly disintegrate someone who is not the
chosen one.
Here are some example quest secrets to inspire you in your
own storytelling:
```
- If they want to release the captive creature from its
    magical bonds, the characters must replace it with
    someone else.
- The lock that foiled the characters is enchanted with
    _arcane lock_ , requiring a specific key or a _knock_ spell.
- The object at the center of the characters’ quest can
    only be touched by a creature of a particular bloodline,
    a creature wearing a particular ring, or a creature in
    possession of a particular enchanted item.
- Over the years, many replicas of the item the characters
    are searching for have been made. Only the version with
    a specific maker’s mark is the original.
       - An unassuming creature, whether ally or adversary,
          connected to the characters’ journey is secretly very
          powerful and not to be underestimated. This reveal
          should be sudden and dramatic.
       - The antagonist may only be defeated by a specific
          person, spell, element, item, etc. This could also
          be a specific location where the antagonist can be
          defeated such as a particular building, environment, or
          dimension.

```
Environmental Secrets
Environmental secrets can be a compartment in a desk, a
false wall in an alchemy lab, or a hatch in the floor under
the rug. Often these types of secrets are related to a simple
or complex trap. Stepping in the wrong place, opening the
wrong door, and picking up an object might all trigger a trap.
In many cases, characters stumble over environmental
secrets by accident; detecting a faint draft through a crack
that reveals a hidden passageway, looking up at the perfect
moment to notice a lever on the ceiling, accidentally falling
down a pit trap to discover the next level of the dungeon.
Here are some examples of environmental secrets to inspire
you in your own storytelling:
```
- Stepping through a mirror is the only way to reach the
    next level of the dungeon.
- A secret passageway connects an early section of the
    dungeon with a deeper area. The hidden doors of the
    passageway can only be opened from the deeper area.
- A chest has a secret compartment that can be accessed
    from the inside by pressing on a release mechanism.
- A password or command word for a magical device is
    written on the back of the tapestry.
- An illusion hides a door or passageway.
- Grooves on the floor, left by a trap, are revealed only
    when light hits the tiles at a particular angle.


Chapter Thirteen | Ridiculous Riddles 161

RIDICULOUS RIDDLES

Riddles are questions or verbal puzzles that are presented
so as to be cryptic or indirect, while still seeking a specific
answer. Consider the classic “Riddle of the Sphinx” found in
Greek mythology:

_What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs in the afternoon,
three legs in the evening, and no legs at night?_

The answer, as most people know, is “a human,” or “people.”

The riddle is a test of the ability to avoid overly literal
thinking, and to think figuratively. It would be very easy to
simply ask “What crawls at the beginning of its life, walks
on two legs after that, and later uses a cane, and then dies?”
The point is to test the cleverness of the listener.

```
G  R D
Here are some guidelines for creating riddles:
```
1. It should be solvable.
2. It must provide the necessary information.
3. It should have only one answer
4. Have clues ready.
Now we’ll elaborate on these various points.


162 Chapter Thirteen | Ridiculous Riddles

```
IT SHOULD BE SOLVABLE!
Riddles and brain teasers can either make players feel
wonderful and clever, or stupid and frustrated. There is also
something about sitting around playing a tabletop RPG,
or playing a game with a group, that can turn an otherwise
clever individual’s brain to mush. Here are some things that
can impact one’s ability to solve riddles at the table:
```
- The pressure of other people watching
- Distractions
- Having the input of other individuals or solving as a
    committee
- If the players must remain “in character” while they try
    to solve the riddle
- In-game pressure (such as a character’s life depending
    on a correct answer)
Because of these (and, very likely, many other reasons not
mentioned here), it is important to remember that you, the
GM, **_want_** the players to solve your riddle! If you make it
too hard, it is almost inevitable that they will be stuck there
all night (or worse, multiple _sessions_ ). As a general rule, the
riddle will always be at least one degree harder for your
group than it is for you, if not two. If you think your riddle is
hard, expect it to be **_very_** hard for your players. If you think
your riddle is easy, expect it to be moderately difficult (which
is exactly the range that’s generally best to aim for, unless
your group is a bunch of hardened riddle-breakers).

```
IT MUST PROVIDE THE NECESSARY
INFORMATION
The contents of the riddle must be sufficient to reveal the
answer on their own, to a reasonable degree. For instance,
with our Sphynxian example, the riddle does not state
“man” or “a human” (or, in the case of fantasy RPGs, perhaps
it would be human oid ?). However, it is reasonable to think
that someone is aware of their own species and how the
flow of life tends to work. It is knowledge that the subject is
guaranteed to have. The riddle just forces them to realize the
connection between the abstract clue they were given, and
the firm information locked in their own minds.
```
```
THE ANSWER SHOULD BE THE ONLY ONE
Good riddles have a way of giving the solver that “Ah HA!”
moment, because there should be only one answer. When
the solver lands on an idea, they can check it by asking
themselves, “Does my idea meet the criteria of the riddle?”
If the answer is a firm “yes” for all points of the riddle, that
should be the answer.
```
```
Having said that, designing riddles can be difficult and,
unless you’re an expert at it, you might make a riddle that
can be answered by something that you didn’t expect. If the
answer given by the players perfectly fits the criteria of the
riddle, it is important to accept it. It will make the players
feel extremely clever and the game will keep moving.
```
```
HAVE CLUES READY
Players will get stumped sometimes and it is important to
be ready to give clues. This is an excellent opportunity to use
ability checks pertaining to what characters know or have
encountered before. Make sure that the clue is just a clue, and
not the entire answer.
```
```
EXCEPTIONS
Coming up with a riddle can be an amorphous, tricky, and
confusing thing to do, even when you have guidelines like
these to help. Sometimes the guidelines may even steer
you away from where your mind wants to go. If you get
inspired and come up with something that doesn’t follow
the guidelines, but still works, great! Even in the examples
below, you will find some that may not quite fit what’s above,
but they are still fun. Follow your inspiration and practice,
practice, practice.
```
GENERAL TIPS

- Think of things with multiple meanings, such as an
    object or commonly used word or phrase.
- Use a simple rhyme scheme such as one of the following:
- Every line rhymes (go for similar syllable pacing in the
    sentences).
- Every other line rhymes (first with third, second with
    fourth, etc).
- Limerick (five lines; first, second and fifth rhyme, third
    and fourth rhyme).
- Limit your lines; simpler is better.

TRAPSMITH LEGENDS
The trapsmith is a clever, cunning, and devious creator of
obstacles and impediments. In this chapter, you will find
information on the trapsmith background, as well as three
trapsmith NPCs who can accompany an adventuring party
on their journeys, for the right price.
Trapsmith Background. The trapsmith is proficient
in building and disarming traps, and has the tools and
knowledge to do so. This background comes with a unique
set of equipment, features, and characteristics, all suited to
the dungeon-delving experience.
NPCs & Hirelings. For those facing an especially
challenging dungeon  full of scything blades, pitfalls, and
fire blasts at every turn  there are folk who make a good
living acting as guides through such treacherous places.
```
```
Trapsmith
You love traps and you always have. The satisfaction when
something comes together just right is a feeling you’re very
familiar with. You have always enjoyed tinkering with things
and finding ways to defend your home or place of business
with dangerous devices. You understand that traps can be,
and often are, harmful but you treat your profession with
```
```
some degree of ethics, depending on whether or not you
consider the potential victims of your traps to be deserving
of their fate.
Skill Proficiencies : Perception, plus your choice of one of
the following: Arcana, Investigation, Sleight of Hand, or
Survival.
Tool Proficiencies : Thieves’ tools, trapmaker's tools*
Equipment: A set of tough, rugged clothing, a set of
trapmaker’s tools*, a small boot knife, string, a wooden
hammer, box of 50 1-inch iron nails, a small envelope
holding 15 hollow needles, a thimble, a round leather scroll
case containing 10 pieces of parchment, 5 small pieces of
writing charcoal, a spool of wire, a spool of thin braided
rope, a spring, a pulley, and a pouch containing 5 gp.
Feature: Professional Courtesy. When you come into
contact with other trap makers with whom you share a
language, you can talk shop. When you do this, you have a
better chance of building professional rapport. At the GM’s
discretion, this might shift them away from being hostile,
provide you a discount on materials, or they may decide to
do you a small favor.
```

Channel Divinity (2/Short Rest). As an action, Berf can
channel divinity (DC 14) to create one of the following effects:
```
_- Turn Undead._ Each undead that can see or hear Berf must
    make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its
    saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute, or until it takes
    damage.
    A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move
    as far away from Berf as it can, and it can’t willingly
    move to a space within 30 feet of him. It also can’t take
    reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action,
    or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from
    moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use
    the Dodge action.
    When an undead fails its saving throw against Berf’s
    Turn Undead feature, it is instantly destroyed if its CR is
    lower than 1.
_- Knowledge of the Ages._ Berf gains proficiency in any skill,
    or with any tool, for 10 minutes.
       _- Read Thoughts._ Berf chooses one creature that he can
          see within 60 feet of him. That creature must make a
          Wisdom saving throw. If the creature succeeds on the
          saving throw, Berf can’t use this feature on it again until
          he finishes a long rest.
          If the creature fails its save, Berf can read its surface
          thoughts when it is within 60 feet of him. This effect
          lasts for 1 minute. During that time, Berf can use an
          action to end this effect and cast the _suggestion_ spell on
          the creature without expending a spell slot. The target
          automatically fails its saving throw against the spell.
       **_Dwarven Combat Training._** Berf has proficiency with bat-
       tleaxes, handaxes, light hammers, and warhammers.
       **_Dwarven Resilience._** Berf has advantage saving throws
       against poison.
       **_Spellcasting._** Berf is a 9th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting
       ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell
       attacks). Berf has the following cleric spells prepared:
       - Cantrips (at will): _guidance_ , _light_ , _mending_ , _thaumaturgy_
       - 1st level (4 slots): _bless_ , _command_ , _identify_
       - 2nd level (3 slots): _augury_ , _suggestion_
       - 3rd level (3 slots): _nondetection_ , _speak with dead_
       - 4th level (3 slots): _arcane eye_ , _confusion_
       - 5th level (1 slot): _legend lore_ , _scrying_
       **_Stonecunning._** Whenever Berf makes an Intelligence (History)
       check related to the origin of stonework, he is considered
       proficient in the History skill, and has +9 to his roll.

```
ACTIONS
Mace. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit with, reach 5 ft., one

Chapter Fourteen | Trapsmith Legends 167

O

Berf Barbender is an old dwarf cleric with a craggy, grizzled
appearance; he wears a long, red waistcoat with big brass
buttons. He is knowledgeable about religious artifacts, the
locations where they might be stored, and the traps that
might protect them. On his back, Berf carries a massive
pack filled with all manner of trap detecting and disarming
devices. He has the tools and skills to handle just about any
type of trap, but even he will admit that he’s not a master
of any particular type; more of a generalist. Very few people
know that he is a cleric; he keeps his holy symbol covered,
and only reveals it in the most dire of circumstances.

dungeon in search of a lost relic.

Berf is a bit reckless at times; a few people may be lost along
the way, but the rewards might be worth it.

B

Berf regrets putting his former partner in a dangerous
situation, one that led to their death.

F

The desire to see what’s beyond the horizon has gotten Berf
into trouble more than once.

R	 B

Berf says what he thinks and lacks any subtly with his words.
He is one of the toughest dwarves you’ll ever encounter, with
the stamina of someone half his age. He tries to make everyone
around him think he doesn’t get scared or feel pain but, deep
down, even he has a breaking point.

Arcane Recovery (1/Day). When Izzy finishes a short rest,
she can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell
slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than 7,
and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.
Artificer’s Lore. Whenever Izzy makes an Intelligence
(History) check related to magic items, alchemical objects, or
technological devices, she adds +15 to her roll.
Empowered Evocation. Izzy can add her Intelligence
modifier (+5) to one damage roll of any wizard evocation
spell she casts.
Gnome Cunning. Izzy has advantage on all Intelligence,
Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.
Potent Cantrip. Izzy’s damaging cantrips affect even
creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature
succeeds on a saving throw against her cantrip, the creature
takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no
additional effect from the cantrip.
Sculpt Spell. Izzy can create pockets of relative safety
within the effects of her evocation spells. When she casts
an evocation spell that affects other creatures that she can
see, she can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s
level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their
saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if
they would normally take half damage on a successful save.
```
```
Spellcasting. Izzy is a 13th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting
ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell
attacks). Izzy has the following wizard spells prepared:
```
- Cantrips (at will): _dancing lights_ , _mage hand_ , _mending_ ,
    _minor illusion_ , _prestidigitation_
- 1st level (4 slots): _detect magic, mage armor, feather fall,_
    _floating disk_
- 2nd level (3 slots): _knock, levitate, locate object, shatter_
- 3rd level (3 slots): _dispel magic, gaseous form, lightning bolt_
- 4th level (3 slots): _arcane eye, dimension door, wall of fire_
- 5th level (2 slots): _cone of cold, passwall_
- 6th level (1 slot): _true seeing_
- 7th level (1 slot): _antimagic field_
**_Tinker._** Using her tinker’s tools, Izzy can spend 1 hour and 10
gp worth of materials to construct a Tiny clockwork device
(AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours
(unless she spends 1 hour repairing it to keep the device
functioning), or when she uses her action to dismantle it; at
that time, she can reclaim the materials used to create it. She
can have up to three such devices active at a time. When she
creates a device, she chooses one of the following options:
**_- Clockwork Toy._** This toy is a clockwork animal, monster,
or person, such as a frog, mouse, bird, dragon, or
soldier. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet
across the ground on each of Izzy’s turns in a random
direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature
it represents.
**_- Fire Starter._** The device produces a miniature flame,
which Izzy can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire.
Using the device requires her action.
**_- Music Box._** When opened, this music box plays a single
song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when
it reaches the song’s end, or when it is closed.

```
ACTIONS
Dagger. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft. or
range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) piercing damage.

Chapter Fourteen | Trapsmith Legends 169

O

Izzy Freeleaf is a 29-year-old gnome wizard, and an expert
when it comes to identifying and overcoming magical traps.
She takes great pride in her unique set of skills, as well as
her ability to use magic to simply bypass traps in clever
ways. She is tall and slender (for a gnome), with a rosy pink
complexion and silvery-white hair. She wears fine clothing
and rarely gets her hands dirty.

P	 T

If Izzy gets dirty (literally or figuratively), then she has done
a poor job. Izzy works smart, not hard.

I

Izzy strives for perfection and the best possible outcomes in
all aspects of her life.

B

Izzy does what she does because she loves the challenge and
the feeling of accomplishment it gives her. The money is
simply a necessity.

F 

When something goes wrong, Izzy immediately tries to
assign blame, even if it is with herself. She has a difficult
time letting go of failure.

R	 I

	

Izzy is a somewhat frantic gnome who is obsessive about
cleanliness and efficiency. Despite the manner in which she
works, her spellcasting and her work with traps is perfect
almost every time. She holds herself accountable for any
failures, often to her detriment.

```
“Yes! That’s the ticket!”
```
WEAPONS, ARMOR & ITEMS

Component pouch, spellbook (containing all the spells
she has prepared, plus the following: _arcane eye_ , _arcane lock_ ,
_fabricate_ , and _secret chest_ ), a set of tough, rugged clothing, a set
of trapmaker’s tools*, a small boot knife, string, a wooden
hammer, box of 50 1-inch iron nails, a small envelope
holding 15 hollow needles, a thimble, a round leather scroll
case containing 10 pieces of parchment, 5 small pieces of
writing charcoal, a spool of wire, a spool of thin braided
rope, a spring, a pulley, and a pouch containing 5 gp.

```
REACTIONS
Uncanny Dodge. When an attacker that Max can see hits him
with an attack, he can use his reaction to halve the attack’s
damage against him.
```
```
O
Max Rosewater is a 39-year-old human rogue with a focus on
the detection, disarming and circumvention of non-magical
traps. He’s run into magical traps enough to know to look out
for them, but he hasn’t quite figured out good ways to deal
with them. Though he may seem rough around the edges at
first glance, he is actually quite the gentleman and highly
respected in low places. He has a wiry build and wears his
favorite leather armor which is tattered, but very comfortable.
```
```
P	 T
Max loves meeting new people and hearing about their lives.
He’s even got some tales of his own!
```
```
I
Max is never too proud for anything. He’ll work with anyone,
so long as they do their part.
```
```
B
Max once failed in disarming a trap, which then got the
entire team he was with killed. Max barely escaped, and has
never fully been able to forgive himself.
```
```
F 
Max can be overly cautious, and sometimes take too long to
do a thing. He gets irritated if he gets rushed.
```
```
R	 M
Max will take on almost any job he’s offered. He is a sucker
for tall tales and scintillating stories, and has plenty
of his own to share. Despite this, he sometimes
becomes melancholy while reflecting on his
past. A tragedy killed many of his friends, and
he holds himself to blame. This makes him
extremely cautious while on the job.
“Steady now. Don’t rush me...”

Cunning Action. Max can take a bonus action on each of his
turns to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.
Fast Hands. Max can use the bonus action granted by his
Cunning Action to make a Sleight of Hand check, use his
thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use
an Object action.
Sneak Attack (1/Turn). Max can deal an extra 10 (3d6) damage
to one creature he hits with an attack with a finesse or ranged
weapon, if he has advantage on the attack roll. He doesn’t
need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the
target is within 5 ft. of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and
he doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.
Second-Story Work. Climbing no longer costs Max extra
movement and, when he makes a running jump, the
distance he covers increases by 4 feet.
Thieves’ Cant. During his rogue training, Max learned thieves’
cant, a secret mix of dialect, jargon, and code that allows him
to hide messages in seemingly normal conversation. Only
another creature that knows thieves’ cant understands such
messages. It takes four times longer to convey such a message
than it does to speak the same idea plainly.
In addition, Max understands a set of secret
signs and symbols used to convey short,
simple messages, such as whether an area is
dangerous, in the territory of a thieves’ guild,
loot is nearby, the people in an area are easy
marks, or whether they will provide a safe
house for thieves on the run.
