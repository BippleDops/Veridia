  "revised_prompt": "A heroic fantasy scene in the style of tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons. The materials are grounded in medieval-fantasy, with culturally coherent gear and devoid of modern technological elements. The scene represents a reality fracture, merging different zones, providing a clear focal point in the narrative. Atmospheric visual effects enhance the scene's cinematic look with specifically shaped lights illuminating the high-fidelity illustrated setting. The scene is also inspired by an aquatic fantasy realism with subsurface caustics and bioluminescent accents. Materials akin to pressure-dome structures form part of this underwater fantasy. The color palette is dominated by teals, deep blues, sea-greens, and pearl highlights. The scene should portray an aspect/resolution with no artifacts. The scene is devoid of any readable signage or paragraphs, keeping any symbols meaningful or using numbered pins. The scene avoids any sci-fi UIs, modern signage, photoreal CGI, anime style, and bloom glare.",
