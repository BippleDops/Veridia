Understanding these strategies provides insight into community resilience and alternative economic systems that exist alongside formal markets. ## Lore Details Community elders speak of the "Economy of Hearts" - a theoretical system where value is determined by emotional and social need rather than monetary exchange. They claim that communities operating under this system become more prosperous than those driven by individual profit, despite having less money. Deep-sea community historians maintain that extreme pressure creates physical manifestations of community bonds, making mutual aid networks literally visible as connections between community members. They argue that communities with strong survival networks create protective auras that shield members from environmental dangers. ## DM Notes Use poverty survival strategies as examples of community resilience and alternative economic thinking. These systems can provide adventure hooks involving moral complexity, community organizing, and economic justice issues. Consider how poverty survival strategies challenge assumptions about individual versus community responsibility for economic welfare. Characters may encounter very different ideas about property, sharing, and economic obligation. The sophisticated nature of community survival strategies demonstrates that poverty communities are not passive victims but active agents creating solutions to systemic problems. This can lead to adventures involving community organizing, alternative economic development, and social justice advocacy. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
