--- # Malnutrition

*Generic Hazard* A creature needs an amount of food per day based on its size, as shown in the Food Needs per Day table. A creature that eats but consumes less than half the required food for a day must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution [[Death Saving Throw Xphb]] or gain 1 [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] level at the day's end. A creature that eats nothing for 5 days automatically gains 1 [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] level at the end of the fifth day as well as an additional level at the end of each subsequent day without food. [[conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] caused by malnutrition can't be removed until the creature eats the full amount of food required for a day. **Food Needs per Day** | Size | Food |
|------|------|
| Tiny | 1/4 pound |
| Small | 1 pound |
| Medium | 1 pound |
| Large | 4 pounds |
| Huge | 16 pounds |
| Gargantuan | 64 pounds |

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of malnutrition xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around malnutrition xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
