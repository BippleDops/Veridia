# Mace of Terror
*Weapon ([[mace xphb|mace]]), rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/mace-of-terror.webp#right)

- **Damage**: 1d6 bludgeoning
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This magic weapon has 3 charges and regains `d3` expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the weapon, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror from it. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the [[conditions#frightened|Frightened]] condition for 1 minute. While [[conditions#frightened|Frightened]] in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't make [[actions#Opportunity%20Attack|Opportunity Attacks]]. For its action, it can use only the [[actions#Dash|Dash]] action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can take the [[actions#Dodge|Dodge]] action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
