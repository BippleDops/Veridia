## Description
The easily portable bullseye lantern is the friend of many an adventuring band. My fine bullseye [[Lanterns|lanterns]] have [[Metal|metal]] housings with panels of glass to keep wind away from the flame. The [[Metal|metal]] is polished on the inside to reflect light outward in a funneled path. A shutter (included) can be set in place over the glass to block out the light. This bullseye is equipped with adjustable vents to regulate airflow, and thus the brightness and longevity of the flame and heat of the lantern (12 gp).

## Additional Details
Even when the shutter is closed, some light still escapes from the lantern. Closing off every crack in the lantern’s assembly would quickly extinguish the flame. Adventurers must remember that even if the shutter is closed, the lantern will shed enough light to give away their position in a dark dungeon. A bullseye lantern’s light reaches 60 feet, with an additional 20 feet of semidarkness. A bullseye lantern burns six hours per pint [[Canteen|flask]] of oil, and holds one pint.
