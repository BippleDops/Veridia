# Periapt of Proof against Poison
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  


- **Weight**: 1.0 lbs.

This delicate silver chain has a brilliant-cut black gem pendant. While you wear it, you have [Immunity](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to the [Poisoned](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition and Poison damage
