# Silvery Barbs
*1st-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Reaction
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You magically distract the triggering creature and turn its momentary uncertainty into encouragement for another creature. The triggering creature must reroll the `d20` and use the lower roll.

You can then choose a different creature you can see within range (you can choose yourself). The chosen creature has advantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes within 1 minute. A creature can be empowered by only one use of this spell at a time.
