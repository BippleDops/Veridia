# Vehicle Customization & Progression

Upgrade trees, crew mechanics, and living evolution paths. Ties into [[03_Mechanics/Complete Faction Warfare System]] doctrines, [[Memory Trading Economy System|Memory Trading Economy]] markets, and [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]].

## Modular Upgrade Systems
- Biological Grafting: Parasite symbionts, coral armor, regenerative sacs
- Crystal Harmonics: Resonance tuning, prism shields, focus lenses
- Pressure Mods: Adaptive ballast, crush frames, cavitation cloaks
- Memory Cores: Route libraries, echo recorders, identity locks
- Anchor Mounts: Personal/portable anchors, seal generators
- Deep Shrines: Sanity buffers, prophecy interfaces, curse risks

Mechanic: Each slot holds 1 module; installing adds Power draw and Maintenance burden. Over-capacity adds Stress per hour.

## Crew Management
- Roles grant mechanical actions (see [[Vehicle_Core_Rules#10) Crew Roles (Examples)|Crew Roles]])
- Sanity Pooling: Optional shared sanity for navigation
- Loyalty: Tied to faction standing; low loyalty causes disobedience events
- Memory-Linked Crew: Share skills at risk of identity bleed
- Adaptation Sync: Crew with similar AP reduce environmental DCs by 2

## Living Ship Evolution
- XP for Ships: Earned via journeys, battles, discoveries
- Evolution Paths: Bio Growth, Crystal Refinement, Memory Awakening, Anchor Sanctification
- Ship Traits: Gain boons but acquire hungers (e.g., hunger for memories, storms, hymns)
- Ship Madness: On XP thresholds with high Stress, roll on Ship Madness table (see [[Vessel_Horror_Intensifier|Vessel Horror Intensifier]])

## Example Upgrade Tree: Coral Leviathan
Tier 1: Coral Plating • Regenerative Pores • Reef Sensors
Tier 2: Choir Wells • Parasite Countermeasures • Symbiotic Brig
Tier 3: Cathedral Spine • Living Drydock • Oracle Polyps

Use [[05_Templates/Vehicles/New_Ship_Template|New Ship Template]] to attach upgrade notes per hull.

## Player-Facing Summary

Vehicle Customization Progression is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Vehicle Customization Progression as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Vehicle Customization Progression.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Vehicle Customization Progression to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at Vehicle Customization Progression to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to Vehicle Customization Progression active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
