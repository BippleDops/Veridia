## Mechanic Overview

**System**: D&D 5th Edition
**Type**: Rule Variant / Subsystem / Optional Rule
**Complexity**: Moderate
**Purpose**: Enhance gameplay in specific situations

## Description

Educational Systems and Institutions provides a structured approach to handling specific game situations that benefit from additional mechanical depth. This system integrates with existing D&D 5e rules while adding meaningful choices and consequences.

### Basic Resolution
The fundamental process works as follows:

1. **Trigger**: Specific situation arises requiring this mechanic
2. **Setup**: Establish parameters and stakes
3. **Action**: Players make choices using the system
4. **Resolution**: Determine outcomes based on rolls and decisions
5. **Consequences**: Apply results to ongoing game

### Prerequisites
Before using this mechanic:
- Specific conditions must be met
- Players must have certain capabilities
- DM establishes parameters

#### Step 1: Initiation
Determine when and how the mechanic activates:
- Player-triggered vs. DM-triggered
- Required declarations or preparations
- Cost or risk assessment

#### Step 2: Execution
The actual mechanical process:
1. Declare intended outcome
2. Commit resources (if applicable)
3. Make necessary rolls
4. Apply modifiers and advantages
5. Compare to target numbers

#### Step 3: Results
Determining success and degree:
- **Critical Success** (20 or beat DC by 10+): Exceptional outcome
- **Success** (Meet or beat DC): Intended result achieved
- **Partial Success** (Fail by 5 or less): Limited success with complication
- **Failure** (Fail by 6+): Intended result not achieved
- **Critical Failure** (1 or fail by 10+): Significant negative consequence

### Example 1: Basic Use
*Scenario*: [Specific situation]
- Player declares intent
- DM sets DC 15
- Player rolls d20+5, gets 17
- Success achieved with described outcome

### Example 2: Complex Application
*Scenario*: [More complex situation]
- Multiple participants involved
- Extended challenge requiring multiple rolls
- Resource management element
- Partial successes building to completion

### Example 3: Failed Attempt
*Scenario*: [Failure situation]
- What went wrong
- Consequences of failure
- Recovery options
- Learning from failure

### With Combat
How this mechanic works during combat:
- Action/bonus action/reaction cost
- Interaction with initiative
- Effects on combat dynamics

### With Exploration
Application during exploration:
- Time requirements
- Resource consumption
- Discovery opportunities
- Environmental interactions

### With Social Encounters
Using in social situations:
- Influence on negotiations
- Reputation effects
- Information gathering
- Relationship building

### Simplified Version
For quicker resolution:
- Single roll instead of multiple
- Fixed DCs instead of scaling
- Binary success/failure

### Advanced Version
For more detail:
- Additional roll types
- Multiple resource tracks
- Expanded outcome table
- Long-term consequences

### Alternative Approaches
Different ways to handle:
- Skill challenge format
- Narrative-focused resolution
- Point-buy system
- Card or dice pool mechanic

### Setting-Specific
Adapt for different settings:
- Fantasy adjustments
- Modern applications
- Science fiction variants
- Horror modifications

### Table Preferences
Adjust for group style:
- More/less rolling
- Narrative focus
- Tactical emphasis
- Player comfort level

### Problem 1: Overuse
Solution: Implement cooldowns or costs

### Problem 2: Complexity
Solution: Use simplified version initially

### Problem 3: Balance
Solution: Adjust DCs and modifiers

## Designer Notes

This mechanic aims to:
- Add depth without overwhelming complexity
- Provide meaningful choices
- Create memorable moments
- Enhance rather than replace core rules

## Quick Reference

**When to Use**: [Specific triggers]
**Basic Roll**: d20 + modifier vs. DC
**Success**: Achieve intended outcome
**Failure**: Complication or seck
**Resources**: [If applicable]
**Recovery**: [How resources return]
