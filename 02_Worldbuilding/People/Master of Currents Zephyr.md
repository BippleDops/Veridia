# Master of Currents Zephyr
*The Tide's Commander, He Who Rides the Deep Flows, Lord of Liquid Roads*

## Overview
Master of Currents Zephyr is the supreme authority over water movement and underwater trade routes in [[Aquabyssos]]. Neither fully elemental nor entirely humanoid, Zephyr exists as a conscious manifestation of the ocean's currents themselves, given form and purpose during the Great Drowning.
