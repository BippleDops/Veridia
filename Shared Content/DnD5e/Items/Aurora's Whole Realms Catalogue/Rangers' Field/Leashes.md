## Description
Though a trained bear might make a fine companion in the wilds, it would doubtless cause a panic if brought unleashed into a city. We therefore offer chain leash and collar assemblies in various sizes: common cat (2 sp); small dog (4 sp); common dog (5 sp); wolf (6 gp), dire wolf (8 sp). These sets are not meant for use on sapient creatures.
