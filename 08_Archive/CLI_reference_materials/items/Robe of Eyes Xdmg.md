# Robe of Eyes
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/robe-of-eyes.webp#right)


This robe is adorned with eyelike patterns. While you wear the robe, you gain the following benefits:

- **All-Around Vision.** The robe gives you [Advantage](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on Wisdom ([Perception](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Perception)) checks that rely on sight.  
- **Special Senses.** You have [Darkvision](/03_Mechanics/CLI/senses.md#Darkvision) and [Truesight](/03_Mechanics/CLI/senses.md#Truesight), both with a range of 120 feet.  

## Drawbacks

A [Light](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/light-xphb.md) spell cast on the robe or a [Daylight](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/daylight-xphb.md) spell cast within 5 feet of the robe gives you the [Blinded](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Blinded) condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for Light or DC 15 for Daylight), ending the condition on yourself on a success.
