# Unicorn

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing a unicorn's lair is changed by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Obscuring Foliage.** The unicorn and its allies have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on Dexterity ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Stealth|Stealth]]) checks while within 1 mile of the lair.  
- **Positive Energy.** Whenever a creature within 1 mile of the lair regains [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] from a spell, it regains the maximum number of [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] possible. Additionally, the effects of curses are suppressed within 1 mile of the lair.  

If the unicorn dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.
