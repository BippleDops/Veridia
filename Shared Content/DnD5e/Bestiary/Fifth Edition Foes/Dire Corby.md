## Description
deep beneath the surface world. They make their homes in large, open caverns where they hollow out individual shelters in the walls. These creatures do not now have wings, but they almost certainly did in the remote past. Why their wings disappeared and were replaced by muscular arms with claws is unknown.

Dire corbies are omnivores but prefer a diet of fresh meat. They hunt and enjoy the flesh of subterranean rodents, animals, and even other races. They are particularly fond of the leathery flesh of bats.

Dire corbies hunt in flocks. They enjoy the thrill of the hunt and chasing down their prey. A typical hunt ends with the prey cornered and trapped, then cruelly tormented and tortured for many minutes before the dire corbies finally tear it to shreds with their claws.

Dire corbies always fight to the death and never flee, even when faced with overwhelming odds.
