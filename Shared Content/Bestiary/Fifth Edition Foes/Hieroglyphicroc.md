## Special Traits
**Swallow:** A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained. It takes 7 (`dice: 1d8+3`) bludgeoning damage automatically at the start of each of the hieroglyphicroc's turns. Only one Medium creature or two Small creatures can be inside the hieroglyphicroc at one time. A swallowed creature is unaffected by anything happening outside the hieroglyphicroc or by attacks from outside it. A swallowed creature can get out of the hieroglyphicroc by using 5 feet of movement, but only after the hieroglyphicroc is destroyed. A humanoid that dies inside a hieroglyphicroc reanimates as a zombie `dice: 1d4` rounds later, and is regurgitated by the hieroglyphicroc.

**Unholy Fortitude:** Hieroglyphicrocs are highly resistant to turning. They have tactical advantage on saving throws against being turned.

## Actions
**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (`dice: 2d10+3`) piercing damage. If the attack causes 16 or more damage to a Medium or smaller creature, the target must make a successful DC 13 Strength saving throw or be swallowed by the hieroglyphicroc (see above).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Arid tombs

**Organization**: Solitary or troop (2–7)

## Description
Raised by ancient methods long forgotten or suppressed, hieroglyphicrocs resemble zombie crocodiles. They are actually more akin to mummies than to zombies, largely because they are created by a similar process. A hieroglyphicroc’s eyes glow with a yellow light, and they have rudimentary intelligence. Often they are created to serve as defenders of tombs where mummies are also found.

Because of their animal origin, these creatures are resistant to clerical turning. A tomb defended by hieroglyphicrocs is also likely to contain at least a few wandering zombies—the remains of unfortunate tomb robbers who ran afoul of the hieroglyphicroc guardians.

The skin of these undead creatures is often painted with hieroglyphs describing the terrible fates that await those who plunder the tomb and meant to give the hieroglyphicrocs endurance and resolve in their duties.
