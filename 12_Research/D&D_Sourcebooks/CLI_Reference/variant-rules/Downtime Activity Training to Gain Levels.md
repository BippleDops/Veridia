# Downtime Activity: Training to Gain Levels
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 131* 

As a variant rule, you can require characters to spend downtime training or studying before they gain the benefits of a new level. If you choose this option, once a character has earned enough experience points to attain a new level, he or she must train for a number of days before gaining any class features associated with the new level.

The training time required depends on the level to be gained, as shown on the Training to Gain Levels table. The training cost is for the total training time.

**Training to Gain Levels**

| Level Attained | Training Time | Training Cost |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| 2nd-4th | 10 days | 20 gp |
| 5th-10th | 20 days | 40 gp |
| 11th-16th | 30 days | 60 gp |
| 17th-20th | 40 days | 80 gp |
