--- > [!figure] View # The Original Palace *The ancestral seat of the [[Deep Ones and the architectural marvel that served as the model for all subsequent underwater royal residences, the Original Palace stands as a testament to the ancient mastery of aquatic civilization.* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview Deep within the [Midnight Trenches]] of [[Aquabyssos, at a crushing depth where sunlight has never touched stone, rises the Original Palace—the first and greatest of all underwater royal residences. Built over three millennia ago by the [Elder Deep Ones]] using techniques lost to time, this magnificent structure served as the template for the later [[The Coral Throne|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Coral Throne chambers and remains the ceremonial heart of the [Abyssal Courts]]. The palace exists in a state of constant, gentle motion, its living coral walls breathing with the rhythm of the deep currents. Bioluminescent organisms integrated into the architecture provide an ethereal glow that shifts through the spectrum of deep-sea colors: blues, purples, and the occasional flash of silver or gold. ### The Living Foundation

Unlike surface palaces built from dead stone, the Original Palace grows from a massive [[Titan Coral formation that has been carefully cultivated for millennia. The coral continues to grow and adapt, incorporating new chambers and passages as needed. The foundation extends deep into the sea floor, its roots intertwining with underwater volcanic vents that provide both heat and mineral nutrients. **Key Architectural Features:**
- **Self-repairing walls:** Damaged sections regenerate over time
- **Climate control:** Natural temperature regulation through coral metabolism
- **Defensive capabilities:** Passages can seal themselves against intruders

- **Architecture:** Crystalline formations that amplify magical energies ### The Connecting Bridges

Between the spires, graceful bridges of woven [[Sea Silk and reinforced coral create pathways that undulate with the current. These bridges can be retracted in times of danger, isolating each spire for defense. ### The Royal Court

**Summary**: The Royal Court - Key information at a glance.

Though the throne stands empty following the events of [The Depth Accords]], the palace remains home to a significant population: **[[Regent Thalassa** (Ancient Deep One Noble)

**Level Range:** 5-8 **Type:** Investigation & Exploration Rumors suggest that the rightful heir to the throne—thought lost centuries ago—may still be alive, hidden somewhere within the palace's deepest chambers. Characters are hired to investigate these claims and either confirm or debunk them. The investigation leads through forgotten passages, ancient family crypts, and chambers that haven't been opened in hundreds of years. **Potential Discoveries:**
- Secret bloodline preserved in magical stasis
- False heir planted by political rivals
- The "heir" is actually an awakened construct created by ancient magic
- Multiple legitimate claimants with competing claims ### The Coral Plague

**Level Range:** 6-10 **Type:** Mystery & Dungeon Crawl The living coral that forms the palace's foundation has begun showing signs of a mysterious blight that threatens to destroy the entire structure. Characters must dive deeper than any have gone before, into the palace's root systems, to discover the source of the corruption and find a cure before the architectural marvel collapses. **Investigation Elements:**
- Analysis of affected coral samples
- Interviews with the [[Reef Tenders
- Exploration of the deep foundation chambers
- Encounters with creatures that may be causing or affected by the blight ### The Diplomatic Crisis

**Level Range:** 7-11 **Type:** Social Encounters & Intrigue Representatives from multiple surface kingdoms arrive simultaneously at the palace, each claiming to have the authority to negotiate new treaties with the [Abyssal Courts]]. Characters must navigate the complex web of underwater politics while uncovering which delegation, if any, is legitimate—and which may be working to sabotage the negotiations. **Social Challenges:**
- Formal court protocols and etiquette
- Identifying imposters and spies
- Managing competing interests and demands
- Preventing diplomatic incidents that could lead to war ### The Ancient Awakening

**Level Range:** 9-14 **Type:** Epic Adventure Something stirs in the deepest chambers of the palace—chambers that sealeded since its construction. Ancient guardians that were thought to be decorative have begun to move, and voices speaking in the [[Old Tongue echo through the halls. Characters must uncover what ancient power is awakening and whether it represents salvation or doom for the palace and its inhabitants. **Epic Elements:**
- Encounters with primordial creatures
- Ancient magical traps and puzzles
- Revelation of the palace's true purpose
- Potential connection to other planes or realities ### The Treasure Hunt

**Level Range:** 4-7 **Type:** Exploration & Problem-Solving A coded map discovereded that allegedly leads to a hidden treasure vault within the palace—one that even [Regent Thalassa]] doesn't know about. Characters must decipher the ancient clues while avoiding the palace's security systems and discovering whether the treasure is worth the risks involved. **Puzzle Elements:**
- Ancient codes and cipher systems
- Hidden passages and secret doors
- Traps designed to test worthiness
- Multiple possible treasure locations ### The [[The Coral Throne|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Coral Throne Chamber

The destroyed throne that sparked [The Depth Accords]] quest was a newer creation, modeled after the Original Palace's design. Pieces of the original throne remain here, and they may hold the key to creating a permanent replacement. ### The [[Abyssal Courts

The three courts that figure prominently in major diplomatic quests maintain permanent embassies within the palace. These embassy chambers serve as neutral ground for inter-court negotiations. ### The [Midnight Trenches]]

The palace sits at the heart of this vast underwater canyon system, which contains numerous other points of interest, ruins, and dangerous creatures that can serve as additional adventure sites. ### Surface Connections

Though deep beneath the waves, the palace maintains secret connections to surface locations through:
- Hidden underwater caves that connect to coastal cities
- Magical portals that allow rapid transit
- Networks of loyal surface agents and diplomats
- Trade routes for rare materials needed for palace maintece ### The True Purpose

While most believe the Original Palace was built purely as a royal residence, ancient texts suggest it serves a more fundamental purpose: it's a massive magical focus that helps maintain the barrier between the material plane and the [[Far Realms. The increasing instability following recent political upheavals may weaken this barrier. ### The Missing Rooms

Palace maps from different eras show chambers that no longer exist or can't be found. Some scholars believe these rooms exist in a state of temporal flux, occasionally appearing and disappearing. Characters who find these chambers may encounter inhabitants from the past or future. ### The Listening Walls

The coral walls of the palace have been absorbing conversations for thousands of years. Master [Reef Tenders]] know how to coax memories from the coral, potentially revealing ancient secrets, forgotten plots, or valuable information about long-dead rulers. ### The Deep Foundations

The palace's roots extend far deeper than most realize, connecting to an underground network of caverns that may predate the [[Deep Ones themselves. These caverns contain evidence of even more ancient civilizations and powers that once ruled the depths. ### Practical Considerations

- Water breathing and pressure protection are essential
- Normal surface food spoils quickly; local cuisine requires acquired taste
- Communication with palace inhabitants may require translation magic
- The palace's day/night cycle follows deep-sea patterns, not surface rhythms The Original Palace stands not just as an architectural wonder, but as a living piece of history that continues to shape the political and magical landscape of [Aquabyssos]]. Its ancient halls have witnessed the rise and fall of dynasties, the forging of treaties that shaped continents, and the preservation of secrets that could change the fate of multiple worlds. ## Player-Facing Summary The Original Palace is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Original Palace as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Original Palace. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Cross-References - [[The Original Palace|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Original Palace riched: true -->
