# Sanctuary
*Level 5 Bastion facility*  

- **Prerequisites**: Ability to use a [[holy-symbol-xphb|Holy Symbol]] or [[druidic-focus-xphb|Druidic Focus]] as a [[spellcasting-focus-xphb|Spellcasting Focus]]
- **Space**: Roomy (16 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 1
- **Order**: craft

Icons of your religion are displayed in this facility, which includes a quiet place for worship.

## Sanctuary Charm

After spending a Long Rest in your Bastion, you gain a magical [[sanctuary-charm-xdmg|Charm]] (see ""Supernatural Gifts"" in "chapter 3") that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast [[healing-word-xphb|Healing Word]] once without expending a spell slot. You can't gain this Charm again while you still have it.

## Craft: Sacred Focus

When you issue the "Craft" order to this facility, you commission the facility's hireling to craft a [[druidic-focus-xphb|Druidic Focus]] ([[wooden-staff-xphb|wooden staff]]) or a [[holy-symbol-xphb|Holy Symbol]]. The work takes 7 days and costs no money. The item remains in your Bastion until you claim it.

## Player-Facing Summary

Sanctuary is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of sanctuary as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around sanctuary.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties sanctuary to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at sanctuary to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to sanctuary active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
