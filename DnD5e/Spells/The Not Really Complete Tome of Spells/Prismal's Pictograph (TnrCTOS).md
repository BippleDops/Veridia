# Prismal's Pictograph (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (an empty ink well, a feather pen, and a surface on which to write)

**Duration**: Until dispelled


## Effects
You turn one creature or object in range that you can see into a full-color, two-dimensional image on the surface you have provided. The creature or object is reduced to 12:1 scale; it must be able to fit on the writing surface in its reduced form for the spell to work. An unwilling creature may make a Charisma saving throw to avoid the effect.

You decide whether the creature is to re-main animate (in which case, it counts as restrained, although it still can move slowly about its canvas in a stilted manner), or if it to become a still picture. If you choose to allow it to remain animate, it can see and hear, but cannot speak, attack, or cast spells. If you choose for the creature to become a still pic-ture, the creature is put in stasis. In both cases, the creature does not age, eat, drink, sleep, or breathe. Inanimate objects remain in the picture indefinitely.

A trapped creature may make a new saving throw each day. On a success, this effect ends and the creature is freed. A *dispel magic, remove curse,* or *wish* spell can also end this effect.
