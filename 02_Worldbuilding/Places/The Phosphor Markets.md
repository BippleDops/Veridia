# The Phosphor Markets - The Glowing Bazaar

## Overview
The Phosphor Markets are a massive floating collection of bioluminescent platforms, ships, and structures that drift through the Gloom Gardens, never staying in one location for more than a week. This mobile marketplace is the economic heart of [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Aquabyssos World Overview|Aquabyssos]], where all factions trade despite political tensions. The market's neutrality is enforced by the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/Merchant's Covenant|Merchant's Covenant]], a powerful trading guild that predates the drowning.

## DM Guidance & Tips

### Running Market Encounters
**Atmosphere Creation**:
- Emphasize the constant motion and pressure changes
- Use sensory details: bioluminescent lighting, pressure in ears, water currents
- Create a sense of organized chaos with multiple activities happening simultaneously
- Highlight the diversity of creatures and cultures interacting peacefully

### Social Encounters
**Negotiation Guidelines**:
- All major trades require at least three parties: buyer, seller, and witness
- Cultural differences affect trading styles (direct vs. ritualistic)
- Reputation matters more than immediate payment in many cases
- Information is often as valuable as physical goods

### Combat Considerations
**Environmental Factors**:
- Three-dimensional movement through water affects positioning
- Pressure weapons are more dangerous in confined spaces
- Bioluminescent creatures can be blinded by bright light sources
- Sound travels differently underwater, affecting communication spells

### Economic Integration
**Campaign Economy**:
- Use the markets to introduce rare items and plot-relevant materials
- Fluctuating prices can drive adventure motivation
- Market connections provide information network for players
- Economic warfare can create non-violent conflict scenarios

### Scaling for Different Levels
**Low Level (1-5)**: Focus on simple trading, minor disputes, and cultural learning
**Mid Level (6-10)**: Involve complex negotiations, market manipulation, and factional politics
**High Level (11-15)**: Deal with market-wide crises, international trade wars, and economic espionage
