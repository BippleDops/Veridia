# Transmute Rock (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
This are new variants of the spell *transmute rock* that appears in the *Elemental Evil Player’s Companion,* pg.22.

♦ ***Flowstone.*** You cause normal rock to flow like thick syrup, allowing it to move around objects, be directed into a mold and then allowed to harden, etc. This version of the spell has a duration of 1 minute.

♦ ***Transmute Sand to Stone.*** Nonmagical sand in the area no more than 10 feet deep transforms into sandstone for the spell’s duration. This is otherwise identical to the *transmute mud to rock* version of this spell.

♦ ***Transmute Snow to Stone.*** Nonmagical snow or ice in the area no more than 10 feet deep can be transformed into a soft, porous white rock such as soapstone or talc, or into chalk. This is otherwise identical to the *transmute mud to rock* version of this spell.

♦ ***Transmute Stone to Sand.*** Nonmagical rock of any type, including gemstones, is transformed into an equal vol-ume of sand. This is otherwise identical to the *transmute rock to mud* version of this spell.

♦ ***Transmute Stone to Snow.*** Non-magical stone of any type is transformed into an equal volume snow. This is otherwise identical to the *transmute rock to mud* version of this spell.
