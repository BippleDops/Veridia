## Overview
The Tenebrarum Ambassadors represent a mysterious shadow realm that exists parallel to both Aquabyssos and the surface world. These diplomatic figures serve as intermediaries between their shadowy domain and the underwater kingdom, negotiating treaties, trade agreements, and mutual defense pacts. Their embassy, located in the darkest districts of [[Abyssos Prime|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Abyssos Prime]], operates under ancient diplomatic immunities while pursuing their realm's complex political agenda.

The Tenebrarum realm itself is described as a place where shadows have substance and light creates darkness, where the normal rules of reality bend to accommodate beings of living shadow. The Ambassadors claim their realm has existed alongside the material world since ancient times, but only recently began formal diplomatic contact with Aquabyssos following the Great Drowning.

2. **The Diplomatic Incident**: Embassy staff accused of espionage, requiring investigation

## Speaking Style & Diplomatic Protocol
*"The shadows between our realms grow thin, honored representatives of the depths. Let us weave new understanding from the darkness and light we both cherish."* - Formal diplomatic greeting

*"In Tenebrarum, we say that the deepest shadows are cast by the brightest lights. Perhaps our peoples can illumine each other's paths."* - Cultural exchange commentary

*"Diplomacy, like shadow-weaving, requires patience, precision, and respect for the materials with which one works."* - On negotiation philosophy

*"Our realm offers sanctuary to those who find no place in the light. Aquabyssos, having created new life from drowning, understands transformation."* - On refugee assistance

*(Shadow-speech allows for communication in multiple languages simultaneously, creating an effect of speaking directly to each listener in their native tongue)*
