The Liminal Trading Company has built a vast commercial empire based on the simple principle that different worlds have different resources, and where there are differences, there is profit. Operating from [[pat|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/pat]]â€”a dimensional nexus that exists partially in both [[Aethermoor|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]â€”they facilitate trade between the realms while maintaining careful political neutrality. Their success comes from being indispensable to both worlds while belonging fully to neither. ## Adventure Hooks

1. **The Trade War**: Mediate dispute between Company and local merchants
2. **The Smuggling Ring**: Investigate illegal goods moving through Company channels
3. **The Diplomatic Incident**: Help resolve cross-realm political crisis affecting trade
4. **The Floating Market Heist**: Protect or plan robbery of dimensional trading post
5. **The Portal Pirates**: Stop raiders attacking Company transport routes ### Company Hierarchy


1. **Portal Apprentice**: New employees learning basic dimensional travel
2. **Trade Courier**: Qualified to transport simple goods between realms
3. **Cultural Liaison**: Specialist in one realm's customs and markets
4. **Dimensional Navigator**: Licensed to pilot through unstable portal routes
5. **Market Specialist**: Expert in specific commodity types or regions
6. **Trade Captain**: Authorized to negotiate major deals independently
7. **Regional Director**: Manages Company operations in specific areas
8. **Executive Council Member**: Leadership positions with Company-wide authority ### The Profit Paradigm


The Company operates under the fundamental principle that economic prosperity creates peace and stability. Their corporate culture emphasizes:
- **Cross-Cultural Competency**: All employees must understand both realm cultures
- **Neutral Professionalism**: Personal politics never interfere with business
- **Innovation Incentives**: Bonuses for discovering new trade opportunities
- **Risk Management**: Comprehensive insurance and safety protocols
- **Long-term Thinking**: Decisions evaluated for multi-decade impact ### The Profit Above All Doctrine

Despite public claims of ethical business practices, internal memos reveal the Company sometimes trades in morally questionable goods and services when profits are substantial enough. ### Portal Monopoly Manipulation

The Company has secret agreements with government officials to limit competitor access to dimensional travel, maintaining their effective monopoly through regulatory capture. ### The Quantum Accountant's Identity

This mysterious figure is actually an artificial intelligence created from the merged consciousness of seven brilliant economists, explaining their supernatural ability to predict market trends. ### Realm Destabilization Profits

Some executives have discovered they can profit from creating minor conflicts and trade disruptions, then offering expensive solutions to problems they secretly caused. ### The Convergence Investment

The Company has secretly invested heavily in [[The Convergence Seekers|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/The Convergence Seekers]], believing merged worlds would create unprecedented business opportunities despite massive initial disruption. ### Long-Term Vision (25+ Years)

The Company ultimately envisions itself as the foundation of a unified multi-dimensional economy, with their neutral status and cross-realm expertise making them indispensable to any future political arrangements between worlds. ## Player-Facing Summary The Liminal Trading Company is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
