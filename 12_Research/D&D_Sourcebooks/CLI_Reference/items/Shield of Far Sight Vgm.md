*Armor ([[Shield]]), rare* - **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs. A [[Mind Flayer Xmm]] skilled at crafting magic items creates a shield of far sight by harvesting an eye from an intelligent humanoid and magically implanting it on the outer surface of a nonmagical shield. The shield becomes a magic item once the eyes is implanted, whereupon the [[Mind Flayer Xmm]] can give the shield to a thrall or hang it on a wall in its lair. As long as the shield is on the same plane of existence as its creator, the [[Mind Flayer Xmm]] can see through the shield's eye, which has [[senses#Darkvision|darkvision]] out to a range of 60 feet. While peering through this magical eye, the [[Mind Flayer Xmm]] can use its Mind Blast action as though it were standing behind the shield. If a shield of far sight is destroyed, the [[Mind Flayer Xmm]] that created it is [[conditions#Blinded|blinded]] for`2d12`hours. *Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 81* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Shield of far sight vgm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
