--- > [!figure] Portrait # Sanctum

*Level 17 Bastion facility* - **Prerequisites**: Ability to use a [[Symbol Xphb or [druidic-focus-xphb (items)]] as a [[spellcasting-focus-xphb (variant-rules)
- **Space**: Roomy (16 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 4
- **Order**: empower A Sanctum is a place of solace and healing. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Sanctum Charm After spending a Long Rest in your Bastion, you gain a magical [sanctum-charm-xdmg (rewards)]] (see ""Supernatural Gifts"" in "chapter 3") that lasts for 7 days or until you use it. The Charm allows you to cast [[heal-xphb (spells) once without expending a spell slot. You can't gain this Charm again while you still have it. ## Empower: Fortifying Rites When you issue the "Empower" order to this facility, you inspire its hirelings to perform daily rites that benefit you or another character you name. The beneficiary doesn't need to be in the Bastion when the rites are performed to gain their benefit. Each time the beneficiary finishes a Long Rest, they gain [temporary-hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] equal to your level. This effect lasts for 7 days. ## Sanctum Recall While the Sanctum exists, you always have the [[word-of-recall-xphb (spells) spell prepared. When you cast [word-of-recall-xphb (spells)]], you can make your Sanctum the destination of the spell instead of another place you have previously designated. In addition, one creature of your choice that arrives in the Sanctum via this spell gains the benefit of a [[heal-xphb (spells) spell. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 346* ## Player-Facing Summary Sanctum is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of sanctum as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around sanctum. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A map reveals the truth about the cult
