## Overview

The Void Tears represent one of the most terrifying and unpredictable phenomena in [Aethermoor]], appearing as spontaneous rifts in reality that create direct portals to the primordial void - the space between dimensions where existence itself ceases to have meaning. These reality breaches manifest primarily within [[The Crystalline Wastes, though smaller tears have been documented throughout regions of high magical instability.

Unlike mere dimensional portals or planar rifts, Void Tears connect to absolute nothingness - not another plane or reality, but the fundamental absence of existence that underlies the [Multiverse]]. Matter, energy, magic, consciousness, and even concepts that approach these rifts are systematically unraveled and consumed, returning to the state of primordial void from which all things originally emerged.

The tears appear without warning, ranging from hairline fractures in reality barely visible to the naked eye, to massive chasms hundreds of feet across that devour entire landscapes. Each manifestation threatens not just individual lives, but the structural integrity of reality itself within the affected region.

### Origin Theory

The leading theory among dimensional scholars suggests that Void Tears result from the extreme [[Reality Distortion created by [The Great Crystallization]]. When the catastrophic magical event rewrote the fundamental laws of physics across the Crystalline Wastes, it created "weak spots" in the fabric of reality itself.

**The Cascade Effect**: Initial [[Crystal Corruption destabilized local reality, creating microscopic void fractures that occasionally expand into full tears when exposed to additional magical stress or dimensional manipulation.

**The Resoce Factor**: Crystal formations throughout the Wastes some[Time]]s achieve resoce frequencies that literally vibrate reality apart at the quantum level, opening [[pathways to the void between dimensions.

**The Consciousness Drain**: Some researchers believe that the collective trauma and despair generated by the Great Crystallization created "psychic vacuum zones" where the will to exist itself was so thoroughly destroyed that reality simply[Quest Corruption in ... Connected To: Regional Politics and Trade Related Locations: Nearby Settlements|...]] stopped.

#### Manifestation Patterns

**Sudden Onset**: Most tears appear instantaneously without warning signs
**Gradual Expansion**: Some begin as tiny fractures and slowly grow over time
**Pulsing Behavior**: Active tears may rhythmically expand and contract
**Migration**: Smaller tears occasionally "drift" across the landscape
**Resoce Formation**: Multiple small tears sometimes merge into larger ones

#### Wandering Tears

Mobile void rifts that drift across landscapes, leaving trails of consumption in their wake. These tears seem to follow ley lines or areas of high magical concentration, suggesting some form of supernatural attraction to energy sources.

#### Resoce Clusters

[[Groups of smaller tears that appear simultaneously in geometric patterns, often forming triangles, hexagons, or more complex magical geometric shapes. The spaces between clustered tears become increasingly unstable.

#### Dormant Fractures

Sealed or inactive tears that appear as faint dark lines or scars in reality. While temporarily harmless, these can reopen under magical stress or dimensional pressure.

### Immediate Consumption Zone

**Distance**: 0-10 feet from tear edge
**Effect**: Complete annihilation of matter and energy
**Process**: Objects don't burn, dissolve, or transform - they simply cease to exist
**Duration**: Instantaneous consumption upon contact
**Recovery**: Nothing that enters this zone can be retrieved

### Reality Distortion Field

**Distance**: 10-50 feet from tear edge (varies by tear size)
**Effects**:
- **Physical Laws Breakdown**: Gravity, thermodynamics, and electromagnetic forces become unreliable
- **Magical Interference**: Spells fail unpredictably, magical items malfunction
- **Temporal Anomalies**: Time flows irregularly, causing aging or youth effects
- **Spatial Warping**: Distances become meaningless, straight paths curve impossibly
- **Sensory Confusion**: Sight, sound, and other senses provide contradictory information

### Probability Chaos Zone

**Distance**: 50-200 feet from tear edge
**Effects**:
- **Impossible Events**: Statistically impossible outcomes become commonplace
- **Luck Fluctuations**: Extreme good and bad fortune alternates randomly
- **Causal Breakdown**: Effects occasionally precede their causes
- **Reality Echoes**: Past events sometimes repeat or overlay present circumstances
- **Existential Doubt**: Individuals begin questioning the nature of their own existence

#### Detection

**Passive Perception **DC 15****: Notice reality distortions (warped light, impossible shadows)
**Arcana **DC 20****: Identify the phenomenon as dimensional instability
**Investigation **DC 25****: Determine approximate size and danger level of hidden tears
**Survival **DC 18****: Track the movement patterns of wandering tears

#### Saving Throws

**Constitution Save**: Required when entering reality distortion fields
- ****DC 15****: Probability chaos zone effects
- ****DC 18****: Reality distortion field effects
- ****DC 22****: Resisting immediate consumption at tear edge

**Wisdom Save**: Required to maintain sanity when observing void tears
- ****DC 16****: Avoid temporary madness from existential terror
- ****DC 20****: Prevent long-term psychological trauma
- ****DC 25****: Resist compulsion to approach and enter tears

#### Immediate Consumption

Any creature or object making contact with a Void Tear is immediately and permanently destroyed without any saving throw. This includes:
- Physical matter of any kind
- Magical energy and spells
- Soul essence and consciousness
- Memories of the consumed entity from other beings
- Written records that mention the consumed entity

#### [Reality Distortion Effects]]

**Spell Failure**: All spells cast within distortion field have 25% chance of complete failure
**Magic Item Malfunction**: 10% chance per round that magical items cease functioning
**Temporal Aging**: Constitution save or age `dice: 1d4` years per minute of exposure
**Spatial Displacement**: Movement becomes unreliable, may end up in unexpected locations

#### [[Environmental Hazards

**Void Pull** (Type II+ tears): Strength save **DC 18** or be pulled 10 feet closer to tear
**Reality Storm**: [Magic Missile]]-like effect from dimensional instability (`dice: 3d4`+3 force damage)
**[[Temporal Echo**: Previous round's actions repeat automatically
**Probability Spike**: Roll on wild magic surge table each round

#### Tear-Spawned Entities

Some void tears occasionally spawn entities from the space between realities:

** Shades**: Humanoid-shaped absences that drain life force and memories
- AC 16, HP 45, Speed 30 ft (hover)
- Immune to physical damage, vulnerable to radiant damage
- Life Drain attack: Constitution save or lose `dice: 1d4` Constitution permanently

**Reality Wraiths**: Echoes of beings consumed by tears
- Retain appearance and memories of original person
- Desperately attempt to drag others into void to end their non-existence
- Phase in and out of reality unpredictably

**Void Stalkers**: Predatory entities that hunt along tear edges
- Invisible except when consuming prey
- Can phase through matter at will
- Instinctively drawn to magical energy and strong emotions
