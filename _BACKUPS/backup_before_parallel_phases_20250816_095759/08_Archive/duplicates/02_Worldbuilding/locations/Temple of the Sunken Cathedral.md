## Overview

The Temple of the Sunken Cathedral serves as the primary worship site for the [[Deep Mother cult in Aquabyssos. Once the Grand Cathedral of [Tidal Harmony]], this massive religious structure was pulled into the ocean depths during the first major manifestation event 47 years ago. Rather than being destroyed, the cathedral transformed into something architecturally impossible - a building that exists in multiple dimensions simultaneously, where geometric laws serve cosmic rather than physical principles.

### The Inverted Spires

The cathedral's seven spires extend both upward toward the surface and downward into the ocean floor simultaneously. These twin spires exist as single structures that somehow occupy space in opposite directions. Visitors swimming "up" along one spire will find themselves descending along its mirror image, while those descending find themselves ascending. The spires serve as dimensional anchors, allowing the cathedral to exist in the space between realities.

**Navigation Effect**: Characters attempting to use the spires for orientation must make **DC 18** Wisdom saves or become directionally confused, losing track of which way is up or down.

### The Sanctuary of Flowing Space

The main sanctuary measures precisely 200 feet long, 100 feet wide, and 50 feet high when viewed from outside. However, the interior contains over 3,000 square feet of floor space arranged in patterns that should be geometrically impossible. Pews are arranged in concentric circles around a central altar, yet each pew also faces toward the altar no matter which direction observers approach from.

**Seating Capacity**: The sanctuary seats exactly 343 congregants (7Ã—7Ã—7), though the pews appear to accommodate only 200 individuals when empty.

### The Confession Chambers

Seven confession chambers line the sanctuary's perimeter, each one larger inside than outside. The chambers connect to each other through doorways that lead in directions that don't exist - north-below, east-within, up-around. Penitents entering one chamber may exit from any other chamber, or from the same chamber at a different [[Time.

**Temporal Effect**: Conversations in confession chambers can be overheard by previous or future penitents. Secrets told here echo across time.

### The Baptismal Pool

Located at the cathedral's heart, this pool contains water from seven different oceans across multiple realities. The water appears to flow upward from the pool's bottom while simultaneously flowing downward from above. Depending on viewing angle, the pool appears to be a fountain, a whirlpool, a perfectly still surface, or an empty basin.

**Baptismal Effect**: Full immersion in the pool grants one transformation stage toward Deep Mother servitude but also provides communion with her consciousness.

### The Bell Tower Paradox

The bell tower exists at the cathedral's highest point and lowest point simultaneously. The seven bells ring in harmonies that travel downward through water and upward through air at the same time. When all seven bells toll together, they create resoces that can be heard in dreams across both realms.

**Auditory Range**: The bells can be heard by anyone sleeping within 100 miles, manifesting as Deep Mother's voice in their dreams.

### The High Altar of Depths

**Physical Description**: A massive [Coral]] formation that grows both upward from the floor and downward from the ceiling, meeting in the middle in defiance of gravity. The coral lives and breathes, its polyps opening and closing in rhythm with unknown tides. The altar surface shifts between coral, stone, flesh, and void depending on the observer's mental state.

**Function**: Serves as focal point for major rituals and sacrificial ceremonies. The altar can process offerings of memory, sanity, and identity as easily as physical matter.

**Special Properties**: 
- Spells cast from the altar gain +2 DC when targeting creatures not loyal to Deep Mother
- The altar responds to emotional rather than physical touch
- Sacrifices placed on the altar transform based on Deep Mother's current needs

### The Gallery of [[Drowned Saints

**Layout**: A circular chamber surrounding the main sanctuary, containing 49 alcoves (7Ã—7). Each alcove houses a statue of an individual who achieved "perfect unity" with Deep Mother. The statues are carved from water itself, maintaining liquid form while holding solid shape.

**The Saints**: Former clergy, scholars, and cult leaders who volunteered for complete transformation. Each statue weeps constantly, their tears joining the baptismal pool's water supply.

**Interactive Elements**: Touching a statue allows communication with the saint's consciousness, providing advice, prophecy, or [Forbidden Knowledge]] at the cost of `dice: 1d4` sanity per conversation.

### The Scriptorium of Fluid Texts

**Description**: A library chamber where books write themselves in real-time. The texts are composed of flowing water shaped into readable words that continuously change as Deep Mother's knowledge expands. Reading requires maintaining focus while the words literally flow across the page.

**Collection**: Contains prophecies, rituals, philosophical treatises, and practical instructions for cult operations. New books spontaneously generate when specific knowledge becomes needed.

**Reading Hazard**: Each book requires **DC 15** Intelligence save to read effectively. Failure results in information overflow (`dice: 1d6` sanity loss). Success grants advantage on one Knowledge-based roll within 24 hours.

### The Chamber of Echoing Depths

**Acoustic Properties**: This spherical chamber amplifies whispers into thunderous proclamations while reducing screams to gentle murmurs. The acoustic properties depend on the speaker's relationship to Deep Mother - cultists' words carry perfectly while opponents' voices are muffled.

**Ritual Use**: Primary location for group chanting and harmonic ceremonies. When 49 cultists chant in unison here, their voices can influence weather patterns across both realms.

**The Deep Resoce**: Once per day, a cultist of sufficient rank can use the chamber to speak directly with Deep Mother, receiving answers to three questions at the cost of `dice: 1d6` sanity per question.

### The Transformation Pools

**Layout**: Seven pools of varying sizes arranged around a central platform. Each pool contains different alchemical solutions designed to facilitate specific aspects of Deep Mother transformation.

**Pool Functions**:
1. **Pressure Adaptation Pool**: Grants ability to survive at any depth
2. **Parasitic Symbiosis Pool**: Introduces beneficial parasites 
3. **Sensory Enhancement Pool**: Develops Deep Mother perception abilities
4. **Memory Integration Pool**: Allows access to collective cult knowledge
5. **[[Temporal Displacement Pool**: Provides limited time travel abilities
6. **Reality Perception Pool**: Enables sight beyond normal dimensions
7. **Unity Preparation Pool**: Final stage before ego dissolution

**Transformation Risk**: Each pool requires increasingly difficult Constitution saves (**DC 12**-25). Failure results in partial transformation that may be helpful or harmful depending on circumstances.

### The Meditation Grottos

**Structure**: Forty-nine small chambers carved into the cathedral's living walls. Each grotto is sized for one person and provides perfect acoustic isolation from the outside world while maintaining connection to Deep Mother's consciousness.

**Meditation Effects**: Extended meditation (4+ hours) allows direct communication with Deep Mother but requires Wisdom saves (**DC 18**) to avoid losing one's sense of individual identity.

**The Deep Trance**: Cultists who meditate here for 24 continuous hours may receive [Prophetic Visions]] but risk never waking up, their consciousness joining the collective permanently.

#### The Tide Turning (Weekly)

Every seven days, the entire congregation gathers to perform a ceremony that influences tidal patterns across Aquabyssos. This ritual demonstrates Deep Mother's growing power over natural forces and serves as practice for larger reality-affecting ceremonies.

**Requirements**: 49 participants minimum, High [[Oracle leadership, harmonic convergence
**Duration**: 7 hours (one hour per tide cycle)
**Effect**: Tidal patterns become unpredictable, causing navigation problems for non-cultists

#### The Deep Calling (Monthly)

A major summoning ceremony designed to manifest one of Deep Mother's lesser servants. These creatures are sent to accomplish specific tasks - espionage, recruitment, elimination of threats, or reality breach creation.

**Requirements**: Blood sacrifice, 7 transformation pool preparations, stellar alignment
**Duration**: Full night (sunset to sunrise)
**Risk**: 25% chance of summoning entity more powerful than intended

#### The Reality Revision (Seasonal)

Quarterly ceremony attempting to make permanent changes to local reality. Past successes include making water flow upward in certain districts, causing buildings to exist in multiple time periods simultaneously, and creating zones where thoughts become temporary realities.

**Requirements**: Multiple reality breach sites, 343 participants, Deep Mother's direct attention
**Duration**: 49 hours of continuous ritual
**Effect**: Permanent alteration to local physics or causality

#### Novice Instruction

New cult members receive education in basic Deep Mother theology, meditation techniques, and early-stage transformation preparation. Classes held in the smaller chambers emphasize community building and gradual indoctrination.

#### Advanced Studies

Higher-ranking cultists study advanced topics: [Reality Manipulation]], temporal paradox resolution, parasitic symbiosis management, and direct communion with cosmic entities. These classes often result in visible transformation or madness.

#### The Deep Curriculum

Inner Circle members participate in educational experiences that can only be described as "learning to unlearn." Students study subjects like non-causal mathematics, impossible theology, and practical reality revision.

### Surface Knowledge

Most surface dwellers know only that:
- A cathedral sank during an earthquake 47 years ago
- The site is considered haunted by sailors
- Unusual tidal patterns occur in the area
- Deep-sea exploration attempts have had mixed success
- Local fishing has been poor since the "incident"

### Academic Understanding

Scholars and researchers have documented:
- Architectural impossibilities that violate known physics
- Acoustic anomalies affecting entire ocean region
- Temporal distortions recorded by chronographic instruments
- Gravitational anomalies suggesting mass displacement
- Biological specimens showing unknown evolutionary adaptations

### Government Intelligence

Official agencies suspect:
- Organized group using site for illegal activities
- Possible foreign influence or espionage operations
- Connection to other unusual incidents across both realms
- Threat to navigation safety and marine commerce
- Need for official investigation despite obvious dangers

### Managing Sanity Loss

The cathedral's impossible architecture should create steady sanity pressure:
- General exposure: 1 sanity loss per hour of exploration
- Specific chambers: Additional `dice: 1d4` loss for particularly disturbing areas
- Ritual observation: `dice: 1d6` loss for witnessing ceremonies
- Direct Deep Mother contact: [[`dice: 2d6`+ loss depending on communication intensity
- Philosophical revelation: Variable loss based on character's worldview changes

### Balancing Threat and Information

The cathedral should feel genuinely dangerous while providing necessary campaign information:
- Use [Npc]]s genuinely convinced they're helping visitors
- Provide valuable intelligence mixed with obvious propaganda
- Create situations where violence would be counter-productive
- Allow characters to learn through observation and interaction
- Present moral complexity rather than simple good vs evil

### Architectural Impossibilities

When describing the cathedral's aberrant architecture:
- Focus on emotional impact rather than technical explanations
- Use contradictory descriptions that somehow both make sense
- Allow different characters to perceive different versions of same space
- Emphasize how the building responds to thoughts and intentions
- Remember that impossible doesn't mean non-functional
