# Wukka Nut
*Adventuring Gear, unknown*  

- **Cost**: 1 gp
- **Weight**: ‚è§

These fist-sized nuts grow on wukka trees, which are popular haunts for [jaculi](/compendium/bestiary/beast/jaculi-toa.md), [su-monsters](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/su-monster-toa.md), and [zorbos](/compendium/bestiary/monstrosity/zorbo-toa.md). A wukka nut rattles when shaken, causing its shell to shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. This magical light fades after 1 minute, but shaking the nut again causes the light to reappear. If the shell of the nut is cracked open, it loses its magic.
