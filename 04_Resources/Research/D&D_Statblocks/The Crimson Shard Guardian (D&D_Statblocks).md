*Bound Elemental, Herald of the Blood Plague* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Once a pure water elemental summoned to cleanse the harbor, this entity has been corrupted by proximity to the [[The Seven Shards|Crimson Shard for over a century. Now a twisted guardian of blood and disease, it dwells in the sunken merchant vessel *Fortune's Folly* at the bottom of [Port Meridian|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]] harbor, spreading crystal plague through the water. ### Physical Integration

The Crimson Shard has become physically integrated with both the Guardian and the sunken vessel *Fortune's Folly*. The fragment, roughly the size of a human fist, pulses with a malevolent crimson light that can be seen from the harbor surface on dark nights. Crystalline growths spread from the Shard like a cancer, covering the ship's hull in razor-sharp crimson formations that cut through water and flesh with equal ease. The Guardian cannot exist more than a mile from the Shard - the artifact has become its anchor to this plane of existence. When the Guardian manifests fully, crimson veins of corrupted water flow directly from the Shard to its core, creating a visible tether of plague and power. This connection pulses with each heartbeat of the Shard, spreading corruption further into the harbor with every surge. ### Plague Mechanics

The crystal plague operates on multiple levels simultaneously:
- **Physical**: Crimson crystals grow from infected tissue, causing excruciating pain
- **Magical**: Drains magical energy from victims, feeding it back to the Shard
- **Spiritual**: Creates a psychic link between victims and the Guardian
- **Environmental**: Transforms water into a vector for further infection Infected individuals experience progressive symptoms:

1. **Stage 1** (Days 1-3): Fever, muscle aches, small crystal formations under skin
2. **Stage 2** (Days 4-7): Crystal growths breach skin, causing bleeding and infection
3. **Stage 3** (Week 2): Major organ dysfunction as crystals invade internal systems
4. **Stage 4** (Week 3): Complete crystallization of extremities, loss of motor function
5. **Terminal Stage**: Full transformation into crystal plague carrier, controlled by Guardian ### Harbor Ecosystem Collapse

The corruption has created a dead zone expanding outward from the sunken ship:
- **Inner Zone** (0-100 yards): No natural life survives, water is thick with plague
- **Middle Zone** (100-300 yards): Mutated creatures, aggressive and diseased
- **Outer Zone** (300-500 yards): Fish flee, early signs of infection appearing
- **Warning Zone** (500+ yards): Animals sense danger, unusual behavior patterns The harbor's economic value has plummeted as fishing becomes impossible and ships report mysterious damage to their hulls after docking. The corruption seeps into the city's water table through underground channels, threatening to transform Port Meridian into a plague city. ### Ship Layout

**Upper Deck** (Partially Collapsed)
- Crystallized rigging creates maze of razor-sharp obstacles
- Captain's cabin contains pre-corruption records and personal effects
- Crow's nest serves as Guardian's observation post
- Plague crystals grow thickest here, closest to surface **Main Deck**
- Cargo holds transformed into plague incubation chambers
- Crew quarters contain remains of original sailors
- Ship's wheel fused with crystal, still emanates navigation magic
- Hidden smuggling compartments with additional treasures **Lower Deck** - Flooded chambers where plague elementals spawn
- Ship's shrine to sea gods corrupted into Shard altar
- Ballast area contains Guardian's captured victims
- Emergency supplies cache (potions, scrolls) preserved in crystal **The Broken Figurehead** (Shard Location)
- Ornate mermaid carving split open to reveal Crimson Shard
- Crimson veins spread throughout ship from this point
- Touching figurehead directly causes immediate Stage 3 infection
- Can only be safely approached with proper magical protection ### The Crimson Shard Guardian

*Huge elemental (corrupted water), chaotic evil* **Armor Class** 17 (Natural Armor) **Hit Points** 230 (`dice: 20d12` + 100) **Speed** 0 ft., swim 90 ft. **STR** | **DEX** | **CON** | **INT** | **WIS** | **CHA**

--------|---------|---------|---------|---------|--------

22 (+6) | 14 (+2) | 20 (+5) | 8 (-1) | 16 (+3) | 12 (+1) **Saving Throws** Con +11, Wis +9 **Skills** Perception +9 **Damage Resistances** Acid, Cold, Lightning **Damage Immunities** Poison, Disease **Condition Immunities** Exhaustion, Grappled, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poisoned, Prone, Restrained **Senses** Blindsight 120 ft., passive Perception 19 **Languages** Aquan, Primordial (corrupted) **Challenge Rating** 14 (11,500 XP) **Proficiency Bonus** +5 ### Special Abilities **Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If the Guardian fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead. **Crimson Plague Aura.** Any creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the Guardian must succeed on a **DC 19** Constitution saving throw or become infected with crystal plague. Infected creatures take 7 (`dice: 2d6`) necrotic damage at the start of each turn and grow crimson crystal growths. The infection can be cured with *greater restoration* or similar magic. **Shard Resoce.** The Guardian's power increases when near Shard fragments. For each Shard fragment within 1 mile, it gains +1 AC, +10 hit points, and +1 to damage rolls. **Water Form.** The Guardian can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature's space on a turn, that creature must make a **DC 19** Strength saving throw. On failure, the creature is engulfed and takes 13 (`dice: 3d8`) acid damage. Engulfed creatures are restrained and take 13 (`dice: 3d8`) acid damage at the start of each turn. **Bound to the Shard.** The Guardian cannot move more than 1 mile from the Crimson Shard. If the Shard is removed or destroyed, the Guardian begins to purify over 24 hours, potentially returning to its original water elemental nature. ### Actions **Multiattack.** The Guardian makes two Crimson Slam attacks. **Crimson Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (`dice: 3d8` + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (`dice: 2d8`) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a **DC 19** Constitution saving throw or be infected with crystal plague. **Plague Wave (Recharge 5-6).** The Guardian creates a 60-foot radius wave of diseased crimson water. All creatures in the area must make a **DC 19** Constitution saving throw. On failure, they take 27 (`dice: 6d8`) necrotic damage and are infected with crystal plague. On success, they take half damage and aren't infected. **Summon Plague Elementals (1/Day).** The Guardian spawns `dice: 1d4` Small plague water elementals (AC 14, 26 HP, +7 to hit, `dice: 1d6`+4 acid damage plus crystal plague infection) that last for 10 minutes. **Crimson Binding (1/Day).** The Guardian attempts to drag a creature into the harbor depths. One creature within 60 feet must make a **DC 19** Strength saving throw. On failure, they are pulled 30 feet toward the Guardian and restrained by crimson water tendrils. Restrained creatures take 13 (`dice: 3d8`) acid damage at the start of each turn. ### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)

The Guardian can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. **Move.** The Guardian moves up to its speed. **Crimson Slam.** The Guardian makes one Crimson Slam attack. **Corruption Pulse (Costs 2 Actions).** All creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a **DC 17** Constitution saving throw or take 9 (`dice: 2d8`) necrotic damage. **Plague Spread (Costs 3 Actions).** The Guardian's plague aura expands to 120 feet radius until the start of its next turn. ### Lair Actions

When fought in Port Meridian harbor, the Guardian can take lair actions on initiative count 20: **Corrupted Current.** Strong currents pull all creatures in the water 30 feet in a direction of the Guardian's choice. **Harbor Plague.** The entire harbor becomes difficult terrain as crimson crystals emerge from the water. **Shard Resoce.** If the Crimson Shard is present, the Guardian regains 20 hit points and all creatures within 100 feet must save against crystal plague infection. --- ### The Original Summoning
