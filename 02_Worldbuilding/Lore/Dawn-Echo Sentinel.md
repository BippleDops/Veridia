# Dawn-Echo Sentinel

*"When first light touches deep water, the guardian awakens to its vigil."*

## Overview
The Dawn-Echo Sentinel is a unique magical construct that activates at sunrise, using the resonance between surface dawn and underwater acoustics to patrol and protect designated areas. This sentinel combines light-based magic with sonic abilities, creating protective barriers and warning systems that function across the boundary between realms.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
- Daily solar activation cycle
- Acoustic resonance chambers for sound amplification
- Crystal focusing lenses for light channeling
- Designated patrol area with clear boundaries

### Effects
- **Light Barriers**: Creates protective walls of concentrated sunlight
- **Echo Location**: Maps entire area through sonic pulses
- **Intruder Detection**: Identifies unauthorized presences
- **Communication Relay**: Transmits messages between surface and depth

### Duration
Active from dawn to dusk, dormant during nighttime hours.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Sentinel Malfunction**: Guardian begins attacking authorized personnel
2. **Construction Mission**: Install new sentinel in dangerous area
3. **Stealth Challenge**: Bypass sentinel detection during infiltration

## Campaign Use
Provides area defense, patrol encounters, and technological mystery elements.
