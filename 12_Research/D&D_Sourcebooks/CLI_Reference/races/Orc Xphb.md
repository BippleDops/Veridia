### Adrenaline Rush

You can take the [[actions#Dash|Dash]] action as a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]]. When you do so, you gain a number of [[temporary-hit-points-xphb|Temporary Hit Points]] equal to your [[proficiency-xphb|Proficiency Bonus]].

You can use this trait a number of times equal to your [[proficiency-xphb|Proficiency Bonus]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[short-rest-xphb|Short]] or [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]].

When you are reduced to 0 [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Point]] instead. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]].

## Description

Orcs trace their creation to Gruumsh, a powerful god who roamed the wide open spaces of the Material Plane. Gruumsh equipped his children with gifts to help them wander great plains, vast caverns, and churning seas and to face the monsters that lurk there. Even when they turn their devotion to other gods, orcs retain Gruumsh's gifts: endurance, determination, and the ability to see in darkness.

Orcs are, on average, tall and broad. They have gray skin, ears that are sharply pointed, and prominent lower canines that resemble small tusks. Orc youths on some worlds are told about their ancestors' great travels and travails. Inspired by those tales, many of those orcs wonder when Gruumsh will call on them to match the heroic deeds of old and if they will prove worthy of his favor. Other orcs are happy to leave old tales in the past and find their own way.
