This frontier outpost controls the vital Tradeway Road, the primary route for caravans carrying rare minerals from the Crystalline Wastes, exotic goods from distant underwater kingdoms, and essential supplies to isolated communities scattered throughout the northern reaches. Recently, [Caravan Master Dolrim|02 Worldbuilding/People/Caravan Master Dolrim]] has reported increasingly severe problems affecting trade through Northgate. Merchant caravans are disappearing without trace, hostile creatures are massing in unusual numbers, and strange lights have been seen in the deep wilderness beyond the settlement's protective barriers. More troubling still, diplomatic communications with neighboring territories have ceased entirely, suggesting that Northgate may soon find itself isolated and under siege. The town's garrison commander has requested immediate assistance from experienced adventurers to investigate the threats, restore safe passage along the trade routes, and determine whether the mounting dangers represent random frontier hazards or coordinated attacks by an organized enemy. The party will need to navigate complex political relationships between competing merchant factions, deal with suspicious townspeople who distrust outsiders, and venture into unexplored wilderness areas where ancient dangers may be stirring. Success in securing Northgate will ensure the continued flow of trade that sustains dozens of communities throughout the northern frontier, while failure could result in the economic collapse of the entire region and leave thousands of settlers defenseless against whatever hostile forces are gathering in the wilderness. The quest combines elements of wilderness exploration, diplomatic negotiation, and frontier survival as the party works to understand and neutralize threats that could reshape the balance of power in northern Aquabyssos. ### Primary Objectives

**Secure the Trade Routes**: Investigate the disappearance of merchant caravans along the Tradeway Road and eliminate whatever threats are preventing safe passage. This requires wilderness tracking skills, combat capability, and the ability to work effectively with merchant escorts and trading company representatives. **Restore Diplomatic Communications**: Re-establish contact with neighboring territories and allied settlements that have gone silent, determining whether they have been destroyed, conquered, or simply cut off from communication. This may involve dangerous journeys through hostile territory and delicate negotiations with suspicious or hostile leaders. **Identify the Source of the Threat**: Determine whether the mounting dangers around Northgate represent natural wilderness hazards, organized bandit activity, hostile government actions, or more exotic threats such as ancient magical awakening or extraplanar invasion. **Strengthen Northgate's Defenses**: Work with the garrison commander and local leaders to improve the settlement's ability to withstand attack while maintaining its role as a trading hub. This may involve military planning, resource allocation, and diplomatic agreements with allied forces. ### Secondary Objectives

**Investigate the Strange Phenomena**: Explore reports of unusual lights, sounds, and activities in the deep wilderness beyond Northgate, gathering intelligence about potential threats while avoiding dangerous encounters with unknown entities. **Resolve Factional Conflicts**: Mediate disputes between competing merchant organizations, government representatives, and local settlers that are undermining Northgate's unity and effectiveness in dealing with external threats. **Locate Missing Personnel**: Search for disappeared scouts, traders, and messengers whose knowledge could provide crucial intelligence about the nature and scope of the threats facing the settlement. **Establish Supply Lines**: Organize alternative routes and supply sources to ensure Northgate can continue functioning even if primary trade routes remain compromised. ### Caravan Master Dolrim

The resolution of the Northgate crisis has lasting implications for the campaign world's economic and political development. Success creates opportunities for frontier exploration and expansion, while failure may result in the economic collapse of northern settlements and increased isolation of remote communities. The party's choices about how to handle threats, negotiate with different factions, and balance competing interests establish their reputation and influence in frontier politics. ### The Inside Threat

Investigation reveals that some of the attacks on caravans and settlements are being coordinated by trusted insiders - garrison officers, merchant leaders, or government officials who have been compromised through bribery, coercion, or ideological conversion. This forces the party to question their allies and navigate complex webs of deception. ### The Ancient Awakening

The strange phenomena in the wilderness are connected to ancient magical sites or sleeping entities that are awakening due to increased activity in the region. The "attacks" on settlements may actually be defensive reactions by creatures protecting their territory from what they perceive as invasion. ### The Diplomatic Solution

The hostile forces threatening Northgate turn out to be representatives of a legitimate government or organization with valid grievances against Aquabyssos trade policies or territorial expansion. Resolution may require complex negotiations rather than military action. ### The Greater Threat

The attacks on Northgate are revealed to be preparatory actions for a much larger invasion or conquest attempt. The party must decide whether to focus on defending the immediate area or attempt to strike at the source of the threat before it becomes overwhelming. ### The Economic Warfare

The threats against trade routes are being orchestrated by competing commercial interests who seek to redirect profitable trade through territories they control. Resolution requires understanding complex economic relationships and may involve corporate espionage or trade war tactics. ### Lower Level Groups (2-4)

Focus on investigation and negotiation rather than direct combat with major threats. Reduce the scope of the crisis to affect only Northgate itself rather than the entire region. Provide more support from NPC allies and limit wilderness exploration to areas close to the settlement. ### Higher Level Groups (8-12)

Expand the scope to include planar threats, ancient artifacts of significant power, and political implications that affect multiple regions or nations. Include more complex magical phenomena and opportunities for high-level diplomatic or military solutions. ### Combat-Heavy Groups

Add more direct encounters with organized enemy forces, wilderness creatures, and opportunities for tactical combat involving settlement defense and caravan escort operations. Include siege scenarios and large-scale battle opportunities. ### Diplomacy-Focused Groups

Emphasize negotiation with multiple competing factions, complex political relationships, and opportunities to resolve conflicts through persuasion and compromise rather than force. Develop deeper characterization for merchant leaders and political figures. ### The Military Victory

The party identifies and defeats the hostile forces threatening the trade routes through direct military action, coordinated with garrison forces and allied settlements. This approach emphasizes combat effectiveness and strategic planning. **Requirements**: Strong combat abilities, alliance with military forces, intelligence about enemy positions and capabilities. **Outcomes**: Trade routes secured through force, potential for ongoing military cooperation, establishment of the party as regional military leaders. ### The Diplomatic Resolution

Investigation reveals that the threats can be resolved through negotiation and compromise between competing interests. This approach emphasizes understanding different viewpoints and finding mutually acceptable solutions. **Requirements**: High social skills, understanding of different faction motivations, ability to facilitate complex negotiations. **Outcomes**: Lasting peace through diplomatic agreements, enhanced reputation for wisdom and fairness, ongoing involvement in regional politics. ### The Economic Solution

The party resolves the crisis by reorganizing trade relationships, establishing new commercial partnerships, and creating economic incentives that make cooperation more profitable than conflict. **Requirements**: Understanding of trade relationships, access to significant resources, ability to create binding commercial agreements. **Outcomes**: Economic prosperity for all parties, ongoing involvement in trade network management, establishment of the party as regional commercial leaders. ### The Supernatural Resolution

The threats are revealed to have supernatural or extraplanar origins that require magical or scholarly solutions rather than conventional diplomatic or military approaches. **Requirements**: Magical knowledge and abilities, research skills, access to ancient knowledge or artifacts. **Outcomes**: Resolution of supernatural threats, acquisition of magical knowledge and abilities, ongoing responsibilities for managing planar or magical phenomena. ### The Sacrificial Choice

The crisis cannot be completely resolved without significant costs - the party must choose what to sacrifice (economic prosperity, military security, political independence, or supernatural safety) to preserve other values. **Requirements**: Difficult moral choices, acceptance of partial solutions, ability to manage ongoing consequences. **Outcomes**: Complex ongoing situation with both benefits and drawbacks, reputation for making difficult decisions, continued involvement in managing the consequences of their choices. This quest provides opportunities for wilderness exploration, political intrigue, and economic problem-solving while establishing the party's role in frontier development and regional politics. The resolution chosen will have lasting effects on the northern frontier's development and create precedents for handling similar crises in other border regions throughout the Aquabyssos campaign setting. ## Player-Facing Summary Northgate is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
