## Description
A game also called backgammon, this is a popular bar game in the Dalelands, and has spread by trade routes through the Heartlands and into the North. Our set is made of polished white and black markers, ivory [[Dice|dice]], fine leather [[Dice|dice]] cups, and carried in a finely-worked case of sturdy ironwood. Make yourself at home in the taverns of the civilized world with a Table Dice set from Auroraâ€™s, at the low cost of 5 gp.
