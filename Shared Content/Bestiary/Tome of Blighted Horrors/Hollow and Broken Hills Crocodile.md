## Special Traits
**Charming Gemstone:** A creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the crocodile, or that moves to within 30 feet on its turn, must make a successful DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by the crocodile for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A charmed creature repeats the saving throw when it takes damage.

**Hold Breath:** The crocodile can hold its breath for 30 minutes.

**Lunging Bite (recharge 6):** The crocodile extends the reach of its bite attack by 5 feet until the start of its next turn (no action required).

**Spell-like Abilities:** The crocodile’s green gemstone eyes enable it to use the following spell-like abilities, using Charisma as its casting ability (DC 14). The crocodile needs no components to use these abilities. 2/day each: fear, hypnotic pattern, suggestion 1/day: modify memory

**Water Camouflage:** The crocodile has tactical advantage on Stealth checks while in water.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The Hollow and Broken Hills crocodile can use one spell-like ability and make both a bite attack and a tail swipe.

**Melee Attack—Bite:** +10 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 3d10 + 6` piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16) and restrained. A restrained creature takes `dice: 3d10 + 6` piercing damage at the start of the rocodile’s turn. The crocodile can’t bite another creature while it has a creature grappled, and it can grapple only one creature at a time.

**Melee Attack—Tail Swipe:** +10 to hit (reach 10 ft.; one creature not grappled by the crocodile). Hit: `dice: 2d8 + 6` bludgeoning damage, and the creature must make a successful DC 18 Str saving throw or be knocked prone.

## Description
**Environment**: Sea (the Blight)

**Organization**: Solitary

The aged clergyman Neberiah Scrum was renowned for the fine herpetarium that he kept behind his modest church. If it made any of his parishioners nervous with its proximity, he never bothered to notice. His prized specimen was his saltwater crocodile “Nellie” that he had obtained at considerable expense. Feeding it live gulls in its pen every Prayerday after services was a hobby that he particularly relished. But apparently the Good Reverend Scrum had other hobbies as well, and these occurred at night behind the closed doors of the church and involved strange rituals. On one occasion, he decided to combine his two favorite pastimes and brought Nellie into the church on a chain leash for one of these late-night ceremonies. The next day, the church was found locked. Upon forcing the door, the constables found the Reverend Scrum lying dead upon the floor, along with the corpses of four other, unidentifiable men. Their bodies lay roughly in a circle with the fragments of a shattered mirror lying between them next to a chain leash. Of Nellie, there was no sign. The herpetarium was torn down, its occupants sold or released, and the church was repurposed as a storage building for uncertified relics — the bones, grave shrouds, and assorted organs and body parts dried or stored in jars of brine and ascribed to belong to saints for whom the church has been unable to confirm provenance.

In that last fateful ritual performed in the church, somehow Reverend Scrum’s beloved pet slipped into Between. She remained there for 8 hours before finding her way back to the city, and, upon her return, she was no longer the same. Nellie had become the Hollow and Broken Hills

Crocodile. The effects upon Nellie’s body were remarkable: her eyes replaced by two large jewels of unidentifiable stone, her body infused with the very essence of that realm. But the effects upon her mind were far more profound. The Hollow and Broken Hills Crocodile had gained a new awareness, an awareness above and beyond that of the mundane world and its hairless monkey masters. The Hollow and Broken Hills Crocodile was given the ability to “see” in a way that normal minds cannot comprehend.

The crocodile now haunts the waterways and brackish pools that make up the lower reaches of the Broken and Hollow Hills, occasionally glimpsed by some passer-by. It is not a hunter like other creatures that stalk the city, or at least not in the same way. The crocodile lurks in the dark, wet places of the district, remaining almost motionless for days on end. When it feels hunger, it merely opens its great maw and some river trout or gull inevitably ventures inward of its own volition, disappearing into the maw as it slowly closes — never a squawk or a splash to disturb the silence. At times, every few weeks or months the crocodile springs into motion, suddenly needing to be somewhere or do some task that only its mind comprehends. But there are no warning signs of when it’s about to make these sudden violent movements, so more than one fisherman has been crippled or killed when what he thought was a log floating nearby suddenly became a flurry of motion with its 2,000-pound frame bull rushing on its way, heedless of its surroundings. Also, after reports of the crocodile’s sudden thrashing appearances and subsequent disappearances, inevitably a citizen or two of the district will go missing. No one knows for sure if these disappearances are connected to the activities of the crocodile, but the missing are never found and speculation tends to run in that vein.

The green gemstone eyes of the Hollow and Broken Hills Crocodile are of no known mineral and are an organic part of the creature’s body, rather than just being inset like jewelry. Most of its supernatural abilities seem to arise from the gemstones. The gemstone eyes no longer function if removed from the crocodile, though they may still be of value to some scholars.

What the Hollow and Broken Hills Crocodile sees with its gemstone eyes remains a mystery to all, but those who study things esoteric speculate as to the nature of the secrets that they might reveal. That the creature has been to Between and back, beginning as an ordinary animal and returning as something else entirely further fuels interest among those who practice strange, arcane arts. Because the Hollow and Broken Hills Crocodile does not seem to actively prey upon the folk of Castorhage, the city has taken a more ambivalent approach toward its existence. There is only a 1,000-gp reward for its capture or death, but the Illuminati have discreetly offered 10,000 gp to anyone who can bring it to them alive and intact.

The Hollow and Broken Hills Crocodile is 23 feet long and weighs 2,000 pounds. Other than its strange eyes and mannerisms, it physically resembles a massive saltwater crocodile, though it flourishes as well in the brackish waters of the district and the Lyme. Though it carries the Between-touched template from the time it spent in that realm, it long ago lost its temporary hit points associated with that template and has never been able to return to Between to replenish them.
