# 1359 - Conflict in the Bloodstone Lands
## Overview
**Date**: Sunday, 1 January 1358 12:00:00 AM

Following a decade of war, the [[Lich|lich]] Zhengyi the Witch-King and his armies of monstrous humanoids from Vaasa and undead creatures took control of Damara in 1357 DR. Gareth Dragonsbane, a Paladin of the Golden Cup, eventually united the people of Damara into a formidable army and led them against the forces of Vaasa in 1359 DR. During the struggle against the followers of Zhengyi, Gareth was named the King of Damara. Gareth and a group of intrepid adventurers soon managed to liberate Damara from Zhengyiâ€™s oppressive rule and destroy the undead [[Mage|mage]] at his stronghold, Castle Perilous.
