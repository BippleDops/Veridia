# Deep Mother Sanity System

*"The mind breaks before the truth, but the truth remains."*

## Overview

The Deep Mother Sanity System tracks characters' mental stability when confronted with eldritch truths, reality distortions, and the existential horror of the Deep Mother's influence. Unlike traditional madness mechanics, this system recognizes that exposure to cosmic truth fundamentally changes how characters understand reality - sometimes this knowledge is beneficial, sometimes devastating, but it's always permanent.

## Core Mechanics

### Sanity Points
Characters have Sanity Points equal to their Wisdom score + their level (minimum 10). These represent their ability to maintain their current understanding of reality when faced with contradictory evidence.

**Maximum Sanity**: Wisdom score + character level  
**Starting Sanity**: Maximum Sanity  
**Minimum Sanity**: Cannot drop below 0

### Sanity Saves
When exposed to Deep Mother phenomena, characters make Sanity saves:
- **Attribute**: Wisdom-based save
- **Proficiency**: Add proficiency bonus if proficient in Wisdom saves
- **Success**: Take half damage (minimum 1)
- **Failure**: Take full sanity damage
- **Critical Failure (1)**: Take maximum damage + temporary madness
- **Critical Success (20)**: Take no damage + gain insight

### Sanity Damage Categories

#### Minor Exposure (1d4 Sanity damage)
- Witnessing impossible geometry
- Hearing whispers in empty rooms
- Finding objects that shouldn't exist
- Minor reality distortions
- First encounter with transformed cultist

#### Moderate Exposure (1d6 Sanity damage)
- Direct communication with eldritch entity
- Experiencing temporal displacement
- Witnessing death that doesn't make sense
- Reading cursed texts
- Exposure to avatar presence

#### Major Exposure (2d6 Sanity damage)
- Seeing avatar manifestation directly
- Understanding fundamental truth about reality
- Experiencing ego dissolution
- Witnessing reality breach creation
- Learning Deep Mother's true nature

#### Extreme Exposure (3d6 Sanity damage)
- Direct contact with Deep Mother's consciousness
- Witnessing reality's complete breakdown
- Understanding the futility of existence
- Experiencing true cosmic perspective
- Becoming temporarily one with Deep Mother

#### Absolute Exposure (4d6 Sanity damage)
- Comprehending Deep Mother's full nature
- Witnessing the end of all things
- Understanding that reality is temporary
- Experiencing complete ego death
- Learning the final truth

## Sanity Loss Consequences

### Indefinite Madness (Until cured)
Triggered by losing 50% of current sanity in single event:

## Sanity Recovery

## Special Conditions

- Detect lies and deceptions instantly
- Know when reality breaches occur within 10 miles
- Understand the true names of eldritch entities
- Cannot be surprised by supernatural events

- **Dream Communication**: Can send messages through the dream realm

### Cosmic Enlightenment
Some characters embrace their sanity loss and gain positive benefits:

- **Reality Walker**: Can navigate reality breaches safely
- **Deep Speaker**: Communicate with Deep Mother entities without immediate harm
- **Paradox Resolver**: Understand and explain supernatural events to others

## Integration with Deep Mother System

### Influence Correlation
As Deep Mother's influence grows, sanity becomes harder to maintain:

| Deep Mother Influence | Sanity Save Modifier |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| 0-20% | Normal |
| 21-40% | -1 to all sanity saves |
| 41-60% | -2 to all sanity saves |  
| 61-80% | -3 to all sanity saves |
| 81-99% | -4 to all sanity saves |
| 100% | Automatic failure |

### Avatar Encounters
Each avatar type causes specific sanity damage:

| Avatar | Save DC | Damage | Special Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|----------------|
| Drowned Queen | 18 | 2d6 | Temporary aquatic madness |
| Parasitic Mass | 19 | 2d6+2 | Risk of parasitic infection |
| Crystal Heart | 17 | 2d6 | Crystallization obsession |
| Void Prophet | 22 | 3d6 | Prophetic overload |
| Final Form | 25 | 4d6 | Immediate transcendence |

### Cult Indoctrination
Willing exposure to Deep Mother influence can reduce sanity damage:
- **Outer Circle**: -2 to sanity damage from minor exposure
- **Fourth Circle**: -3 to sanity damage from moderate exposure  
- **Third Circle**: -4 to sanity damage from major exposure
- **Second Circle**: Immune to sanity damage from willing exposure
- **Inner Circle**: Gain sanity points from cosmic revelations

## Character Creation Options

### Sanity-Related Backgrounds
- **Asylum Survivor**: Start with 75% normal sanity, advantage on saves vs madness
- **Cosmic Scholar**: Start with cosmic awareness, disadvantage on social interactions

### Class Modifications
- **Clerics**: Channel Divinity to restore sanity in others
- **Warlocks**: May have Deep Mother patron - different sanity mechanics
- **Wizards**: Can research cosmic truths safely with proper precautions
- **Druids**: Natural connection provides resistance to reality distortion

## Campaign Integration

### Sanity as Resource
Treat sanity as expendable resource for power:
- Voluntarily lose sanity to boost spell save DCs
- Trade sanity for prophetic knowledge
- Sacrifice sanity to power reality-altering effects
- Use madness states as temporary supernatural abilities

### Group Sanity
Track party's collective mental health:
- **Stable Group**: All members above 50% - bonus to group checks
- **Unstable Group**: Mixed sanity levels - internal conflicts
- **Mad Group**: All members below 25% - dangerous but insightful
- **Lost Group**: NPCs, but potentially useful allies

### Sanity Economy
Create systems where sanity has value:
- Information brokers accept sanity as payment
- Magical items powered by madness
- NPCs provide services in exchange for "interesting perspectives"
- Cosmic entities bargain for human mental energy

## Player-Facing Guidelines

### Playing Low Sanity Characters
- Embrace the strangeness - low sanity provides unique insights
- Work with DM to make madness interesting, not disruptive
- Use prophetic abilities to help the party
- Remember that your character has access to truths others can't see

### Maintaining Sanity
- Seek normal human connections and activities
- Document experiences to maintain sense of continuity  
- Create rituals that reinforce identity and reality
- Build support network of people who understand

### Warning Signs
Players should recognize when their character approaches dangerous sanity levels and make informed decisions about risk vs reward.

## DM Guidelines

### Sanity as Narrative Tool
- Use sanity loss to create character development opportunities
- Madness should reveal truth, not just create chaos
- Low sanity characters can become incredible assets
- Balance horror with empowerment

### Pacing Sanity Loss
- Early campaign: Minor exposure only
- Mid campaign: Moderate exposure, first major losses
- Late campaign: Regular major exposure, crisis decisions
- Endgame: Characters choose between sanity and saving reality

### Supporting Player Agency
- Never force permanent character changes without warning
- Provide multiple paths for sanity recovery
- Make madness interesting and useful, not just penalties
- Allow players to embrace cosmic awareness if they choose
