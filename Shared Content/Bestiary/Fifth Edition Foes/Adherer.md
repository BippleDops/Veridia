## Special Traits
**Adhesive:** An adherer exudes a sour smelling, gluelike substance that is a powerful adhesive. Any creatures or items that touch it, except for items made of stone, become stuck to the adherer. The adherer automatically grapples and restrains any creature it hits with its slam attack. It can grapple up to two opponents at one time. Gtrappling does not reduce the adherer's number of attacks. Creatures grappled this way can break free with a successful DC 15 Strength saving throw.

A weapon that strikes an adherer is stuck to the creature unless the wielder succeeds on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. Pulling a stuck weapon free requires a successful DC 12 Strength saving throw.

Boiling water thrown on the adherer deals 3 (`dice: 1d6`) points of damage to it and to any creature grappled by the adherer. It also grants tactical advantage on Dexterity saving throw and Strength saving throw to free a weapon or to escape from the adherer's grapple; this bonus lasts for one round. Inflicting fire damage on the adherer also weakens the adhesive, granting tactical advantage on Dexterity saving throw and Strength check for `dice: 1d3` rounds. Universal solvent dissolves the adhesive instantly. An adherer can dissolve its adhesive at will, and the substance breaks down naturally one hour after the creature dies.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The adherer slams twice.

**Melee Attack—Slam:** +4 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d8 + 2` bludgeoning damage, and the target creature is grappled and restrained (see Adhesive).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate forests and subterranean

**Organization**: Solitary or gang (2–4)

## Description
Adherers are strange creatures found in forests and extensive cavern networks. They stand 6 feet tall, weigh about 200 pounds, and closely resemble mummies. The difference is obvious on close inspection, but from more than 10 feet away, a successful DC 20 Int (Nature) check is needed to discern the difference. They are not in fact related to mummies, nor are they undead. Adherers are malign, living creatures that attack just about any other creature they encounter.

Adherers always attack from ambush. When lying in wait, an adherer covers its body with leaves, sticks, or other natural debris to blend with its surroundings. When prey wanders too close, the adherer springs to the attack. In this type of ambush, adherers always have tactical advantage on their Stealth checks to determine surprise (+5). They are cowardly creatures, however, and if spotted before they can spring their ambush, they flee.
