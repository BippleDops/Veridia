## üéØ Adventure Opportunities

### Immediate Hooks
${eventDetails.immediateHooks}

### Investigation Angles
1. **Who Benefits?** - Follow the money and power to find hidden orchestrators
2. **Information Warfare** - Gather intelligence on all parties' true positions
3. **Damage Control** - Help factions manage public relations and minimize losses
4. **Mediation Opportunity** - Serve as neutral arbitrators in negotiations
5. **Exploitation Potential** - Use the chaos to advance party's own agenda

### Long-term Implications
- **New Power Structures**: How will the political landscape change?
- **Alliance Shifts**: Which relationships will strengthen or break?
- **Economic Disruption**: What businesses will succeed or fail?
- **Social Change**: How will public opinion and daily life change?
- **Foreign Relations**: Will other cities/kingdoms see opportunity or threat?
