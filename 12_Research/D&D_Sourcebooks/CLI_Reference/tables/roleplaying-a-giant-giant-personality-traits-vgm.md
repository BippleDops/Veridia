|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | The brutality of my peers is a relic of a bygone era that should be stamped out. I seek a more enlightened path. |
| 2 | As the most powerful beings in creation, we have a duty to use our strength for the benefit of all. |
| 3 | I take what I want. I don't care who gets hurt. |
| 4 | A giant lives for a few centuries, but giantkind is eternal. Everything I do is to glorify my ancestors and make my descendants proud. |
| 5 | Dragons are my mortal enemies. Everything I do is to ensure their destruction. |
| 6 | I measure a creature's worth by its size. The small folk are beneath my concern. |
