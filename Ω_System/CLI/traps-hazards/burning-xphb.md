# Burning
*Generic Hazard*  

A burning creature or object takes `d4` Fire damage at the start of each of its turns. As an action, you can extinguish fire on yourself by giving yourself the [Prone](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Prone) condition and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated.
