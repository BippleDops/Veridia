## Special Traits
**Regeneration:** At the start of its turn, a [[Gallows Tree|gallows tree]] zombie regains 5 lost hit points. This ability fails to function if the creature has been severed from its gallows tree (see Tether Vine, above).

**Tether Vine:** A [[Gallows Tree|gallows tree]] zombie is connected to the gallows tree that created it by a sinewy vine. This vine can be lengthened to allow the zombie to move up to 100 feet from the tree. The vine has AC 14 and 10 hit points. Harming the vine deals no damage to the gallows tree zombie or the gallows tree, but if severed, does prevent the zombie from using its regeneration.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A [[Gallows Tree|gallows tree]] zombie attacks once with its fists and can create one spore cloud.

**Fists:** *Melee Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (`dice: 2d8+4`) bludgeoning damage.

**Spore Cloud (Recharge 5—6):** Area Attack: automatic hit, range 5 ft. cube adjacent to zombie, creatures in cube. Hit: a creature in the cloud of spores must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw or suffer the effect of a slow spell lasting 6 rounds (no concentration required). When the slow effect ends, the target takes 4 (`dice: 1d8`) poison damage, or half damage with a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate and warm forest, hill, marsh, and plains

**Organization**: Grove (6–11 [[Gallows Tree|gallows tree]] zombies plus 1 gallows tree)

## Description
[[Gallows Tree|Gallows tree]] zombies were once living humanoids, but they were slain and devoured by a gallows tree and reborn from its seedlings as one of its minions. Their new purpose is killing or capturing prey for the gallows tree that created them to devour.

These monsters retain small memories of their former lives, and these scenes sometimes manifest in the zombie’s mind when they see living creatures similar to what the zombie once was. This triggers great anger that the zombie vents on the nearest living creature.

Gallows tree zombies appear as humanoid creatures with deathly gray skin that is coarse, like tree bark. A long, sinewy cord of greenish-brown wraps around the zombie’s throat and connects it to the gallows tree. Gallows tree zombies show no spark of life in their eyes, but they are not completely mindless. Neither are they undead, even though their name suggests otherwise; therefore, they can’t be turned.

Gallows tree zombies hang motionless from the tree that created them, being lowered to the ground only when a living creature comes within 100 feet of the gallows tree they are connected to. They relentlessly pound their foes with their clublike fists while belching out clouds of choking spores. The zombies prefer uneven odds that favor them, so ganging up on an individual is their norm in battle. Slain foes are dragged to the gallows tree to be devoured, implanted with a seed, and eventually transformed into a gallows tree zombie to replace any that fell in battle.
