# The Last Priest

*"When faith dies, what remains but the faithful?"*

## Overview
Father Aquilus Deepprayer is the sole remaining priest of the Old Faith, a religious tradition that once dominated Aquabyssos before political changes led to its suppression. He maintains a hidden shrine in the deepest parts of the city, serving any who still remember the old ways.

Once part of a thriving religious hierarchy, he now stands alone as keeper of ancient rites, forbidden knowledge, and the spiritual needs of those who reject the new state-approved religion.

## Background
Father Aquilus served in the Great Temple when the Old Faith was still legal. Political pressure from the crown led to religious persecution, forcing most priests to convert, flee, or face imprisonment. He chose to remain, going underground to serve the faithful.

For fifteen years, he has maintained his calling in secret, performing marriages, funerals, and other rites for those who still believe.

- Train successors to carry on after his death
- See religious freedom restored to Aquabyssos
- Find peace between old and new religious traditions

## Current Challenges
- Increasing government pressure and surveillance
- Failing health with limited access to medical care
- Dwindling congregation as older believers die
- Internal debate about whether to flee or stay
- Difficulty finding trustworthy new believers

## Potential Character Development
**Ally**: Valuable source of forbidden knowledge and spiritual guidance
**Quest Giver**: Can provide missions involving religious artifacts or persecution
**Tragic Figure**: Represents loss of cultural heritage and religious freedom
**Mentor**: Can teach characters about faith, sacrifice, and standing for principles

## Death and Legacy
If Father Aquilus dies, his death could galvanize the underground faith community or lead to its final dissolution. His hidden shrine and library represent irreplaceable cultural and religious heritage.

## DM Notes
The Last Priest embodies themes of faith versus authority, cultural preservation, and personal sacrifice. Use him to explore religious freedom, the cost of standing up for beliefs, and the value of tradition in changing times.
