## Lore Details

Legends speak of The Real Marina as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Real Marina.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties The Real Marina to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at The Real Marina to avert a public scandal.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
