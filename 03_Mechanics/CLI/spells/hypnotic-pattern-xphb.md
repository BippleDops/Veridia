# Hypnotic Pattern
*3rd-level, Illusion*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a pinch of confetti)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a twisting pattern of colors in a 30-foot [Cube](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who can see the pattern must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the [Charmed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed) condition for the duration. While [Charmed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Charmed), the creature has the [Incapacitated](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition and a [Speed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) of 0.

The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
