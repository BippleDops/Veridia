**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

## Effects
You cause one natural place to exert a special fascination to all creatures other than yourself and those native to the area.

A creature will fight fiercely if some-one attempts to make it leave the area, but will otherwise remain there peacefully.
