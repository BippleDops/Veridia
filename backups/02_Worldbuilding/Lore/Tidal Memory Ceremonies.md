# Tidal Memory Ceremonies
*"The tide remembers all things - in its flow and ebb, we store our joys and sorrows until the ocean itself becomes our eternal archive."*

## Overview
Tidal Memory Ceremonies represent the most sacred religious practices in Aquabyssos, where ocean rhythms serve as both timekeeper and memory storage system. These ancient rituals bind individual and collective memories to tidal cycles, creating a living archive where personal experiences, cultural history, and spiritual wisdom are preserved in the very heartbeat of the sea.
