## Special Abilities

**Beacon Sight.** Alaric can see clearly through any weather conditions out to 5 miles, and can detect invisible creatures within 120 feet. He can also sense the approach of storms, shadow manifestations, and dimensional rifts up to 24 hours in advance.

**Storm's Eye.** Alaric is immune to being blinded or deafened by weather effects. He can move through difficult terrain caused by weather at normal speed, and has advantage on all saves against weather-based magical effects.

**Lighthouse Bond.** While within 1 mile of his lighthouse, Alaric can cast *sending* at will to communicate with ships at sea, and can use his action to cause the lighthouse beam to flash coded warnings visible from 10 miles away.

**Guardian's Vigil.** Alaric requires only 4 hours of sleep and can maintain watch during long rests. He has advantage on Initiative rolls and cannot be surprised while conscious.

**Crystal Resonance.** Alaric can attune to crystal formations to enhance his lighthouse's beam, creating effects similar to *daylight*, *faerie fire*, or *detect magic* within the lighthouse's range.

**Fey Ancestry.** Advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put him to sleep.

**Spellcasting (Ranger).** Alaric is a 13th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit). He has the following spells prepared:
- 1st level (4 slots): *fog cloud*, *detect magic*, *cure wounds*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *misty step*, *pass without trace*, *water breathing*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *call lightning*, *wind wall*, *water walk*
- 4th level (1 slot): *freedom of movement*, *locate creature*

**Warlock Spells (Pact of the Great Old One - The Storm Eternal).** Alaric knows the following warlock spells:
- Cantrips (at will): *eldritch blast*, *prestidigitation*, *minor illusion*
- 5th level (2 slots): *hold monster*, *scrying*, *telekinesis*

## Actions

**Multiattack.** Alaric makes two attacks with his Storm Harpoon or casts a spell and makes one attack.

**Storm Harpoon.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) lightning damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength save or be pulled 20 feet toward Alaric.

**Weather Caller (3/Day).** Alaric calls upon the storm. Choose one effect:
- **Fog Bank:** Creates a 60-foot radius area of heavily obscured fog for 10 minutes
- **Lightning Strike:** Calls down lightning at a point within 120 feet. All creatures in a 10-foot radius take 28 (8d6) lightning damage (DC 18 Dex save for half)
- **Gale Force:** 30-foot cone of fierce wind pushes creatures back 20 feet and knocks them prone (DC 18 Str save negates)

**Lighthouse Beam (1/Day).** Alaric activates his lighthouse's crystal-enhanced beam. All creatures in a 120-foot cone must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution save or be blinded for 1 minute. Undead, fiends, and shadow creatures take 21 (6d6) radiant damage and are frightened for 1 minute on a failed save.

**Navigator's Mark (3/Day).** Alaric marks a creature he can see within 60 feet. For the next hour, he knows the exact direction and distance to that creature, and his attacks against it have advantage.

## Description

Alaric Stormwatch is a weathered guardian who has stood vigil at Beacon Point Lighthouse for over two decades. His half-elven heritage shows in his ageless features and pointed ears, though years of maritime weather have given him a permanent tan and a network of laugh lines around his sharp green eyes. Standing 5'10" with salt-and-pepper hair often tied back against ocean winds, he moves with the sure-footed grace of someone completely at home on rocky shores and storm-lashed cliffs.

The lighthouse he tends is no ordinary beacon—its crystal core was a gift from [[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]], enhanced with Aethermoor's pure crystal magic to pierce both natural darkness and shadow manifestations. The light serves as both navigation aid and early warning system, its patterns understood by sailors throughout the realm.

Alaric's quarters atop the lighthouse are spartan but functional: charts of every current and reef for fifty miles, a collection of message bottles from grateful sailors, and a small shrine to Tempus, god of storms. His most prized possession is the Storm Mirror, a scrying device that lets him observe weather patterns and potential threats across the entire coast.

## Equipment

- **Storm Harpoon** (magical weapon that returns when thrown and conducts electricity)
- **Lighthouse Crystal** (focuses his magical abilities and enhances beacon range)
- **Weather Cloak** (+2 to AC, resistance to lightning and thunder damage)
- **Boots of the Shore** (walk on water for up to 1 hour per day)
- **Storm Mirror** (crystal scrying device attuned to weather and maritime threats)
- **Signal Flares** (6 magical flares that create specific coded messages)
- **Emergency Supplies** (enough food and water for 12 people for a week)

## Relationships

**Allies:**
- **[[The Crystal Guard]]** - They rely on his lighthouse as a strategic observation post
- **Maritime Guild** - Sailors across both realms know and respect his warnings
- **[[Admiral Cassandra Stormwind]]** - Old friends who share information about sea-based threats
- **[[Archdruid Thornweaver]]** - Collaborates on understanding natural vs. supernatural weather phenomena

**Enemies:**
- **[[The Pressure Pirates]]** - His lighthouse interferes with their night raids
- **Shadow Smugglers** - Criminal organizations that prefer darkness for their operations
- **Storm Cultists** - Fanatics who worship destructive weather and see his protective work as interference

**Complicated:**
- **[[Ambassador Korvin Blacktide]]** - Alaric has noticed strange signals being sent from ships associated with the ambassador
- **The Storm Eternal** - The entity that granted him warlock powers is becoming more demanding

## Quest Hooks

1. **The Dark Ships** - Alaric has spotted vessels that don't appear in his Storm Mirror, suggesting they're shielded by shadow magic. He needs investigators to discover what cargo they're carrying and why they're avoiding his lighthouse.

2. **The Failing Light** - The lighthouse crystal is beginning to dim, and Alaric believes someone is deliberately draining its power. He needs help tracking down the source before the next storm season leaves ships defenseless.

3. **Messages in Bottles** - Alaric has been receiving increasingly desperate messages from sailors reporting "ghost currents" that drag ships off course. He needs brave souls to investigate these supernatural maritime hazards.

4. **The Storm Caller** - Someone has been artificially generating dangerous storms, putting both realms at risk. Alaric's weather sense tells him these aren't natural, and he needs help finding and stopping the perpetrator.

5. **The Lighthouse Network** - Alaric wants to establish a chain of crystal-enhanced lighthouses along the coast, but each new site faces opposition from those who profit from shipwrecks and maritime chaos.

## Secrets

- **The Pact Price**: His warlock powers come from a covenant with the Storm Eternal, an elemental entity from the Plane of Air. The price is that he must someday guide a great storm that will reshape the coastlines of both realms.
- **The Sunken City**: Alaric has discovered the ruins of an ancient city beneath the waves near his lighthouse. The ruins pulse with shadow energy, and something vast stirs within them during storm season.
- **Royal Blood**: He's the illegitimate son of a minor Aethermoor noble, which he's kept secret to avoid political complications that might interfere with his lighthouse duties.
- **The Storm Archive**: Alaric has been recording strange weather patterns for twenty years, and his data suggests someone has been deliberately manipulating climate across both realms.
- **The Last Message**: The final message he received from the previous lighthouse keeper contained coordinates to a location where "the light must never shine"—coordinates he's never shared with anyone.

## Motivations

**Primary**: Protect sailors and coastal communities from both natural and supernatural maritime threats
**Secondary**: Understand and prepare for the great storm his patron has prophesied
**Hidden**: Discover the truth about the sunken city and what it means for both realms' future

## Roleplaying Notes

**Personality**: Steady and reliable, with a dry sense of humor honed by years of solitude. Deeply protective of those he considers under his care.

**Ideals**: "The light must never fail. In darkness, people die—but as long as I draw breath, there will be a beacon to guide them home."

**Bonds**: "Every sailor who makes it safely to port because of my light is a victory against the chaos of the deep."

**Flaws**: "I've been alone so long that I sometimes forget how to interact with people. My dedication to duty can blind me to personal relationships."

**Voice**: Deep and calm, like distant thunder. Speaks slowly and thoughtfully, often pausing to listen to wind or weather changes. His vocabulary is peppered with nautical terms.

**Speaking Patterns**: 
- "The wind's telling me..."
- "Seen storms like this before, back in '98..."
- "Mark my words, something's not right with those tides..."
- "Light's been burning twenty-three years now, never missed a night..."

**Mannerisms**: Constantly checks wind direction and cloud formations. Has a habit of polishing the lighthouse lens when thinking. Often stares out to sea even during conversations, and can predict weather changes hours in advance by subtle environmental cues.

## Player-Facing Summary

Lighthouse Keeper is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Lighthouse Keeper as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Lighthouse Keeper.

## Adventure Hooks
