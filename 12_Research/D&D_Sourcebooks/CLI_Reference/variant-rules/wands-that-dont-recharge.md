# Wands That Don't Recharge
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 141* 

A typical wand has expendable charges. If you'd like wands to be a limited resource, you can make some of them incapable of regaining charges. Consider increasing the base number of charges in such a wand, to a maximum of 25 charges. These charges are never regained once they're expended.

## Player-Facing Summary

Wands that dont recharge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of wands that dont recharge as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around wands that dont recharge.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties wands that dont recharge to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at wands that dont recharge to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to wands that dont recharge active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
