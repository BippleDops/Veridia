### Lyme Walrus
![[4umg35qp.mrh.png|Lyme Walrus|300]]
[[4umg35qp.mrh.png|open outside]]

*Thick folds of fleshy blubber encase this massive sea creature. Yet despite its bestial appearance, its eyes reveal calculating intelligence, and it holds itself upright with unusual dignity. The illusion of a man would almost be convincing were it not for the long tusks that protrude from its whiskered mouth.*

## Special Traits
**Fascinating Story:** A Lyme walrus can manipulate its guttural voice while weaving a fascinating story. Creatures within 60 feet that can see and hear the Lyme walrus for 1 minute or longer must make successful DC 13 Charisma saving throws or be charmed and stunned for as long as the Lyme walrus continues speaking. Combat and other severe distractions prevent the ability from working. A creature that saves successfully is immune to Fascinating Story for 24 hours. Any potential threat allows a charmed creature to repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself with a success. Taking damage breaks the effect automatically on the injured creature. A creature need not understand Common for this ability to work; the power is in how the Lyme walrus modulates the sound of its voice, not in the words it speaks.

**Spell-like Abilities:** The Lyme walrus can use the following spell-like abilities, using Charisma as its casting ability (DC 13). The Lyme walrus needs only vocal components to use these abilities.

*At will:* minor illusion

*3/day each:* disguise self, major image

## Description
**Environment**: Coast

A child of Between that has lived so long in the mundane lands that it has literally shed its Between skin, a Lyme walrus is disturbingly human. The human aspects have been absorbed by mingling with men in its own lands. The walrus delights in the manners and appetites of men and feels itself to be at least partly human.

Named for Sister Lyme where these creatures were first encountered by the humanoid races of the mundane world, Lyme walruses can be found in other locales though they prefer to remain near a body of water to which they can retreat and move with the most freedom if necessary. The Lyme walrus often seeks out the company of people to learn tales and stories from them and to indulge in their appetites — particularly those of feasting. A Lyme walrus often wants only to hide itself in human lands, and eat. In this regard, it is generally harmless. However, they are possessed with a strong acquisitiveness and insatiable appetites, and often find themselves in the company of those who use their fascinating story ability as a distraction in order to perform darker acts undetected. The Lyme walrus is usually an innocent in this regard, and sees all such acts as simply the ways of the humanoids of the mundane world.

The Lyme walrus’s thick layer of blubber serves as protection from both predators and cold. A typical Lyme walrus weighs 1 to 2 tons and measures 10 feet in length with tusks up to 3 feet long.
