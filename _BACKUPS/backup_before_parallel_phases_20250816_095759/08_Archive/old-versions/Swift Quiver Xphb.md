*5th-level, Transmutation* - **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a Quiver worth 1+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute When you cast the spell and as a [[Action Xphb until it ends, you can make two attacks with a weapon that fires Arrows or Bolts, such as a Longbow or a Light Crossbow. The spell magically creates the ammunition needed for each attack. Each Arrow or Bolt created by the spell deals damage like a nonmagical piece of ammunition of its kind and disintegrates immediately after it hits or misses. **Classes**: [classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 329* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Swift quiver xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
