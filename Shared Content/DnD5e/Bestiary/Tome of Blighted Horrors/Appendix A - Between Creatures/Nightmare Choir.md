# Nightmare Choir
## Overview
### Nightmare Choir
![[c4nfftbz.lnu.png|Nightmare Choir|300]]
[[c4nfftbz.lnu.png|open outside]]

*A fleshy sack, discolored with veins, sits amid and beneath a trio of gangling legs that bend in all the wrong places. A head is thrust back that looks part bird, part cockroach; its beak more akin to a stinger. Its peacocklike plume is littered with wretched-looking scraps of flesh topped by a grisly collection of severed harpy heads, the eyes of which watch you with tortured expressions.*

## Special Traits
**Death Throes:** When it drops to 0 hit points, a nightmare choir explodes in a mass of thorny, fleshy limbs riddled with teeth and hundreds of tiny filaments that hook into clothing, skin, and flesh. Creatures within 20 feet of the nightmare choir take `dice: 6d6` piercing damage and are restrained; a successful DC Dex saving throw halves the damage and prevents being restrained. A restrained creature frees itself by using an action to make a successful DC 16 Str (Athletics) check. The area becomes difficult terrain for 10 minutes, and a creature that ends its turn in the difficult terrain takes `dice: 1d6` slashing damage.

**Magic Resistance (1/day):** When it fails a saving throw, the nightmare choir can choose to succeed instead.

**Swallow:** A creature that ends its turn grappled by the nightmare choir is swallowed whole. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained. It takes `dice: 3d8` necrotic damage automatically at the start of each of the nightmare choir’s turns. Only one Medium creature or two Small creatures can be inside the nightmare choir at one time. A swallowed creature is unaffected by anything happening outside the nightmare choir or by attacks from outside it. A swallowed creature can get out of the choir by using 5 feet of movement, but only after the monster is dead. When the nightmare choir inverts or reverts to normal, swallowed creatures are ejected prone into adjacent, empty spaces.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The nightmare choir makes one tongue attack and three claw attacks.

**Melee Attack—Claw:** +10 to hit (reach 10 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d8 + 5` slashing damage.

**Melee Attack—Tongue:** +10 to hit (reach 15 ft.; one creature). Hit: the target is grappled (escape DC 15) and pulled to within 5 feet of the nightmare choir, which then makes a bite attack against it as part of the same action.

**Melee Attack—Bite:** +10 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one grappled creature). Hit: `dice: 4d6 + 5` piercing damage plus `dice: 2d10` necrotic damage.

**Captivating Hymn (1/day):** The nightmare choir raises its harpy plumes, which begin singing. They continue singing as a bonus action for 1 minute. Creatures within 100 feet of the nightmare choir and able to hear it must make a successful DC 17 Wis saving throw or be charmed by the nightmare choir for as long as the singing continues. A charmed creature must move toward the nightmare choir along the most direct path, even if that takes them through dangerous terrain. A charmed creature that’s within 5 feet of the nightmare choir is stunned. A charmed creature repeats the saving throw when it takes damage, ending the effect on itself with a success. Success on the saving throw leaves a creature immune to Captivating Hymn for 24 hours.

**Area Attack—Horrific Inversion (recharge 6):** The nightmare choir inverts itself, becoming a huge maw filled with hundreds of quivering, needlelike teeth. The choir makes a bite attack against every creature within 5 feet of it, regardless of grappling. Creatures within 30 feet that witness this transformation must make a successful DC 17 Wis saving throw or be afflicted with madness. If the result of the saving throw is 12-16, the creature suffers a short-term madness; 7-11 results in long-term madness; 6 or less results in indefinite madness. An inverted nightmare choir cannot fly or use Captivating Hymn. It can revert to its normal form as a bonus action. When it inverts or reverts to normal, swallowed creatures are ejected prone into adjacent, empty spaces.

## Description
**Environment**: Any land (Between)

**Organization**: Solitary

A nightmare choir is an animalistic predator that uses the mesmerizing songs of harpies to lure prey to its side. When prey is near — and prey is anything that the nightmare choir can drain blood from — the monster suddenly inverts its body to make a surprising attack. In its usual form, it appears as a veiny sack of rubbery, feather-flecked skin, with bony, feathered wings, a swan’s neck tipped with a beaklike stinger, three skinny, multi-jointed legs tipped with talons, and long, peacocklike plumes tipped with the severed heads of harpies. When the monster inverts, it suddenly bloats into a balloon of flesh that rips apart to allow a great maw of hooked teeth to burst forward, and a long, sticky tongue to shoot out to draw its prey in. The collapsed flesh sack envelops its stinger, wings, and plume, which become unusable in this alternate form.

The thirteen eye-feathers of the nightmare choir’s plume are worth 100 gp each. If an eye-feather is used as an additional material component for a divination spell, the spell either takes effect as if cast with a spell slot 2 levels higher, or the saving throw against it is made with tactical disadvantage (caster’s choice).
