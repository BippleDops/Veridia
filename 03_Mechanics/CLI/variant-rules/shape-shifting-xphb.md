# Shape-Shifting
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 373. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

If an effect, such as Wild Shape or the [Polymorph](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/polymorph-xphb.md) spell, lets you shape-shift, its description specifies what happens to you. Unless that description says otherwise, any ongoing effects on you—[conditions](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/condition-xphb.md), spells, curses, and the like—carry over from one form to the other. You revert to your true form if you die.

## Player-Facing Summary

Shape shifting xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of shape shifting xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around shape shifting xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties shape shifting xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at shape shifting xphb to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to shape shifting xphb active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
