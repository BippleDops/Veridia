# Song of Compulsion (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour


## Effects
You start singing a well-known and mindless travelling song that has many verses. All living creatures within range that can hear and understand you must make a Wisdom saving throw or begin singing along. Neither you nor singing creatures are unable to take offensive actions, cast spells, or using any magic items (unless they would help with the song). A creature may make a new saving throw, at disadvantage, every minute, to end this effect.
