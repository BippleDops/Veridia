# The Leviathan Prophecy Campaign

> *"We thought we lived in an ocean. We were wrong. We live inside the rotting corpses of dead gods, and now they're starting to wake up."*
> — First verse of the Leviathan Prophecy

## Campaign Overview

Aquabyssos isn't an ocean—it's a vast necropolis of drowned gods whose corpses form the very geography of the underwater realm. The party discovers that civilization has been parasitically living inside divine cadavers for centuries. Now, impossibly, the dead gods are showing signs of consciousness. The Depth Mother isn't sleeping; she's gestating inside the collective corpse-ocean, ready to birth something unimaginable.

## The Horrific Truth

### Geographic Revelations
- **Mountain ranges**: Spinal columns of titanic deities
- **Trenches**: Wounds that never healed
- **Coral reefs**: Calcified divine blood
- **Ocean currents**: Circulation systems still pumping
- **Volcanic vents**: Digestive acids eating through reality
- **Continental plates**: Scales, skin, and shell fragments

### The Leviathan Ecology
Civilizations unknowingly built inside:
- **The Lung Cities**: Built in alveoli of a breathing god
- **Bone Marrow Colonies**: Mining divine calcium for construction
- **The Neuron Networks**: Cities along neural pathways, thoughts still firing
- **Cardiac Kingdoms**: Nations inside still-beating hearts
- **The Intestinal Highways**: Trade routes through digestive systems

## Campaign Phases

### Phase 1: Anatomical Discovery (Sessions 1-5)
**The Meat Map**

The party discovers an ancient map made of preserved flesh that reveals the truth—every major city is inside a corpse. Initial investigations into "geological" anomalies reveal biological origins.

**Key Discoveries**:
- Mountains bleed when mined too deep
- Earthquakes are actually muscle spasms
- Certain caves have teeth
- The tide follows a heartbeat rhythm

**Initial Locations**:
- **Port Intestinal**: A trade city inside a god's stomach
- **The Ventricle Valve**: Massive gates that open/close with divine heartbeat
- **Marrow Mines**: Where workers discover bones have memories

**Early Threats**:
- **Divine Parasites**: Creatures that feed on god-flesh
- **Antibody Storms**: Divine immune responses to civilization
- **Flesh Quakes**: Spasms as dead tissue reacts

### Phase 2: The Parasite Revelation (Sessions 6-10)
**Living Inside the Dead**

The party learns that all Aquabyssos life evolved from parasites and bacteria that inhabited the dying gods. Civilization is an infection that has gained sentience.

**The Parasite Priests**:
A religious order that embraces humanity's parasitic nature:
- Perform rituals to keep host bodies dead
- Sacrifice to appease divine antibodies
- Modify themselves with god-flesh grafts
- Believe ascending means becoming a better parasite

**Divine Archaeology Sites**:
- **The Neural Archive**: A dead god's brain where memories crystallize
- **The Heart Chamber**: A still-beating heart powering three cities
- **The Eye Socket**: A massive cave where visions of god-sight linger
- **The Tongue Valley**: Where divine words still echo with creation power

### Phase 3: Signs of Consciousness (Sessions 11-15)
**The Dead Dream**

The "dead" gods begin showing signs of awareness. Not alive, but not fully dead—existing in a state between, dreaming of their former existence.

**Awakening Symptoms**:
- **Memory Floods**: Divine memories overwhelm nearby mortals
- **Intentional Geography**: Landscape reshapes with purpose
- **The God-Whispers**: Dead vocal cords vibrate with messages
- **Synchronized Spasms**: All corpses convulse simultaneously

**The Prophecy Unfolds**:
*"When the dead gods dream as one,*
*When their hearts beat the same drum,*
*When their eyes open in the deep,*
*The Mother wakes from her sleep."*

**Major Events**:
- A dead god's hand reaches for something, crushing cities
- Divine tears flood entire regions with liquid sorrow
- Probability breaks down near awakening consciousness
- The party enters a god's dream directly

### Phase 4: The Depth Mother Rises (Sessions 16-20)
**The Birth of Horror**

The Depth Mother isn't a god—she's what grows from the collective corpse mulch of all dead gods. A new form of existence, gestating in divine decay.

**The Mother's Nature**:
- Consciousness made from all dead god thoughts
- Body forming from liquefied divine matter
- Power drawn from mortal worship of corpses
- Purpose: Transform reality into her image

**Apocalyptic Events**:
- **The Great Convergence**: All corpses merge into one mass
- **The Breath**: Dead gods exhale, creating toxic atmosphere
- **The Opening**: Eyes across the ocean floor open simultaneously
- **The Scream**: A sound that rewrites the laws of physics

### Phase 5: The Choice (Sessions 21-25)
**Parasite or Symbiote?**

The party must decide humanity's fate:
- **Fight the Awakening**: Keep the gods dead at terrible cost
- **Embrace Parasitism**: Evolve to better feed on divinity
- **Achieve Symbiosis**: Transform into beneficial organisms
- **Assist the Birth**: Help the Depth Mother emerge
- **The Escape**: Flee to Aethermoor before merger completes

## Unique Mechanics

### Biological Geography
- **Tissue Integrity**: Areas have health pools that affect stability
- **Infection Level**: Civilization's impact on divine corpses
- **Immune Response**: Rating 1-10 for divine antibody activity
- **Decomposition Stage**: How rotten the god-flesh is

### Divine Corruption
Extended exposure to god-flesh changes characters:
1. **Stage 1**: Minor benefits (heal faster, breathe underwater easier)
2. **Stage 2**: Physical changes (scales, gills, extra eyes)
3. **Stage 3**: Mental changes (think in divine languages)
4. **Stage 4**: Spiritual changes (perceive reality differently)
5. **Stage 5**: Become part of the god-corpse ecosystem

### Prophecy Points
Actions that fulfill prophecy grant meta-currency:
- Can be spent to alter dice rolls
- Unlock prophetic visions
- Gain divine spell-like abilities
- But each use makes the Depth Mother stronger

## Key NPCs

### Biomancer Corvus Intestinal
A scientist who discovered the truth and went mad. Now surgically modifies himself with god-parts, becoming less human with each "improvement." Offers upgrades to the party.

### The Leviathan Prophets
A cabal of seers who swim through god-blood to experience divine memories. Each prophecy costs them sanity, but reveals crucial truths about the awakening.

### Captain Marrow Drinker
A pirate who sails through god-veins in a ship made of crystallized divine blood. Knows secret passages through the corpse-geography.

### The First Parasite
The original life form that infected the dying gods. Now a collective consciousness spread throughout all divine corpses, offering guidance or corruption.

### Mother's Midwife
A being preparing for the Depth Mother's birth, setting up ritual sites and eliminating obstacles. May be ally or enemy depending on party choices.

## Notable Locations

### The God-Skull Archipelago
A chain of islands formed from a shattered divine skull. Each island contains different brain regions with unique properties:
- **Memory Island**: Past events physically manifest
- **Dream Island**: Reality follows dream logic
- **Logic Island**: Pure mathematical existence
- **Emotion Island**: Feelings become tangible forces

### The Spinal Highway
A trade route following a god's spinal column. Each vertebra is a city-state. Neural signals still fire, creating prophetic visions for travelers.

### The Digestive Sea
An ocean inside a god's stomach. Acid tides dissolve anything not protected. Civilizations live on floating platforms of crystallized antacid.

### The Heart Engine
A mechanical city built around a still-beating divine heart. The heartbeat powers everything, but it's speeding up, counting down to something.

## Horror Elements

### Body Horror
- NPCs gradually replaced by god-flesh dopplegangers
- Cities slowly digested by awakening systems
- People becoming living tumors on divine organs
- Children born with god-memories instead of personalities

### Existential Horror
- Humanity is just bacteria to divine bodies
- Free will is an illusion of parasitic evolution
- Love, art, culture—all just infection symptoms
- The gods died because of something worse

### Cosmic Horror
- The Depth Mother's true form cannot be comprehended
- Looking directly at awakening gods causes madness
- Reality itself is just divine decomposition
- The cycle has happened before and will happen again

## Campaign Endings

### The Stillbirth Ending
The Depth Mother is prevented from being born, but the cost is terrible—all divine corpses fully die, taking Aquabyssos with them.

### The Birth Ending
The Depth Mother emerges, transforming reality. The party must navigate the new world she creates from divine corpses.

### The Symbiosis Ending
Humanity evolves into beneficial organisms, healing the god-corpses in exchange for continued existence.

### The Exodus Ending
Mass evacuation to Aethermoor before the birth, leaving Aquabyssos to its fate.

### The Cycle Ending
The party discovers they must become the next generation of gods, dying to create the next ocean.

## DM Guidance

### Building Horror
- Start with subtle biological hints
- Gradually reveal the corpse truth
- Make players question their own biological nature
- Use visceral descriptions sparingly but effectively

### Managing Tone
- Balance cosmic horror with adventure
- Give players agency despite inevitable prophecy
- Use NPCs to show different coping methods
- Allow moments of beauty in the horror
