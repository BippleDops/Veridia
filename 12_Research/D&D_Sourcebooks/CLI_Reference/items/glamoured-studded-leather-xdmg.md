# Glamoured Studded Leather
*Light armor ([[studded-leather-armor-xphb|studded leather armor]]), rare*  

- **Armor Class**: 12 + Dex modifier
- **Weight**: 13.0 lbs.

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to [[armor-class-xphb|Armor Class]]. You can also take a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] to cause the armor to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of armor. You decide what it looks likeâ€”including color, style, and accessoriesâ€”but the armor retains its normal bulk and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or doff the armor.
