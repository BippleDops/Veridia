## Class Features

### Thief (Level 3)

*Hunt for Treasure as a Classic Adventurer*

A mix of burglar, treasure hunter, and explorer, you are the epitome of an adventurer. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you gain abilities useful for delving into ruins and getting maximum benefit from the magic items you find there.

### Fast Hands (Level 3)

As a [Bonus Action](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), you can do one of the following.

#### Sleight of Hand

Make a Dexterity ([Sleight of Hand](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Sleight%20of%20Hand)) check to pick a lock or disarm a trap with [Thieves' Tools](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/thieves-tools-xphb.md) or to pick a pocket.

#### Use an Object

Take the [Utilize](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Utilize) action, or take the [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to use a magic item that requires that action.

### Second-Story Work (Level 3)

You've trained to get into especially hard-to-reach places, granting you these benefits.

#### Climber

You gain a [Climb Speed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/climb-speed-xphb.md) equal to your [Speed](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md).

#### Jumper

You can determine your jump distance using your Dexterity rather than your Strength.

### Supreme Sneak (Level 9)

You gain the following Cunning Strike option.

#### Stealth Attack (Cost: 1d6)

If you have the [Hide](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Hide) action's [Invisible](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Invisible) condition, this attack doesn't end that condition on you if you end the turn behind [Three-Quarters Cover](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cover-xphb.md) or [Total Cover](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cover-xphb.md).

### Use Magic Device (Level 13)

You've learned how to maximize use of magic items, granting you the following benefits.

#### Attunement

You can attune to up to four magic items at once.

#### Charges

Whenever you use a magic item property that expends charges, roll `d6`. On a roll of 6, you use the property without expending the charges.

#### Scrolls

You can use any [Spell Scroll](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll-xdmg.md), using Intelligence as your spellcasting ability for the spell. If the spell is a cantrip or a level 1 spell, you can cast it reliably. If the scroll contains a higher-level spell, you must first succeed on an Intelligence ([Arcana](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Arcana)) check (DC 10 plus the spell's level). On a successful check, you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed check, the scroll disintegrates.

### Thief's Reflexes (Level 17)

You are adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal [Initiative](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) and your second turn at your [Initiative](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) minus 10.
