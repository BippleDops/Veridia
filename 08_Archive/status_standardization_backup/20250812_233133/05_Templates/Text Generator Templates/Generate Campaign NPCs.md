Create a detailed D&D NPC for the trade city of Shadowhaven. Include:

**Basic Details:**
- Name, race, age, gender
- Occupation and social standing
- Physical description and distinguishing features

**Personality & Motivation:**
- 3 personality traits
- Primary motivation and goals

- Relationship to at least 2 existing NPCs: [[Councillor Elara Brightwater]], [[Whisper Jack]], [[Master Thorne Blackforge]], [[Lady Seraphina Goldleaf]]
- A quest hook they could provide
- Something valuable they know or possess

**Background:**
- Where they live in the city (district)
- Daily routine and where players might encounter them
- Allies and enemies within the city

Setting Context: Shadowhaven is a major trade hub governed by competing guilds. Recent mysterious disappearances of merchant vessels have everyone on edge. Political tensions run high between the Merchants Guild, Crafters Union, Arcane Collective, and the shadowy Thieves Guild.

Format the response as if creating an Obsidian note with proper frontmatter tags.
```

## Prompt 2: Antagonist Generator

```
Create a compelling D&D antagonist NPC for Shadowhaven who could serve as either a recurring villain or a complex anti-hero. Include:

**Threat Level:**
- Challenge rating appropriate for levels 3-8
- Primary abilities and resources

**Complex Motivation:**
- Why they believe their actions are justified
- What traumatic event shaped their worldview
- A line they won't cross (moral boundary)
- Personal connection to the city or its people

**Political Position:**

- Resources and safe houses in the city

**Potential for Redemption:**
- What might convince them to change sides
- Relationship that could humanize them

This antagonist should feel like a real person with understandable (if misguided) goals, not a cartoon villain. They should create moral complexity for the party.

Setting: Shadowhaven is experiencing political upheaval due to missing merchant vessels and guild tensions.
```

## Prompt 3: Guild Leader Generator

```
Create a D&D NPC who leads one of Shadowhaven's major guilds. Choose from:

- Crafters Union (artisans and builders)

- Noble Assembly (aristocrats and landowners)

Include:

- Vision for Shadowhaven's future

The guild leader should feel powerful but not untouchable, with clear strengths and vulnerabilities that create interesting roleplay opportunities.
```

## Prompt 4: Street-Level Character Generator

```
Create a D&D NPC who represents Shadowhaven's common people - someone from the lower classes who still has interesting stories and useful connections. Include:

**Daily Life:**
- Specific job or means of survival
- Where they live and work in the city
- Daily routine and how players might encounter them
- Economic situation and financial pressures

**Unique Perspective:**
- What they know about the city that others don't
- Rumors they've heard or secrets they've witnessed
- How recent events (missing ships, guild tensions) affect them personally
- Survival skills and street wisdom

**Hidden Depths:**
- Surprising skill, talent, or knowledge they possess
- Connection to someone important or powerful
- Past that differs from their current situation
- Dream or ambition beyond their current circumstances

**Social Network:**
- Friends, family, and regular customers/contacts
- Who they trust and who they avoid
- Debts owed or favors they can call in
- Position in the neighborhood social hierarchy

**Story Hooks:**
- Problem they need help solving
- Information they'd trade for the right price
- Service they could provide to the party
- Way they could become a recurring contact

This NPC should feel real and grounded, someone who makes the city feel lived-in rather than just a backdrop for adventure. They might not be heroic, but they should be memorable and human.

Setting: Focus on how the current political tensions and mysterious disappearances affect ordinary people's lives.
```

## Prompt 5: Mysterious Figure Generator

```
Create an enigmatic D&D NPC for Shadowhaven who operates in shadows and deals in secrets. This character should inspire both curiosity and caution. Include:

- What happens to those who learn too much about them

**Information Network:**
- How they gather intelligence throughout the city
- Network of informants and contacts
- What kinds of secrets they collect and trade
- Protected information they'll never reveal

**Moral Ambiguity:**
- Actions that seem villainous but serve good purposes
- Help they provide that comes with hidden costs
- Lines they won't cross despite their shadowy nature
- Relationship with law enforcement and criminals

**Unique Abilities:**
- Special skills that make them valuable and dangerous
- Resources available despite operating in shadows
- Methods for staying hidden and protected
- Signature techniques or calling cards

**Connection Points:**
- How the party might first encounter them
- Services they might offer or request
- Information they possess about current mysteries
- Tests they might put the party through

**Long-term Potential:**
- How relationship with them might evolve
- Secrets they might eventually reveal
- Favors they might call in from the party
- Role they could play in larger conflicts

This character should be the type who shows up unexpectedly with exactly the right information or assistance, but always leaves the party wondering about their true motives.

Setting: Shadowhaven's current atmosphere of suspicion and intrigue makes this the perfect time for mysterious figures to emerge from the shadows.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Choose the appropriate prompt** based on what type of NPC you need
2. **Customize the setting details** if your campaign differs from the default Shadowhaven
3. **Add specific requirements** like particular skills, relationships, or plot connections
4. **Generate multiple options** and combine the best elements from different results
5. **Integrate with existing NPCs** by referencing established relationships and conflicts

## Post-Generation Steps

After generating an NPC:

1. **Create the note** using the Template-NPC-Ultra.md template
2. **Add relationships** to existing NPCs in their notes
3. **Update quest connections** if the NPC provides hooks
4. **Add to location notes** for where they can be encountered
5. **Consider visual elements** - AI-generated portrait, distinctive items, etc.

## Advanced Techniques

### Relationship Web Generation
Use multiple prompts to create interconnected NPCs:
1. Generate a primary NPC with the standard prompt
2. Create their ally using the same prompt but specifying the connection
3. Generate their enemy or rival with the antagonist prompt
4. Add a street-level character who knows rumors about all three

### Faction Building
Create entire guild hierarchies:
1. Use the guild leader prompt for the top position
2. Generate 2-3 lieutenants with specific roles
3. Add street-level characters who work for the guild
4. Create mysterious figures who infiltrate or oppose the guild

## Adventure Hooks

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
