# Life Transference
*3rd-level, Necromancy*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You sacrifice some of your health to mend another creature's injuries. You take `4d8` necrotic damage, which can't be reduced in any way, and one creature of your choice that you can see within range regains a number of hit points equal to twice the necrotic damage you take.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by `d8` for each slot level above 3rd.

**Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]
