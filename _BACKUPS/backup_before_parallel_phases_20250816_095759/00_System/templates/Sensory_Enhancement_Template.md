--- #### Integration Principles

1. **Layer sensations** - combine multiple senses in each description
2. **Vary intensity** - from subtle background to overwhelming foreground
3. **Match mood** - sensory details support narrative tone and emotional goals
4. **Cultural consistency** - maintain world-building logic and cultural patterns
5. **Character relevance** - tailor descriptions to character backgrounds and perspectives ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Sensory Enhancement Template is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Sensory Enhancement Template as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Sensory Enhancement Template. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Hidden Prophecy of Depths ## Plot Hooks - A shipment has gone missing and chaos spreads
