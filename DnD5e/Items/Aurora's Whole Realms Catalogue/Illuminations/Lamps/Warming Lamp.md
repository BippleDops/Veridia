## Description
Many a chilly bed or pair of frost-nipped hands has been rendered toasty by a warming lamp. This fist-sized iron sphere has tiny vents to allow air to reach the coals which provide its heat. Coals are inserted into the lamp through a small trapdoor held closed with a tiny pin or hook. Elves, gnomes, and other beings with infravision often make use of warming [[Lamps|lamps]] as small beacons. (8 sp)
