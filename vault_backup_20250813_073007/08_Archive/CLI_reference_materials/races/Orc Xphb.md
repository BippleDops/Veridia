### Adrenaline Rush

When you do so, you gain a number of [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/temporary-hit-points-xphb|Temporary Hit Points]] equal to your [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb|Proficiency Bonus]].

You can use this trait a number of times equal to your [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb|Proficiency Bonus]], and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb|Short]] or [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]].

### Relentless Endurance

When you are reduced to 0 [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Point]] instead. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]].

## Description

Orcs trace their creation to Gruumsh, a powerful god who roamed the wide open spaces of the Material Plane. Gruumsh equipped his children with gifts to help them wander great plains, vast caverns, and churning seas and to face the monsters that lurk there. Even when they turn their devotion to other gods, orcs retain Gruumsh's gifts: endurance, determination, and the ability to see in darkness.

Orcs are, on average, tall and broad. They have gray skin, ears that are sharply pointed, and prominent lower canines that resemble small tusks. Orc youths on some worlds are told about their ancestors' great travels and travails. Inspired by those tales, many of those orcs wonder when Gruumsh will call on them to match the heroic deeds of old and if they will prove worthy of his favor. Other orcs are happy to leave old tales in the past and find their own way.

## Player-Facing Summary

Orc xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of orc xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around orc xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties orc xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at orc xphb to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to orc xphb active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
