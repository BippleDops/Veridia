| 1 | I act based on instinct, rarely with a plan. |
| 2 | I am cowed by threats, and even preposterous ones make me pause. |
| 3 | Deep down, I know I am doomed to anonymity. |
| 4 | My natural inclination is to grovel and beg for the favor of those stronger than me. |
| 5 | I rage, but I use anger to distract from my fear of confrontation. |
| 6 | I become entangled and betrayed by my own machinations. |
