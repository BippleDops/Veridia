--- # Downtime Activity: Performing Sacred Rites

*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 129* A pious character can spend time between adventures performing sacred rites in a temple affiliated with a god he or she reveres. Between rites, the character spends time in meditation and prayer. A character who is a priest in the temple can lead these rites, which might include weddings, funerals, and ordinations. A layperson can offer sacrifices in a temple or assist a priest with a rite. A character who spends at least 10 days performing sacred rites gains "inspiration" (described in chapter 4 of the "Player's Handbook") at the start of each day for the next``dice: 2d6``days. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Downtime activity performing sacred rites is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
