## Special Traits
**Vorpal Bite:** The mandibles of a slicer beetle are extremely sharp. It scores a critical hit if the attack roll is a natural 19 or 20. If a slicer beetle scores a critical hit on its attack roll, the affected creature must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Failure indicates the slicer beetle severed one of the opponent's extremities (roll `dice: 1d8`: 1-4 = arm, 5-8 = leg; even = right, odd = left).

## Actions
**Bite:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 17 (`dice: 2d10+5`) piercing damage. If this attack scores a critical hit, see Vorpal Bite.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate forests

**Organization**: Solitary or cluster (2–5)

## Description
The slicer beetle closely resembles a large stag beetle and is often mistaken for one. However, the slicer beetle is more aggressive than the stag beetle. The creature dines on carrion, fresh meat, and leaves.

Slicer beetles are about 10 feet long, but they can grow to lengths of 20 feet or more.

The slicer beetle attacks by biting with its razor-sharp mandibles. Their lairs are often littered with the severed limbs of their victims.
