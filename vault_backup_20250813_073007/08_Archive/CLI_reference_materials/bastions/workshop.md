# Workshop
*Level 5 Bastion facility*  

- **Prerequisites**: None
- **Space**: Roomy (16 sq) or Vast (36 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 3 (Roomy) or 5 (Vast)
- **Order**: craft

This Workshop is a creative space where useful items can be crafted.

## Artisan's Tools

The Workshop comes equipped with six different kinds of Artisan's Tools, chosen from the following list:

- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/carpenters-tools-xphb|Carpenter's Tools]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/cobblers-tools-xphb|Cobbler's Tools]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/glassblowers-tools-xphb|Glassblower's Tools]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/jewelers-tools-xphb|Jeweler's Tools]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/leatherworkers-tools-xphb|Leatherworker's Tools]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/masons-tools-xphb|Mason's Tools]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/painters-supplies-xphb|Painter's Tools]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/potters-tools-xphb|Potter's Tools]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/tinkers-tools-xphb|Tinker's Tools]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/weavers-tools-xphb|Weaver's Tools]]  
- [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/woodcarvers-tools-xphb|Woodcarver's Tools]]  

## Craft Options

When you issue the "Craft" order to this facility, choose one of the following options:

- **Craft.** Adventuring Gear. The facility's hirelings craft anything that can be made with the tools you chose when you added the Workshop to your Bastion (see above), using the rules in the "Player's Handbook".  
- **Craft.** Magic Item (Implement). If you are level 9+, you can commission the facility's hirelings to craft a Common or an Uncommon magic item chosen by you from the "Implements" tables in "chapter 7". The facility has the tool required to craft the item, and the hirelings have proficiency with that tool as well as proficiency in the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Arcana|Arcana]] skill. See the ""Crafting Magic Items"" section in "chapter 7" for the time and money that must be spent to craft the item. If the item allows its user to cast any spells from it, you must craft the item yourself (the facility's hirelings can assist), and you must have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item.  

## Source of Inspiration

After spending an entire Short Rest in your Workshop, you gain [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/heroic-inspiration-xphb|Heroic Inspiration]]. You can't gain this benefit again until you finish a Long Rest.

## Enlarging the Facility

You can enlarge your Workshop to a Vast facility by spending 2,000 GP. If you do so, the Workshop gains two additional hirelings and three additional Artisan's Tools (chosen from the list above).

## Player-Facing Summary

Workshop is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of workshop as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around workshop.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties workshop to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at workshop to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to workshop active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
