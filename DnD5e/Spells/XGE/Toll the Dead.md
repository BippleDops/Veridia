# Toll the Dead
You point at one creature you can see within range, and the sound of a dolorous bell fills the air around it for a moment. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take `dice: 1d8|avg` (1d8) necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its hit points, it instead takes `dice: 1d12|avg` (1d12) necrotic damage.

The spell's damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (`dice: 2d8|avg` (2d8) or `dice: 2d12|avg` (2d12)), 11th level (`dice: 3d8|avg` (3d8) or `dice: 3d12|avg` (3d12)), and 17th level (`dice: 4d8|avg` (4d8) or `dice: 4d12|avg` (4d12)).
