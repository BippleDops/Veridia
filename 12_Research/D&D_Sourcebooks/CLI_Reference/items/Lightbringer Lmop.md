# Lightbringer
*Weapon ([[mace-xphb|mace]]), uncommon*  


- **Damage**: 1d6 bludgeoning
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This +1 mace was made for a cleric of Lathander, the god of dawn. The head of the mace is shaped like a sunburst and made of solid brass. Named Lightbringer, this weapon glows as bright as a [[torch-xphb|torch]] when its wielder commands. While glowing, the mace deals an extra `d6` radiant damage to undead creatures.
