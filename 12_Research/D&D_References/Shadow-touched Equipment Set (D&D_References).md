## Overview
The Shadow-touched Equipment Set represents gear that has been fundamentally transformed by prolonged exposure to [[The Deep Mother|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]]'s influence. Unlike simple cursed items, these pieces have been evolved by shadow magic into something that exists partially in darkness itself. Each piece offers significant power at the cost of gradually consuming the wielder's connection to light and hope. The set grows stronger as more pieces are worn together, but also accelerates the wielder's transformation into something no longer entirely human.

**Investigation**: Uncover whether hero's mission justifies risk of total corruption  
**Resolution**: Find alternative solution or guide hero's final heroic sacrifice

### The Shadow Market

**Discovery**: Market is front for [[The Deep Mother|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]] cult recruitment  
**Investigation**: Infiltrate organization and discover their ultimate purpose  
**Action**: Decide whether to expose, destroy, or co-opt the shadow market  
**Consequences**: Actions affect availability of shadow items throughout region

### The Last Light
**Level**: 15-20  
**Hook**: Multiple complete shadow sets have appeared, threatening to eclipse all light  
**Epic Scope**: Shadow-touched armies march to create permanent realm of darkness
