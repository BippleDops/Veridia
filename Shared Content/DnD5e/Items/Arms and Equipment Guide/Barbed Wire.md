# Barbed Wire
## Overview
**Barbed Wire:** This is a roll of barbed steel wire designed to keep things in or out. A creature trying to cross barbed wire must make a successful Reflex save (DC 10) or take `dice: 1d3` points of damage and be tripped. A pair of thick gloves is necessary to set up barbed wire. A handler who does not have gloves needs to succeed on a Dexterity check (DC 5) each round or take `dice: 1d2` points of damage. Building a barbed wire obstacle takes `dice: 1d4+6` hours, including anchor posts.

**Cost:** 75gp

**Weight:** 35lb.
