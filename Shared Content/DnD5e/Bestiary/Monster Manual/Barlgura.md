## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting.*** The barlgura's spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13). The barlgura can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
2/day each: *disguise self, invisibility (self only)*
1/day each: *entangle, phantasmal force*

***Reckless.*** At the start of its turn, the barlgura can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls it makes during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.

***Running Leap.*** The barlgura's long jump is up to 40 feet and its high jump is up to 20 feet when it has a running start.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The barlgura makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its fists.

***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (`dice: 2d6+4`) piercing damage.

***Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (`dice: 1d10+4`) bludgeoning damage.

***Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day).*** The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.

A barlgura has a 30% summoning chance chance of summoning one barlgura.

A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

## Description
The barlgura represents the savagery and brutality of the Abyss. Barlguras gather in packs to take down tougher foes, keep gruesome trophies from their victories, and decorate their territory with such objects.

A barlgura looks like a hulking orangutan with a gruesome, drooping visage and tusks jutting from its jaw. Standing just under 8 feet tall, it has broad shoulders and weighs 650 pounds. It moves apishly along the ground, but it climbs with great speed and agility.
