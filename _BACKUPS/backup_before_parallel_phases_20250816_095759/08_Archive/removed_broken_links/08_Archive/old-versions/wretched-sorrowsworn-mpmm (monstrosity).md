*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 224, Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 233* Horrid little monsters, wretched sorrowswornâ€”or the Wretchedâ€”gather in packs to scour the Shadowfell for prey. These desperate entities subsist on life force; when they find a creature, they surge forward to sink their fangs into their victims and drink deep. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Sorrowsworn The Shadowfell's pervasive melancholy sometimes gives rise to strange incarnations of the plane's bleak nature.
