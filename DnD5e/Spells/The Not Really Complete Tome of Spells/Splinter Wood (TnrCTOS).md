# Splinter Wood (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You cause a wooden object, including trees, of Medium-size or smaller to violently explode. All creatures within 30 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 piercing damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much on a successful one. If the wooden object is held by a creature (such as a spear or quarterstaff), the creature who is holding it may not attempt to make a sav-ing throw to avoid damage, but must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for 1 minute due to flying splinters (if the creature is wearing something over its eyes, such as a full-face helmet, it is immune).
