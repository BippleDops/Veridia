## Description
You can use an action to speak the horn’s [[Command|command]] word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot [[2 - Casting a Spell|cone]] that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the [[2 - Casting a Spell|cone]] must make a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15 [[Constitution|Constitution]] saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice: 5d6`(5d6) [[17 - Damage and Healing|thunder]] damage and is [[Deafened|deafened]] for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t [[Deafened|deafened]]. Creatures and [[11 - Objects|objects]] made of glass or crystal have [[2 - Advantage and Disadvantage|disadvantage]] on the saving throw and take `dice: 10d6` (10d6) [[17 - Damage and Healing|thunder]] damage instead of  `dice: 5d6`(5d6).

Each use of the horn’s magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals `dice: 10d6` (10d6) [[17 - Damage and Healing|fire]] damage to the blower and destroys the horn.
