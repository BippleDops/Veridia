# The Reflection Pools

*Where time flows in circles and truth drowns in possibility*

## Overview

The Reflection Pools are a series of perfectly still underwater basins located in the Twilight Depths, where the boundary between memory and prophecy dissolves. These ancient pools don't reflect the physical world but instead show what was, what is, and what might be—often simultaneously. Created by the first Mer-Folk seers as windows into time itself, the pools have become both a pilgrimage site for those seeking truth and a dangerous trap for those unable to distinguish reality from reflection.

The pools exist in a state of temporal flux, where past events replay alongside future possibilities. Visitors report seeing themselves as children playing next to their own graves, or witnessing conversations that won't happen for decades. The Parliament of Echoes maintains a small garrison here, not to protect the pools but to prevent people from becoming lost in their own reflections—a fate that has claimed hundreds over the centuries.

## Physical Description

### Architecture & Layout
Seven pools arranged in a perfect spiral pattern, each deeper than the last, connected by channels that flow in impossible directions—upward, inward, and through dimensions. The pools are carved from a single piece of temporal crystal that exists in multiple time periods simultaneously.

### Environmental Features
- **Climate**: Perpetually twilight, neither day nor night
- **Terrain**: Smooth crystal surfaces that show different scenes from different angles
- **Hazards**: Temporal loops, identity confusion, possibility paralysis
- **Resources**: Temporal water (dangerous to drink), prophecy pearls, memory shards

## For the Table

### First Impressions (Read Aloud)
> *The water here is so still it seems solid, yet within its depths, images flow like liquid dreams. You see yourself approaching—but from different angles, at different ages, making different choices. In one reflection, you turn back. In another, you dive deep. In a third, you never existed at all. The silence is absolute, yet you hear whispers of conversations you've had, will have, might never have. Each pool shows a different version of now, and you're no longer certain which one you're actually experiencing.*

### Quick Hooks
1. **Immediate**: A PC sees their own death in a pool
2. **Investigation**: Someone is stealing reflections from the pools
3. **Social**: A future version of an NPC asks for help
4. **Combat**: Past and future versions of enemies attack
5. **Discovery**: The pools reveal the location of a crucial item

### Fail-Forward Scenarios
- **If PCs ignore this location**: They miss crucial warnings about future threats
- **If PCs fail here**: They gain knowledge but lose memories in exchange
- **If PCs succeed spectacularly**: They can actively change one future event

### Scaling by Level
- **Levels 1-5**: See vague possibilities, minor temporal disorientation
- **Levels 6-10**: Clear visions, risk of temporal displacement
- **Levels 11-15**: Interact with other timelines, major paradox risks
- **Levels 16-20**: Actively reshape causality through the pools
