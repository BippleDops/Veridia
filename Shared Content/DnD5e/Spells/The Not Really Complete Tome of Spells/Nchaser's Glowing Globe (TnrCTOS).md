# Nchaser's Glowing Globe (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a globe of high-quality colored glass)

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
You fill the globe with a flickering light, much like the one created by *continual flame*. However, you can control the intensity of the light, making it as bright as a torch to some-what dimmer than the light produced by the *faerie fire* spell. You may control the light from as far as 20 feet away.
