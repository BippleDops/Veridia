# Piwafwi (Cloak of Elvenkind)
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/piwafwi-cloak-of-elvenkind.webp#right)

This dark spider silk cloak is made by [[Bestiary]]. It is a [[Cloak of Elvenkind Xdmg]]. It loses its magic if exposed to sunlight for 1 hour without interruption.

While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) checks made to see you have disadvantage. and you have advantage on Dexterity ([[skills#Stealth|Stealth]]) checks made to hide, as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
