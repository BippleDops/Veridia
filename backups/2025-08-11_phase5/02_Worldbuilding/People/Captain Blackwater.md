# Captain Blackwater
*The Lost Brother, Herald of Crystal Song*

## Overview
Captain Marcus "Black Mark" Blackwater is the younger brother of the famous explorer [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Captain Thaddeus Blackwater]]. Once a respected naval officer in his own right, Marcus became obsessed with finding his missing brother and launched his own expedition into [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Crystalline Wastes]]. What he found there changed him forever. Now partially transformed by crystal corruption, he serves as an unwitting herald for the awakening power of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/Quest - The Seventh Shard]], leading a crew of similarly corrupted souls through the dangerous borderlands between the crystal wastes and the civilized world.

## Appearance
- **Age**: 42 (appears older due to corruption)
- **Build**: Tall like his brother, but now gaunt and angular
- **Skin**: Pale with veins of blue-green crystal visible beneath the surface
- **Hair**: Originally brown, now shot through with crystal formations that chime softly in the wind
- **Eyes**: Once sea-blue like Thaddeus, now glowing with inner crystal light
- **Clothing**: Modified naval uniform, reinforced with crystal plating that has grown into his flesh
- **Distinguishing marks**: Left arm is partially crystallized, crystal growths along his jaw, speaks with two voices (his own and the crystal's whispers)
- **Equipment**: Crystalline cutlass that hums with power, corrupted compass that points toward crystal concentrations

## Personality
- **Traits**: Torn between his original noble nature and crystal-induced compulsions, speaks to invisible crystal entities
- **Ideals**: Family loyalty corrupted into obsessive need to "save" others through crystal transformation
- **Bonds**: Desperate to find and "help" his brother Thaddeus, protective of his corrupted crew
- **Flaws**: Increasingly unable to distinguish between salvation and corruption, hears crystal "songs" that drive his actions

## Background

- Distinguished naval career, though never achieving Thaddeus's fame
- Married with two children (currently under [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]'s protection)
- When Thaddeus disappeared, launched unauthorized rescue mission
- Found evidence of his brother's expedition but was caught in crystal storm

- Mapping the expansion of crystal corruption zones
- Protecting corrupted settlements from "purification" raids
- Seeking artifacts that might complete his transformation or cure it

### Territory & Influence
- **The Singing Straits**: Area where crystal formations extend into the water
- **Port Resonance**: A corrupted settlement he helps protect
- **The Crystal Gardens**: Floating islands of pure crystal where his ship refuels
- **The Harmonic Depths**: Underwater crystal formations he can navigate

### Hidden Goals
> [!warning] DM Secret
> Marcus isn't fully aware that he's being used as a herald by the Seventh Shard. His "rescue missions" are actually recruitment drives, and his growing network of corrupted individuals is being positioned for something much larger. The Shard whispers convince him he's saving people, but he's actually preparing them for a mass awakening event.

## Quest Hooks

### The Brother's Burden
**Level**: 9-13  
The party encounters Marcus during one of his "rescue" operations. They must decide whether to help him search for Thaddeus, try to cure his corruption, or stop him from corrupting others. The truth about both brothers' fates lies somewhere in the deepest parts of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Crystalline Wastes]].

### The Crystal Refugees
**Level**: 7-11  
A group of partially corrupted people seek the party's help in escaping Marcus's protection. They're torn between fear of their growing transformation and loyalty to the man who saved them from worse fates. The party must navigate the moral complexity of crystal corruption.

### The Singing Ship
**Level**: 10-14  
Marcus's ship has been spotted near major shipping lanes, and its crystal song is affecting passing vessels. The party is hired to investigate, but they discover Marcus is trying to warn ships away from a much greater danger emerging from the crystal depths.

### The Family Reunion
**Level**: 12-16  
Word reaches Marcus that his children are asking about their father. Against all advice, he begins moving toward [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Lumengarde]] to see them. The party must either help facilitate a safe meeting or prevent a tragedy when the crystal corruption meets royal security.

### The Seventh Song
**Level**: 15-18  
Marcus has discovered the location of the Seventh Shard and believes he can use it to cure crystal corruption. In reality, the Shard plans to use him as a conduit for a massive transformation event. The party must stop him while he's convinced he's saving the world.

## Secrets & Hidden Knowledge

### What He Knows
- The location of Thaddeus's final three campsites
- How to navigate crystal storms safely
- The true extent of crystal corruption spread
- Identities of other high-ranking corrupted individuals
- The existence of a crystal "song" that connects all corrupted beings

### What He Suspects But Won't Admit
- His rescue missions might be making corruption worse
- The voice in his head isn't entirely his own
- His family might be safer without him
- Thaddeus might have found something that changed everything
- The corruption has a purpose beyond random spread

### What He Doesn't Know
- The Seventh Shard is using him as a herald
- His wife has remarried and his children barely remember him
- [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]] orchestrated both brothers' expeditions
- There is a cure for crystal corruption, but it requires sacrifice
- His father is funding expeditions to "put him out of his misery"

## Roleplaying Notes

### Speech Patterns
*"The crystals sing of truth, brother. Can you hear their harmony?"*

*"Thaddeus would understand. He always saw the deeper currents."*

*"Corruption? No, friend - this is evolution. This is becoming more than we were."*

### Mannerisms
- Frequently touches the crystal formations on his face when thinking
- Speaks to the crystals as if they're crew members
- Uses naval terminology even when discussing crystal magic
- Becomes agitated when anyone suggests his brother is dead
- Hums melodies that seem to make crystals resonate

### The Two Voices
Marcus sometimes speaks in two voices - his own and the whisper of the Seventh Shard. Players can make Insight checks (DC 15) to notice when the Shard is influencing his words.

- **Marcus's Voice**: Warm, concerned, desperate to help others
- **Shard's Influence**: Cold, calculating, focused on "perfect unity"

## Potential Character Arc

### Redemption Path
If the party helps Marcus confront the truth about his corruption and finds a way to separate him from the Shard's influence, he could become a valuable ally in stopping the crystal apocalypse. This requires:
1. Reuniting him safely with his family
2. Finding definitive proof of Thaddeus's fate
3. Breaking his connection to the Seventh Shard
4. Helping him accept responsibility for those he's corrupted

### Tragic Path
If Marcus continues down his current path, he becomes the unwitting catalyst for a massive crystal transformation event, potentially corrupting entire cities while believing he's saving them.
