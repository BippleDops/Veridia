## Description
A common sight across Toril, our snuffing bells are large enough to douse even the largest altar [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Household Accoutrements/Candles|candles]]. The tip also holds an oiled wick for lighting [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Household Accoutrements/Candles|candles]], and the small blade positioned between the wick and bell arms even the youngest acolyte to defend the faith. (6 gp)
