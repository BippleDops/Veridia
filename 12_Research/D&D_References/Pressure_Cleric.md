# Pressure Cleric - Character Build

## Overview
The Pressure Cleric represents a unique divine tradition that venerates the crushing depths of [[Aquabyssos]] as a sacred force. These clerics serve deities of the deep ocean, channeling the inexorable power of water pressure to heal, harm, and maintain the cosmic balance between surface and depth. They are both healers who help communities adapt to crushing environments and warriors who wield pressure as a weapon.

## Core Concept
Pressure Clerics worship deities associated with ocean depths, water pressure, and the transformation that occurs under extreme conditions. They believe that pressure reveals truth by stripping away superficial illusions, that depths hold sacred mysteries, and that the crushing force of the ocean is a purifying divine power. Many serve as deep-sea chaplains, pressure adaptation specialists, or guardians of abyssal temples.
