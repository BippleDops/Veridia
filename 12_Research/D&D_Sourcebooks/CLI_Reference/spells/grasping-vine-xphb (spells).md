--- # Grasping Vine

*4th-level, Conjuration* - **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute You conjure a vine that sprouts from a surface in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The vine lasts for the duration. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within 30 feet of the vine. On a hit, the target takes`4d8`Bludgeoning damage and is pulled up to 30 feet toward the vine; if the target is Huge or smaller, it has the [[conditions#Grappled|Grappled]] condition (escape DC equal to your spell save DC). The vine can grapple only one creature at a time, and you can cause the vine to release a [[conditions#Grappled|Grappled]] creature (no action required). As a [[Action Xphb]] on your later turns, you can repeat the attack against a creature within 30 feet of the vine. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The number of creatures the vine can grapple increases by one for each spell slot level above 4. **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 280* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Grasping vine xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.

Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
