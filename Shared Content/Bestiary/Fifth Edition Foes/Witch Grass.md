## Special Traits
**Defenseless:** Witch grass plants automatically fail saving throws.

**Magic Damping:** When an arcane spellcaster tries to cast an arcane spell within 20 feet of a patch of witch grass, the caster must make an Int or Cha saving throw; use the ability most appropriate to the spellcasters class. The DC equals 10 + the size of the patch in 10 ft. squares (see Organization, above). For example, if a wizard tries to cast a spell near a 30-square-foot patch of witch grass, she must make a successful DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. If the save succeeds, the spell is cast normally. If the saving throw fails, the spell is not cast but the spell slot is not expended. Only arcane magic is affected.

**Seeds:** Witch grass seeds attach themselves to anything they come in contact with. Seeds have the same magic damping effect as the plants, but their range is only 10 feet and the DC to overcome their effect is always 11. The effect lasts for 12 hours, then the seeds lose their potency. A close inspection of clothing and gear, plus a successful DC 8 Intelligence (Nature) check, reveals the presence of the seeds. Once theyre identified, seeds can be eliminated by spending an hour washing and thoroughly cleaning clothes, animals, and equipment.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate or warm forests, hills, and plains

**Organization**: Patch (`dice: 1d6` x 10 sq. ft.)

## Description
Witch grass is a summer-blooming, broad leaved plant that stands 2 feet tall at maturity. Its leaves and branches are very bushy, with a purplish h u e that extends to the plant’s base and roots. A patch of witch grass covers an area of 10 to 60 square feet. It is only found in temperate or warm forests, hills and plains.

Witch grass is completely harmless in most ways, but it has an inhibiting effect on arcane magic. Something about the plant causes the intricate memorization patterns in an arcane spellcaster’s mind to become muddled, making it difficult for them to cast spells properly. Only arcane magic is hampered; divine spellcasters aren’t bothered by the plants.

When anything brushes past a witch grass plant, the plant’s tiny seeds attach themselves to clothing, fur, boots, saddles, hooves, and whatever else they come in contact with. Once they get into a spellcaster’s clothing or gear, or that of his or her companions, they can cause almost as much trouble as an entire patch of witch grass. The seeds are easily eliminated by cleaning, but the job must be thorough.
