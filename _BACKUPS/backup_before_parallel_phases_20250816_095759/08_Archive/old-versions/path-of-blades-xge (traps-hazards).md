--- # Path of Blades

*Generic Hazard* Hidden within a buried pyramid that marks the location of the Lost City of Cynidicea is the tomb of King Alexander and Queen Zenobia. The entrance to their tomb is a long hallway riddled with traps, accessible only by cunningly hidden secret doors. The hallway is 20 feet wide and 160 feet long. It is mostly clear. After 80 feet, the floor is broken and cracked, becoming difficult terrain until the 130-foot mark. *Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 118* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Path of blades xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
