# Toll the Dead
*cantrip, Necromancy*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You point at one creature you can see within range, and the single chime of a dolorous bell is audible within 10 feet of the target. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take `d8` Necrotic damage. If the target is missing any of its [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]], it instead takes `d12` Necrotic damage.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by one die when you reach levels 5 (`2d8` or `2d12`), 11 (`3d8` or `3d12`), and 17 (`4d8` or `4d12`).
