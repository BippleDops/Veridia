## Overview

The Reputation System tracks characters' standing with various factions, organizations, settlements, and influential individuals across both [[Aquabyssos]] and [[Aethermoor]]. Unlike simple approval ratings, this system recognizes that reputation is multifacetedâ€”you might be feared by enemies, respected by allies, and unknown to neutral parties, all simultaneously.

Reputation affects everything from prices in shops to access to restricted areas, availability of services, quest opportunities, and survival during political crises. In the merged realms, reputation with one faction can dramatically affect standing with their allies or enemies, creating complex webs of social consequence.

The system operates on multiple scales: personal reputation with individuals, local reputation within communities, organizational reputation with factions, and realm-wide reputation affecting major political movements. Each scale influences the others but can be managed separately through targeted actions and relationship building.

Recent convergence events have complicated reputation management as factions from both realms now interact regularly, creating opportunities for diplomatic bridges or catastrophic misunderstandings. Characters may find their reputation in one realm helps or hinders them in the other, depending on political alliances and cultural differences.

### Reputation Scales

Reputation is measured on a scale from -100 to +100, with different descriptive terms for each range:

**Reputation Scale**:
- **+81 to +100**: **Legendary** - Revered, worshipped, or legendary status
- **+61 to +80**: **Exalted** - Highly honored, trusted completely
- **+41 to +60**: **Revered** - Greatly respected, significant influence
- **+21 to +40**: **Honored** - Well-regarded, doors open easily
- **+11 to +20**: **Friendly** - Liked and trusted, minor benefits
- **+1 to +10**: **Neutral+** - Slightly positive, no special treatment
- **0**: **Neutral** - Unknown or no strong opinion
- **-1 to -10**: **Neutral-** - Slight negativity, minor suspicion
- **-11 to -20**: **Unfriendly** - Disliked, treated with caution
- **-21 to -40**: **Hostile** - Actively opposed, doors close
- **-41 to -60**: **Hated** - Despised, significant obstacles
- **-61 to -80**: **Reviled** - Actively hunted or attacked
- **-81 to -100**: **Nemesis** - Sworn enemies, kill-on-sight

### Reputation Categories

Each faction or organization tracks multiple aspects of reputation:

**Primary Categories**:
- **Trust**: Reliability and honesty in dealings
