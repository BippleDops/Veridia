# Awaken
After spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a precious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The target must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of 3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also gains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a plant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines, creepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human's. Your DM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such as the statistics for the [[awakened shrub]] or the [[awakened tree]].

The awakened beast or plant is [[charmed]] by you for 30 days or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the [[charmed]] condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to remain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was [[charmed]].
