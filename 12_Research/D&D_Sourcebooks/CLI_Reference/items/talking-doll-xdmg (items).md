--- # Talking Doll

*Wondrous item, common (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/talking-doll.webp#right) While this doll is within 5 feet of you, you can spend a [[short-rest-xphb]] telling it to say up to six phrases, none of which can be more than six words long, and set a condition under which the doll speaks each phrase. You can also replace old phrases with new ones. Whatever the condition, it must occur within 5 feet of the doll to make it speak. For example, whenever someone picks up the doll, it might say, "I want a piece of candy." The doll's phrases are lost when your [[attunement-xphb (variant-rules)]] to the doll ends. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 315* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Talking doll xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
