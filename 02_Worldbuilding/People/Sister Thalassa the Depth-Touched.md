# Sister Thalassa the Depth-Touched
*High Priestess of the Drowned Prophets, Voice of the Mother's Dreams*

## Overview
Sister Thalassa is the most devoted servant of [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Mother]], having spent thirty years in the deepest trenches communing with her sleeping goddess. The pressure and proximity to divine dreams have transformed her both physically and mentallyâ€”she can survive at impossible depths, speaks with the Deep Mother's voice in her dreams, and leads the most radical sect of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Drowned Prophets]] in preparing for the Great Awakening.

## Description
- **Appearance**: Pale, elongated figure with pressure-adapted features and glowing eyes
- **Modifications**: Gills along her neck, webbed fingers, skin that glows faintly in darkness
- **Voice**: Speaks in whispers that carry impossible distances underwater
- **Presence**: Fish and deep-sea creatures gather around her, sensing her connection to their primal source
- **Bearing**: Moves with fluid grace, seems to flow rather than walk

## Background
### The Calling
- Born in [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Abyssos Prime]] to merchant family
- Experienced prophetic dreams of the Deep Mother from childhood
- At age 20, voluntarily descended to the Hadal Depths for "pilgrimage"
- Survived impossible pressure through divine intervention
- Returned three months later, transformed and speaking prophecies

### The Deep Communion
- Spends months each year in the deepest trenches, communing with the Deep Mother
- Claims to hear the goddess's heartbeat and dream-whispers directly
- Records the Mother's visions in the sacred text "Songs from the Sleeping Deep"
- Gradually becoming more divine than mortal through repeated exposure

## Depth-Touched Abilities

- **Deep Sight**: Sees clearly in absolute darkness of the depths
- **Dream Speaker**: Receives visions and messages from the Deep Mother
- **Pressure Command**: Can alter pressure around her to crush or protect
- **Depth Swimming**: Moves through water faster than most sea creatures

### Prophetic Powers

- **Shadow Sight**: Can see through shadow creatures' eyes across Aquabyssos
- **Memory Currents**: Taps into collective unconscious of drowning victims
- **Depth Madness**: Can drive others insane with visions of the depths
- **Divine Protection**: The Deep Mother shields her from harm
