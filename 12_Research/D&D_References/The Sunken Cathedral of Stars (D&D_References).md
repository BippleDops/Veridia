The Sunken Cathedral of Stars serves as the primary headquarters for [[The Leviathan Cult|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/The Leviathan Cult]], a massive underwater structure where [[High Priest Dagon Deepcaller|02 Worldbuilding/People/High Priest Dagon Deepcaller]] conducts transformation rituals and coordinates the cult's campaign to return the world to the sea. ## Player-Facing Summary The Sunken Cathedral of Stars is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Sunken Cathedral of Stars as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around The Sunken Cathedral of Stars. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology.
