## Overview
A critical environmental quest where players must recover the last surviving seeds of the Great Kelp Forests that once thrived around Aquabyssos. These magical plants provided oxygen, food, and natural protection for the city, but disease and corruption have nearly driven them to extinction.

Time is running out as the city's air recycling systems begin to fail without the natural kelp forests to supplement them.

## Quest Background
Decades ago, vast kelp forests surrounded Aquabyssos, forming natural barriers and life support systems. A mysterious blight began destroying these forests five years ago, and despite all efforts, they continue to die. The last hope lies in ancient seed vaults scattered throughout the ocean depths.

## The Three Vaults
**The Sunken Vault**: Located in ancient ruins, guarded by corrupted sea life
**The Deep Vault**: In crushing ocean depths, protected by pressure-adapted guardians
**The Hidden Vault**: Concealed within enemy territory, watched by hostile forces

## Key NPCs
**Botanist Sage Kellin**: Expert on kelp cultivation and quest giver
**Vault Guardian Tidal**: Ancient construct protecting the Sunken Vault
**Deep Hermit Crush**: Knows the location of the Deep Vault but demands payment
**Enemy Agent**: Saboteur working to prevent the quest's success

## Environmental Urgency
**Current Status**: City has 3-6 months of air reserves remaining
**Degradation Rate**: Environmental conditions worsen each month
**Consequences**: Without action, mass evacuation or worse becomes necessary
**Public Knowledge**: Citizens growing increasingly worried and desperate

## Challenges and Obstacles
**Environmental**: Toxic water, crushing pressure, limited visibility
**Biological**: Corrupted creatures, hostile guardians, dangerous predators
**Political**: Faction interference, resource competition, sabotage
**Technical**: Complex preservation requirements, delicate cultivation process
**Time Pressure**: Environmental degradation creates escalating urgency

## Quest Variations
**Investigation Focus**: Discover and eliminate the blight source
**Political Drama**: Navigate faction politics while securing seeds
**Survival Challenge**: Emphasize environmental dangers and resource management
**Race Against Time**: Multiple competing groups seeking the same seeds

## Adventure Hooks
1. Environmental disaster threatens character's home
2. Characters hired by concerned citizens or officials
3. Discovery of vault location creates opportunity
4. Previous expedition failed, characters asked to investigate

## Long-term Impact
Success in this quest can fundamentally change the campaign setting, restoring natural ecosystems and potentially revealing larger environmental or political conspiracies. The restored forests become ongoing elements of the world.

### Key Locations
1. Main entrance/approach
2. Central gathering area
3. Important buildings/features
4. Defensive positions (if applicable)
5. Hidden or secret areas

## DM Notes
This quest combines environmental urgency with political intrigue and dungeon exploration. The time pressure creates natural tension while the large-scale consequences give weight to player actions. Consider how success or failure affects the broader campaign world.
