## Description
The hooded lantern is the basic lantern which all other [[Lanterns|lanterns]] are variations on. A sturdy classic design, the [[Lanterns|lanterns]] I stock feature a rust-resistant [[Metal|metal]] [[Reservoir|reservoir]] for the oil and a [[Metal|metal]] cap. Between the two is a [[Metal|metal]] assembly with disks of thick glass inset in it that allows light to escape. The [[Metal|metal]] cap limits heat radiated to the top of the lantern, allowing it to be carried by a handle which curves over its top. (7 gp)

## Additional Details
This lantern projects light 30 feet in all directions (360 degrees) and burns six hours per pint [[Canteen|flask]] of oil supplied. Holds one pint of oil.
