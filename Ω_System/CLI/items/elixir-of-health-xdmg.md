# Elixir of Health
*Potion, rare*  


- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, you are cured of all magical contagions. In addition, the following conditions end on you: [Blinded](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Blinded), [Deafened](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Deafened), [Paralyzed](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Paralyzed), and [Poisoned](/3-Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Poisoned).

The clear, red liquid has tiny bubbles of light in it.
