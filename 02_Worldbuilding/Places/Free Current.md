## Overview

Free Current represents the largest and most important transportation network in [[Aquabyssos]], a vast system of interconnected underwater currents that serves as both highway and community for the realm's inhabitants. Unlike the controlled and monitored transportation systems of major cities, Free Current operates on principles of mutual aid, collective goverce, and open access to all who respect its customs and contribute to its maintece.

More than just a series of water flows, Free Current has evolved into a unique society unto itself - a mobile civilization of traders, travelers, refugees, adventurers, and free spirits who have chosen the nomadic life of the eternal journey over the settled existence of the great cities. The Current flows through nearly every major region of [[Aquabyssos]], connecting disparate communities and serving as a vital conduit for commerce, communication, and cultural exchange.

The name "Free Current" reflects both its political independence from any major power and its foundational principle that movement through the depths should be available to all, regardless of social status, political affiliation, or economic means. This philosophy has created a remarkable experiment in underwater democracy and communal living that continues to thrive after four centuries of operation.
