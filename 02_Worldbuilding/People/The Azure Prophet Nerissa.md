# The Azure Prophet Nerissa
*Speaker for the Sunken Shard, Voice of the Depths*

## Overview
The Azure Prophet Nerissa is believed to be the only living mortal who has direct communion with the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards|Azure Shard]], which lies buried in a sunken temple beneath [[The Azure Coast]]. Through dreams and visions, the Shard shows her glimpses of possible futuresâ€”all of them involving rising seas and emotional transformation. She wanders the coastal regions, gathering followers and preparing for what she calls "the Great Tide."

## Description
- **Appearance**: Ethereal sea elf with silver-blue hair that moves like underwater kelp
- **Eyes**: Deep blue with flecks of silver, seem to reflect depths of ocean
- **Mark of the Shard**: Intricate wave patterns flow across her skin when she prophesies
- **Voice**: Speaks in rhythmic cadences that match the sound of waves
- **Presence**: Emanates calm that can soothe even the most troubled souls

## Background
### The Calling
- Born to a traditional sea elf clan on [[The Azure Coast]]
- Experienced prophetic dreams from childhood
- At age 16, had a vision that led her to dive impossibly deep
- Briefly touched the Azure Shard in its sunken temple
- Emerged three days later, transformed and speaking prophecies

### The Wandering Years
- Spent 12 years traveling coastal communities
- Gathered followers among fishers, sailors, and coastal dwellers
- Predicted storms, tides, and sea disasters with perfect accuracy
- Founded the [[The Tide Speakers]] as a loose network of believers
- Never stays in one place more than a few months

## Prophetic Abilities
### Visions from the Azure Shard
- **Storm Sight**: Predicts weather and sea conditions weeks in advance
- **Emotional Currents**: Sees the flow of human emotions and relationships
- **Tide Dreams**: Visions of possible futures, always involving water
- **Soul Deep**: Can perceive people's deepest fears and desires
- **Shard Resonance**: Senses when other Shards are active or moving

### The Great Tide Prophecy
*"When the Seven become One, the Great Tide rises. Not of water alone, but of feeling, washing away all pretense and lies. Those who fight the current will drown in their own deceptions. Those who swim with it will find depths they never knew existed."*

## The Tide Speakers
### Followers

### Beliefs
- Water connects all living things
- Emotions are currents that flow between souls
- The Azure Shard will eventually "rise" and heal emotional wounds
- The coming Great Tide will wash away societal lies and pretenses
- Preparation, not resistance, is the path to survival

## Current Activities

- Travels more frequently, spreading warnings of "dark tides ahead"
- Recruits those with natural affinity for water magic
- Guides treasure hunters away from the Azure Shard's resting place

### Special Abilities

**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Nerissa fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

**Azure Shard Communion.** Nerissa maintains a deep psychic connection with the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards|Azure Shard]] resting in the sunken temple. This grants her prophetic visions and control over water and emotion.

**Prophetic Sight.** Nerissa can see multiple possible futures simultaneously. She has advantage on initiative rolls and cannot be surprised. Once per turn, she can grant an ally advantage on any roll by warning them of danger.

**Storm Form.** As a bonus action, Nerissa can become one with storm clouds for up to 1 hour. In this form, she gains fly speed 60 ft., resistance to all damage except psychic, and can pass through spaces as small as 1 inch.

**Tidal Empathy.** Nerissa can sense and influence the emotions of all creatures within 1 mile. She knows the general emotional state of everyone in the area and can project calming or inspiring feelings.

**Weather Mastery.** Nerissa can alter weather patterns within a 50-mile radius as an action. This functions as *control weather* but with no time limit and can create supernatural storms or calms.

**Oceanic Authority.** All sea creatures within 10 miles are friendly to Nerissa unless magically controlled. She can communicate with any aquatic creature and request their aid.

**Azure Resonance.** Nerissa can sense the location, emotional state, and general activities of all other Shard bearers. This connection is strongest with [[Gareth Goldenheart, The Chosen Vessel]] due to their complementary natures.

**Spellcasting.** Nerissa is an 18th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks). She knows the following spells:

- **Cantrips (at will):** guidance, mending, prestidigitation, shape water, thaumaturgy
- **1st level (4 slots):** cure wounds, detect magic, sanctuary, speak with animals
- **2nd level (3 slots):** augury, calm emotions, hold person, suggestion
- **3rd level (3 slots):** call lightning, clairvoyance, tidal wave, water breathing
- **4th level (3 slots):** control water, divination, freedom of movement, ice storm
- **5th level (3 slots):** commune, dominate person, scrying, maelstrom
- **6th level (1 slot):** find the path, heal, wind walk
- **7th level (1 slot):** plane shift, reverse gravity
- **8th level (1 slot):** control weather, tsunami
- **9th level (1 slot):** foresight, storm of vengeance

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Nerissa makes three attacks: two with Tidal Strike and one Emotional Current, or casts a spell and makes one attack.

**Tidal Strike.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +14 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (2d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed 15 feet away.

**Emotional Current.** Nerissa manipulates the emotions of up to 3 creatures within 60 feet. Each target must make a DC 22 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, choose one effect:
- **Despair**: Target is incapacitated by overwhelming sadness for 1 round
- **Rage**: Target must attack nearest creature (ally or enemy) on next turn
- **Fear**: Target is frightened and must use movement to get away from Nerissa
- **Joy**: Target is charmed and has disadvantage on attacks against Nerissa for 1 minute

**Azure Tsunami (1/Day).** Nerissa channels the Azure Shard's oceanic power. A 100-foot radius, 30-foot tall wave crashes down centered on a point within 300 feet. All creatures in the area must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 45 (10d8) bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. On a success, they take half damage and remain standing. The area becomes difficult terrain flooded with 10 feet of water for 1 hour.

**Prophetic Storm (3/Day).** Nerissa calls upon her visions to create a localized storm in a 60-foot radius. For 1 minute, all creatures in the area are subject to:
- Lightning strikes: Each creature takes 9 (2d8) lightning damage at the start of their turn (DC 22 Dex save for half)
- Prophetic winds: All creatures have disadvantage on ranged attacks
- Emotional thunder: All creatures must succeed on DC 22 Wisdom save each round or be stunned by overwhelming visions

**The Great Tide Vision (1/Day).** Nerissa shares her most powerful prophecy with all creatures within 120 feet. Each creature experiences a vision of their possible future. Allies gain inspiration and advantage on all rolls for 1 minute. Enemies must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened and stunned for 1 round as they see their potential doom.

**Shard Communion (1/Week).** Nerissa attempts direct communication with the Azure Shard. She can ask up to three questions about future events, which are answered with cryptic visions that always come true but may be misinterpreted.

### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)
Nerissa can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.

**Move.** Nerissa moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks, potentially shifting into Storm Form.

**Prophetic Warning.** Nerissa grants one ally within 60 feet advantage on their next saving throw or ability check.

**Tidal Control.** Nerissa manipulates existing water within 120 feet, creating difficult terrain, providing cover, or moving objects.

**Emotional Wave (Costs 2 Actions).** Nerissa uses Emotional Current or casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.

**Storm Manifestation (Costs 3 Actions).** Nerissa calls down a lightning strike on any creature within 120 feet. The target must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) lightning damage on a failure (half on success).

### Lair Actions
When encountered at a coastal location or during a storm, Nerissa can take lair actions on initiative count 20:

**Rising Tide.** Water levels rise by 10 feet in a 500-foot radius. Creatures not adapted to water have their movement speed halved and disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity based attacks.

**Prophetic Winds.** Supernatural winds carry whispers of the future. All creatures in the area hear warnings or encouragement in their native language, gaining or losing inspiration based on their relationship to Nerissa.

**Emotional Maelstrom.** The air becomes thick with projected emotions. All creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be overwhelmed by feelings for 1 round (incapacitated as they process intense emotional visions).

**Azure Manifestation.** Nerissa temporarily manifests an aspect of the Azure Shard. A 60-foot radius area becomes filled with azure light. Allies gain resistance to all damage, while enemies have disadvantage on all rolls.

## Prophecies & Azure Wisdom

### The Great Tide Prophecies

#### The Convergence Tide
*"When seven lights gather, the Great Tide rises - not of water alone, but of feeling, memory, and choice. Those who fight the current drown in their own fears. Those who swim with it discover depths they never knew existed. The child of gold holds the key to whether this tide brings renewal or ending."*

#### The Emotional Storm
*"Before the Shards reunite, a storm of the heart must pass. All hidden feelings will rise to the surface - love and hate, hope and despair, truth and lies. No soul will remain unchanged. Only those who can weather their own emotions will survive to see the new dawn."*

#### The Azure Choice
*"The deepest waters hold the oldest memories. When the time comes, I must choose - remain safely in the depths with my Shard, or rise to the surface where the light may blind me but where I can guide others through the darkness."*

## Crisis Points & Character Development

### The Depth Calling
As the Convergence approaches, the Azure Shard's pull grows stronger:
- **Increasing Visions**: More frequent and intense prophetic experiences
- **Emotional Overload**: Feeling the emotions of larger populations becomes overwhelming
- **Physical Changes**: Beginning to develop more aquatic characteristics
- **Isolation Pressure**: Growing disconnect from surface dwellers and their concerns
- **Shard Dependency**: Needs more frequent communion to maintain prophetic abilities

### The Surface Choice
Nerissa faces an ultimate decision:

#### Remain in the Depths
- **Advantages**: Safe from surface conflicts, unlimited prophetic power, protection from corruption
- **Disadvantages**: Unable to directly help with Convergence, becomes irrelevant to surface events
- **Outcome**: Becomes guardian of oceanic mysteries but loses influence over world events

#### Rise to the Surface  
- **Advantages**: Can directly guide Shard reunification, help other bearers, protect innocent people
- **Disadvantages**: Vulnerable to enemy action, prophetic abilities may diminish, risks corruption
- **Outcome**: Becomes active player in final Convergence events with major influence on outcomes

#### The Middle Path
- **Advantages**: Maintains prophetic abilities while staying engaged with surface world
- **Disadvantages**: Constant travel and communication strain, never fully committed to either realm
- **Outcome**: Serves as bridge between deep mysteries and surface needs, crucial mediator role

### Potential Character Arcs

#### The Oracle's Sacrifice
- Realizes her visions of the future require her own sacrifice to come true
- Must choose between personal survival and saving others
- Becomes martyr whose death enables successful Shard reunification
- Legacy inspires others to make similar sacrificial choices

#### The Unified Prophet
- Successfully integrates surface and depth perspectives
- Becomes living bridge between Azure Shard and other Shard bearers
- Helps facilitate peaceful Shard reunification through emotional harmony
- Evolves into new form of divinity focused on empathy and understanding

#### The Lost Seer
- Overwhelmed by conflicting visions and emotional pressures
- Loses ability to distinguish between possible and actual futures
- Becomes cautionary tale about the costs of prophetic power
- Requires rescue/healing from other characters to regain sanity

#### The Rebellious Prophet
- Rejects predetermined fate shown in visions
- Uses prophetic knowledge to actively change predicted outcomes
- Becomes wildcard who disrupts everyone's plans for personal freedom
