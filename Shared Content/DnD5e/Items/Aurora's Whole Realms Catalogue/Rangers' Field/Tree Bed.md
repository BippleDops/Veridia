## Description
Sleeping unprotected on the ground is not only dangerous, but also uncomfortable. We therefore offer a tree bed (8 gp). This gnomish contraption stretches a canvas sheet across a wooden frame that can be lashed in place upon most any tree. The tree bed provides a comfortable sleep removed from the dirty earth and away from the notice of roaming beasts. For an added 2 gp, we will include a pitched roof, turning the tree bed into a private tent for times of cold or rain.

## Additional Details
wt: 8 lb; not useful outside of trees
