See the "rules glossary" for how to read a [[stat-block-xphb (variant-rules), and see the *Bestiary Compendium* for even more creatures. The following stat blocks are presented in alphabetical order. When the Dungeon Master uses a stat block, the DM may change details in it. - [Giant Ape Xmm]] - [[giant-badger-xmm (beast) - [Giant Bat Xmm]] - [[black-bear-xmm - [giant-boar-xmm]] - [[brown-bear-xmm (beast) - [Camel Xmm]] - [[cat-xmm (beast) - [giant-constrictor-snake-xmm (beast)]] - [[giant-crab-xmm (beast) - [Crocodile Xmm]] - [[dire-wolf-xmm - [draft-horse-xmm (beast)]] - [[elephant-xmm (beast) - [elk-xmm (beast)]] - [[frog-xmm (beast) - [giant]] - [[giant - [Goat Xmm]] - [[giant - [giant-spider-xmm (beast)]] - [[giant - [Goat Xmm]] - [[Blood Hawk Xmm - [Imp Xmm]] - [[lion-xmm (beast) - [lizard-xmm (beast)]] - [[Mastiff Xmm - [mule-xmm (beast)]] - [[Giant Octopus Xmm - [Giant Owl Xmm]] - [[Panther Xmm - [pony-xmm (beast)]] - [[pseudodragon-xmm (dragon) - [quasit-xmm (fiend)]] - [[Wererat Xmm - [Raven Xmm]] - [[Reef Shark Xmm - [riding-horse-xmm]] - [[Giant Scorpion Xmm - [flaming-skeleton-xmm (undead)]] - [[slaad-tadpole-xmm (aberration) - [sphinx]] - [[phase-spider-xmm (monstrosity) - [sprite-xmm (fey)]] - [[Weretiger Xmm - [venomous-snake-xmm]] - [[warhorse-xmm (beast) - [giant-weasel-xmm (beast)]] - [[werewolf-xmm (monstrosity) - [Zombie Xmm]] ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary 10 appendix b creature stat blocks is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of 10 appendix b creature stat blocks as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around 10 appendix b creature stat blocks. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
