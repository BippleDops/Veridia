*2nd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sumac leaf)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke it again as a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]].

As a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you can make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes Fire damage equal to `3d6` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

The flaming blade sheds [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]] in a 10-foot radius and [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] for an additional 10 feet.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d6` for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes**: [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid|Druid]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer|Sorcerer]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Bard (College of Lore)]]
