## Description
Our loincloth takes the standard undergarment to new levels! While the old loincloth was simply a strip of cloth designed to conceal, this new version upgirds as well. Whether you are an oiled-muscled, sword-swinging barbarian who wears nothing else, or a fine young nobleman who desires more comfort, our loincloths are perfect. We stock loincloths in wool, linen, and a weave of absorbent Maztican cotton, as well as silk, velvet, and leather (all for double the cost).

## Additional Details
Gnome: 3 sp; halfling: 4 sp; elf: 5 sp; human; 6 sp. Please designate ecto-, meso-, or endomorphic when ordering.
