# Potion of Poison

## Overview
**Type**: Magic Item

**Group**: *Potions*

**Rarity**: *Uncommon*


## Description
This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a **[[Potion of Healing|potion of healing]]** or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually [[17 - Damage and Healing|poison]] masked by [[Illusion|illusion]] magic. An **[[Identify|identify]]** spell reveals its true [[Intelligence|nature]].

If you drink it, you take `dice: 3d6` (3d6) [[17 - Damage and Healing|poison]] damage, and you must succeed on a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 13 [[Constitution|Constitution]] saving throw or be [[Poisoned|poisoned]]. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take `dice: 3d6` (3d6) [[17 - Damage and Healing|poison]] damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by `dice: 1d6` (1d6). The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.
