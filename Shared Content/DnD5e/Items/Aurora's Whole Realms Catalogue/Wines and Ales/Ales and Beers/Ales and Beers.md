# Ales and Beers
## Overview
Beers Nearly every dale, village, town, and city in Faerun has a brewery that makes a local concoction of variable quality and entertains a parochial following among its patrons. But the brews I offer are easily transported or of the finest quality, which makes them worth the time and effort. Though I cannot personally vouch for the taste and judging of these brews (my palate prefers wines, though a sip of Luiren’s Best is a wonder with a bit of nut cheese), my staff vouches for, and dips into, them all. Clearly I can’t stock every brew: selections not offered are limited by travel, supply, or demand.
