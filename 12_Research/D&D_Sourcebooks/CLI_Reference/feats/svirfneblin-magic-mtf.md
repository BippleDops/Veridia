# Svirfneblin Magic
*Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 114, Elemental Evil Player's Companion p. 7, Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide p. 115*  

**Prerequisite**: [[gnome-deep-mtf|Gnome (Deep)]]

You have inherited the innate spellcasting ability of your ancestors. This ability allows you to cast [[nondetection-xphb|nondetection]] on yourself at will, without needing a material component. You can also cast each of the following spells once with this ability: [[blindness-deafness-xphb|blindness/deafness]], [[blur-xphb|blur]], and [[disguise-self-xphb|disguise self]]. You regain the ability to cast these spells when you finish a long rest.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells, and you cast them at their lowest possible levels.
