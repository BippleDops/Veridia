--- > [!figure] View # Shadow Merchant Riptide **Role:** Information Broker and Black Market Dealer **Location:** [[Shadow Market Canals - Mobile operations **Affiliations:** [Shadow Surgeons Collective]], [[The Whisper Syndicate **Specialties:** Memory trafficking, identity forgery, political blackmail ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Riptide operates as one of [Aquabyssos]]'s most dangerous information brokers, dealing in stolen memories, forged identities, and political secrets. His network spans from the deepest criminal organizations to corrupt government officials. What makes him particularly dangerous is his collection of "insurance memories" - compromising experiences extracted from powerful figures that ensure his protection and influence. ## Appearance and Demeanor

**Physical**: Tall, gaunt figure with pale skin marked by surgical scars. His eyes constantly shift color due to crystalline implants that help him process stolen memories. Wears expensive but understated clothing that conceals numerous hidden weapons and magical devices. **Mannerisms**: - Speaks in whispers, forcing others to lean in to hear him
- Frequently references conversations and events he shouldn't know about
- Touches his temple when accessing implanted memories
- Never meets in the same location twice
- Always has three escape routes planned ## Background and History

**Origins**: Former [[Memory Farmers apprentice who discovered the profit potential in stolen experiences **Corruption**: Made a pact with an entity from the shadow realm in exchange for power over memories **Rise to Power**: Systematically blackmailed his way into becoming one of [Aquabyssos]]'s most feared criminals **Current Status**: Untouchable due to the secrets he holds, but constantly paranoid about rivals ### Combat Capabilities

**AS**: 16 (Studded Leather + Dex) **HP**: 112 (`dice: 16d8` + 32) **Speed**: 30 ft., swim 40 ft. **Saving Throws**: Dex +8, Cha +6 **Key Abilities**:
- **Memory Drain**: Touch attack that steals recent memories and temporarily stuns target
- **Shadow Step**: Teleport through shadows up to 60 feet as bonus action
- **Suggestion**: Implant false memories to control behavior (Warlock feature)
- **Sneak Attack**: +`dice: 4d6` damage when conditions are met
- **Uncanny Dodge**: Half damage from one attack per round ### Magical Equipment

**Ring of Memory Storage**: Can store up to 12 complete memory sequences **Cloak of Displacement**: Disadvantage on attacks against him **Dagger of Soul Cutting**: Weapon that damages both body and memories **Crystal of True Sight**: See through illusions and detect magical deceptions ### Information Network

**Informants**: 200+ agents throughout [[Aquabyssos and beyond **Memory Banks**: Vast collection of stolen experiences organized by subject **Blackmail Files**: Compromising information on dozens of powerful figures **Communication Network**: Crystal-based system for instant contact with agents ### Information Brokerage

**Criminal Organizations**: Regular business with all major underworld groups **Corrupt Officials**: Government figures who buy silence and favorable information **Wealthy Patrons**: Rich individuals seeking embarrassing memories removed **Foreign Agents**: Spies from other realms purchasing sensitive intelligence ### The Parliament Project

**Goal**: Collect compromising memories from all [Parliament of Echoes]] members **Method**: Infiltration through corrupted staff and staged "accidents" **Purpose**: Ultimate political control through comprehensive blackmail **Progress**: 60% complete, accelerating due to recent opportunities ### The Surface Connection

**Goal**: Establish information trading network with [[Aethermoor **Method**: Working through surface smugglers and diplomatic contacts **Purpose**: Corner the market on inter-realm intelligence **Obstacles**: [Admiral Thorne Blackwater]]'s increased security measures ### The Memory Monopoly

**Goal**: Control all memory-related criminal activities in [[Aquabyssos **Method**: Systematically eliminating or absorbing rival operations **Purpose**: Become the sole source of memory trafficking services **Current Target**: [Memory Farmers]] traditional operations ### Allies and Partners

**Criminal Underworld**: Respected and feared as the ultimate information source **Government Officials**: Known as dangerous but sometimes necessary contact **General Public**: Urban legend figure - most believe he doesn't really exist **Law Enforcement**: Priority target but untouchable due to political connections ### The Warlock Pact

**Patron**: Entity known as "The Forgotten God" from the shadow realm **Price**: Must feed his patron a certain number of memories each month **Power**: Enhanced ability to manipulate and steal memories **Consequence**: Slowly losing his own identity as patron consumes his memories ### Personal Vulnerabilities

**Memory Fragmentation**: Can't remember his original name or early life **Patron Dependency**: Without regular memory sacrifices, loses all supernatural abilities **Trust Issues**: Paranoid behavior stems from accurate assessment of constant danger **Hidden Conscience**: Still experiences guilt about his victims, buried deep in his psyche ### Character Development

- Could become ally if party proves trustworthy and useful long-term
- Might seek redemption if confronted with full consequences of his actions
- Could be redeemed through sacrifice that saves others from his fate
- Alternatively, could become increasingly corrupted and dangerous over time > [!danger] DM Secret

> Riptide is actually the original founder of the [[Shadow Surgeons Collective, but he had his own memories of this fact surgically removed to protect himself from retaliation. The current leadership of the Collective doesn't know their organization's true origins, and Riptide himself has forgotten why he sometimes experiences unexplained familiarity with their operations. If this truth is revealed, it could either destroy the Collective or reunite it under his leadership, dramatically shifting the criminal landscape of [Aquabyssos]]. ## Player-Facing Summary Shadow Merchant Riptide is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Shadow Merchant Riptide as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Shadow Merchant Riptide. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
