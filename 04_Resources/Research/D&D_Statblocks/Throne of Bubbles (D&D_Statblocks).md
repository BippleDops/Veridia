The Throne of Bubbles is both a person and an institutionâ€”the ancient ruler who has literally become one with their seat of power. For over four centuries, this sovereign has ruled [[Abyssos Prime|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Abyssos Prime]] from within a massive throne made of living coral and perpetual bubble streams. The current occupant, whose original name has been forgotten by all but themselves, exists in a state of suspended animation, breathing both air and water simultaneously while making pronouncements that ripple through the currents of political power. The Throne itself is a marvel of ancient magicâ€”a living coral structure that continuously generates streams of luminescent bubbles carrying the sovereign's consciousness throughout the underwater realm. The ruler's body has partially merged with the throne over centuries, making it unclear where the person ends and the seat of power begins. ## Secrets & Hidden Knowledge

*"Through bubbles I speak, and in their popping, wisdom is heard. What message do my current-words carry to your understanding?"* - Formal court address *"Four centuries I have watched the tides of politics ebb and flow. Your concerns, while immediate to you, are but drops in the eternal ocean of goverce."* - To impatient petitioners *"The throne does not merely ruleâ€”it serves. Every bubble that rises carries the weight of my subjects' needs and dreams."* - Royal philosophy *"Democracy and monarchy need not be enemies, child of the depths. Like currents meeting, they can strengthen each other."* - On political evolution *(Bubble-speech becomes increasingly cryptic when discussing prophecies or ancient knowledge)* ## Player-Facing Summary Throne of Bubbles is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
