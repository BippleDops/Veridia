# Heightened Spell
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 142. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span>*  

When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to give one target of the spell [Disadvantage](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on saves against the spell.

## Player-Facing Summary

Heightened spell xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of heightened spell xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around heightened spell xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties heightened spell xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at heightened spell xphb to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to heightened spell xphb active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
