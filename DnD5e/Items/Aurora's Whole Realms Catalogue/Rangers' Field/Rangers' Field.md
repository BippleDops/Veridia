# Rangers' Field
## Overview
I do not offer weapons or armor: few fighters would buy a long-sword not crafted and weighted for his or her stance, or buy armor as though it were stretchable stockings. Even so, my catalogue does contain equipment for warriors. The following equipment works well not only in the hands of a ranger, but also in those of any warrior who spends much time in the wilderness. The hunting and fishing gear are incomparable, and the tree seats and beds suit anyone on the prowl for orcs. All of our ranger gear is constructed of durable and light-weight material and fits easily onto our equipment frame.
