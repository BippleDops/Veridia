## Legendary Resistance (3/Day)
If Thalassius fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

## Special Abilities

**Ancient Sovereignty.** Thalassius has advantage on saving throws against being turned and is immune to effects that would alter his form. Aquatic creatures must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw to attack him directly.

**Depth-Blessed Immortality.** Unlike typical liches, Thalassius's phylactery is the entire Sunken Throne itself, blessed by the [[Deep Mother]]. He regenerates 20 hit points at the start of his turn if he has at least 1 hit point and is within Aquabyssos.

**Master of Tides.** Thalassius can control water within 1 mile, creating currents, whirlpools, or calm seas at will. This functions as the *control water* spell but requires no concentration.

**Memory of Empire.** Thalassius can access the memories of any creature that has ever sworn fealty to the Aquabyssos throne. As an action, he can perfectly recall any event witnessed by a subject, living or dead.

**Pressure Aura.** Creatures within 30 feet must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the start of their turn or suffer disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks as crushing pressure bears down upon them. Aquatic creatures have advantage on this save.

**Spellcasting.** Thalassius is a 20th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit). He has the following wizard spells prepared:
- Cantrips (at will): *chill touch*, *mage hand*, *prestidigitation*, *ray of frost*, *shape water*
- 1st level (4 slots): *detect magic*, *magic missile*, *shield*, *thunderwave*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts*, *mirror image*, *misty step*, *hold person*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell*, *dispel magic*, *tidal wave*, *water breathing*
- 4th level (3 slots): *control water*, *dimension door*, *greater invisibility*, *phantasmal killer*
- 5th level (3 slots): *dominate person*, *scrying*, *telekinesis*, *wall of force*
- 6th level (2 slots): *chain lightning*, *disintegrate*, *globe of invulnerability*
- 7th level (2 slots): *finger of death*, *plane shift*, *reverse gravity*
- 8th level (1 slot): *dominate monster*, *power word stun*, *tsunami*
- 9th level (1 slot): *power word kill*, *time stop*, *wish*

## Actions

**Multiattack.** Thalassius makes two attacks: one with his Trident of the Depths and one with his Depth Blast.

**Trident of the Depths.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d6 + 7) piercing damage plus 21 (6d6) cold damage. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed by crushing pressure for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.

**Depth Blast.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +14 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (8d6) force damage, and the target must make a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pushed 30 feet away and knocked prone.

**Disintegrating Touch (Recharge 5-6).** *Melee Spell Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* The target must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 75 (10d6 + 40) force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.

## Legendary Actions

Thalassius can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Thalassius regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

- **Cantrip.** Thalassius casts a cantrip.
- **Depth Shift (Costs 2 Actions).** Thalassius becomes invisible until the start of his next turn and teleports up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space he can see.
- **Imperial Command (Costs 3 Actions).** Thalassius targets one creature he can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours. While charmed, the creature obeys Thalassius's verbal commands. The creature can repeat the saving throw whenever it takes damage.

## Lair Actions

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Thalassius takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects:

- The pressure in a 60-foot radius sphere increases dramatically. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) force damage and be restrained until initiative count 20 on the next round.
- Thalassius creates a whirlpool in a 40-foot radius, 40-foot high cylinder. Creatures must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pulled 20 feet toward the center.
- The emperor calls upon ancient memories, causing ghostly apparitions of past subjects to appear. Each enemy within 60 feet must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.

## Description

Emperor Thalassius the Wise has ruled Aquabyssos for over three thousand years, transforming from benevolent king to undead sovereign through a pact with the [[Deep Mother]] herself. Unlike the twisted liches of the surface world, Thalassius maintained his sanity and noble bearing through the transformation, though his flesh has long since given way to translucent, jellyfish-like tissue stretched over ancient bones that gleam with deep-sea phosphorescence.

Standing seven feet tall even in his hunched, eternal posture, Thalassius wears the corroded crown of the first emperor, now fused to his skull through millennia of pressure and magic. His eyes are twin abyssal pearls that glow with an eerie blue-green light, seeing through time itself. Barnacles and coral growths decorate his form like jewelry, and schools of bioluminescent fish swim through his partially translucent body, living symbols of his unity with the ocean depths.

The emperor rarely leaves the Sunken Throne, a massive chamber at the heart of [[Abyssos Prime - Inverse Palace]], where the water itself bows to his will. Here, surrounded by the fossilized remains of his original court, he contemplates the eternal balance between the depths and the surface, between [[Aquabyssos]] and [[Aethermoor]], between life and undeath.

## History

Thalassius was once a mortal king who united the warring underwater kingdoms through diplomacy and wisdom rather than conquest. When the Great Drowning threatened to destroy all civilization in the depths, he made the ultimate sacrifice: accepting undeath to become an eternal guardian of his people. The ritual, performed by the high priests of the [[Deep Mother]], bound his soul not to a single phylactery but to the very throne of Aquabyssos itself.

For three millennia, he has maintained the delicate balance of power in the depths, preventing wars between the various underwater races, negotiating with the aboleths of the deepest trenches, and maintaining the ancient treaties with surface nations. His transformation into lichdom was seen not as a curse but as the ultimate act of self-sacrifice for his people.

## Equipment

- **Crown of the Drowned Empire** (artifact - grants control over all water within 1 mile, immunity to mental effects)
- **Trident of the Depths** (legendary weapon - +3 trident that commands sea creatures)
- **Robes of the Eternal Deep** (grants resistance to all damage while underwater)
- **Ring of the Deep Emperor** (allows communication with any creature in Aquabyssos)
- **The Codex Abyssal** (spellbook containing every spell ever created underwater)

- **Communication Challenges**: Vast distances and extreme environments complicate central coordination

## Quest Hooks

1. **The Emperor's Memory** - Thalassius has begun forgetting events from his early reign, suggesting someone is stealing or corrupting the empire's history. He secretly seeks heroes to investigate without alerting the court.

2. **The Succession Question** - Despite his immortality, Thalassius seeks an heir who could rule should he fall. The trials to prove worthiness involve retrieving artifacts from the deepest trenches.

3. **The Ancient Pact** - The original agreement with the [[Deep Mother]] requires renewal every thousand years. The time approaches, but the goddess has gone silent, and disturbing signs suggest something has happened to her.

4. **Diplomatic Summit** - Thalassius calls for a grand assembly between [[Aquabyssos]] and [[Aethermoor]] to address the growing shadow corruption. He needs capable agents to ensure the summit isn't sabotaged.

5. **The Living Throne** - The Sunken Throne itself has begun to exhibit signs of consciousness, possibly due to the accumulated souls and memories within it. Thalassius fears he may be losing control of his own phylactery.

## Secrets

- **The True Price**: Thalassius's immortality requires the sacrifice of one royal bloodline member every century, a secret known only to him and the high priests.
- **The Fractured Soul**: His consciousness exists in multiple temporal states simultaneously, allowing him to perceive past, present, and potential futures, but causing increasing instability.
- **The Shadow Pact**: He once made a deal with shadow entities to protect Aquabyssos from a greater threat, a debt that may soon be called.
- **Memory Prison**: Within his palace lies a chamber where he stores the extracted memories of traitors and enemies, creating a living archive of sedition.
- **The Heir Apparent**: He has already chosen a successor but keeps their identity secret, even from them, training them through mysterious dreams and visions.

## Motivations

**Primary**: Maintain the eternal stability and prosperity of Aquabyssos at any cost
**Secondary**: Prevent the shadow corruption from consuming both realms
**Hidden**: Find a way to truly die while ensuring the empire's continuation

## Roleplaying Notes

**Personality**: Ancient, patient, and melancholic. Speaks in formal, archaic patterns with the weight of millennia behind every word. Often references events from centuries ago as if they happened yesterday.

**Ideals**: "An empire is not built on strength alone, but on the willingness to sacrifice everything for those who cannot protect themselves."

**Bonds**: "I am Aquabyssos, and Aquabyssos is me. We shall endure together or fall as one."

**Flaws**: "I have seen so many generations pass that individual lives sometimes seem fleeting and insignificant. This detachment grows stronger each century."

**Voice**: Speaks in a deep, echoing tone that seems to come from the ocean itself. His words carry the sound of distant tides and whale songs. Often pauses mid-sentence as if consulting memories from ages past.

**Mannerisms**: Never hurries, moves with the deliberate grace of deep currents. Occasionally, small fish swim through his translucent form. His crown constantly drips water that never seems to run out.
