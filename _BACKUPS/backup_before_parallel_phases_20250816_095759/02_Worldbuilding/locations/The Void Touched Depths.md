## Overview

The Void Touched Depths represent one of [[Aquabyssos's most terrifying natural phenomena: a massive trench system where reality itself has been infected by something from beyond the cosmos. Located at [Crushing Depths]] where even [[Aboleth|[Aboleth Prime Yoth]] fears to venture, these trenches pulse with an alien hunger that consumes not just matter and energy, but concepts, memories, and the fundamental building blocks of existence itself.

### The Screaming Gradient (18,000-20,000 feet)

**[[The Threshold of Madness**
- Water becomes viscous with dissolved nightmares
- Gravitational anomalies pull in multiple directions simultaneously
- Temperature: 32Â°F (0Â°C) but heat is actively drained from living beings
- Pressure: 540 atmospheres (instant death for unprepared)
- First whispers of [[Oracle|The Void Touched [Oracle]]]] begin here
- Bioluminescent organisms glow with impossible colors

### The Consumption Zone (20,000-22,000 feet)

**Where Existence Becomes Optional**
- Matter randomly phases in and out of reality
- Living creatures begin experiencing "existence stuttering"
- [[Time flows in broken fragments
- Temperature: Meaninglessâ€”cold is a concept being devoured
- Pressure: Non-Euclidean (affects soul as much as body)
- The Void's influence becomes actively hostile

### The Heart of Void (22,000-25,000 feet)

**The Cosmic Wound**
- Reality is completely unstableâ€”laws of physics are suggestions
- Multiple dimensions overlap and cancel each other out
- Temperature: The concept of temperature has been eaten
- Pressure: Exists in quantum superposition
- The Void Touched Oracle's true form resides here
- Portal to the space between spaces

#### The Unnamed Things

**CR 15 (Individual) / CR 20 (Swarm)**
- Creatures that exist in the spaces between thoughts
- Cannot be directly observedâ€”only their effects
- Feed on the concept of identity
- Leave reality tears in their wake
- Reproduce by consuming memories of themselves

#### Existence Feeders

**CR 12**
- Shark-like entities that hunt by erasing prey from reality
- Bite attacks remove targets from the [Timeline]] temporarily
- Invisible until they attack
- Pack hunters that coordinate across dimensions
- Leave "existence shadows" of their victims

#### Void Touched [[Leviathans

**CR 18**
- Massive creatures partially phased out of reality
- Can attack from multiple dimensions simultaneously
- Immune to conventional damage
- Their presence causes reality instability in 1-mile radius
- Each one is uniqueâ€”no two follow same physical laws

#### The Probability Fish

**CR Variable (1-20 depending on observation)**
- Schools of fish that exist in quantum superposition
- Observing them collapses their wave function unpredictably
- May become harmless minnows or cosmic horrors
- Their movements predict future disasters
- Sought after by [Prophet Nerida Voidgazer]] for divination

### Existence Drain

****DC 25** Constitution save every 10 minutes**
- Failure: Lose one aspect of identity (memory, skill, relationship)
- Critical Failure: Begin phasing out of reality
- Accumulative: Each failure increases next DC by 2
- Protection: Conceptual anchors, reality-stabilizing crystals

### Reality Stutters

**Random occurrence every hour (roll d20, 1-3 triggers)**
- Everything freezes for `dice: 1d4` rounds except consciousness
- During stutter: see all possible outcomes of current situation
- After stutter: one random possibility becomes reality
- May result in paradoxes that damage sanity

### Void Whispers

****DC 20** Wisdom save when entering any zone**
- Failure: Hear the Void Touched Oracle's voice
- Oracle offers power in exchange for "small sacrifices"
- Each deal erases something the character values
- Eventually leads to complete void corruption
- Success: Immunity for 24 hours

### [[Temporal Displacement

**Automatic effect in Heart of Void**
- Characters may arrive before they left
- Actions can prevent their own past decisions
- Meeting past/future selves causes reality fractures
- Only one timeline can ultimately survive
- Changes ripple through all of Aquabyssos history

### Void Crystals

**Legendary Material**
- Crystallized nothingness that weighs negative mass
- Can store anti-magic and un-spells
- One crystal can power reality stabilizers for months
- Harvesting requires sacrificing memories to the void
- Worth more than kingdoms to the right buyers

### Existence Essence

**Divine Component**
- Distilled reality in liquid form
- Can restore erased beings back to existence
- One drop can heal any conceptual damage
- Formation process unknown and irreproducible
- Guarded by [The Oracle]]'s most loyal servants

### Probability Pearls

**Rare Magical Items**
- Form inside creatures exposed to quantum uncertainty
- Allow manipulation of chance and causality
- Each use has 10% chance of creating paradox
- Highly sought by [[Sage Lysander Deepthought
- Can be weaponized to cause reality cascades

### Temporal Amber

**Ancient Preservation Medium**
- Fossilized time containing prehistoric moments
- Viewing reveals events from before [The Drowning]]
- Can be broken to release temporal energy
- Some pieces contain still-living pre-flood creatures
- Key ingredient in chronomantic rituals

### [[Memory Pearls of the Consumed

**Tragic Artifacts**
- Final thoughts of those erased by the void
- Contain skills and knowledge of the consumed
- Using them spreads void corruption
- Some hold secrets lost to history
- Collected obsessively by the [Silverscale Consortium]]

### Identity and Nature

**The Cosmic Wound's Voice**
- Once-mortal explorer who discovered the void portal
- Fused with alien intelligence from beyond reality
- Exists partially outside spacetime
- Speaks in overlapping voices from multiple timelines
- Cannot lie but truth changes based on observation

### The Oracle's Bargains

- **Knowledge of the Future**: Cost - Forget your past
- **Power over Reality**: Cost - Sacrifice someone you love to void
- **Immortality**: Cost - Existence becomes provisional

*"In the end, we learned that some mysteries are meant to remain unsolvedâ€”not because they're complex, but because understanding them means ceasing to exist. The void doesn't just kill you. It makes it so you never were, and that's a fate infinitely worse than death."*

â€”Final log entry of the *Deep Discovery*, recorded after the ship's destruction
