## Description
Much as the North prizes its [[Nut Cheeses|nut cheeses]], Tethyr is known for its spice cheeses, and best known for its pepper cheese, which mixes southern spices in with a mixture of goat and cow cheese to form a tangy, supple concoction. The leathery rind is dotted with peppercorns to give the cheese a unique appearance. The pepper and other spices give the pepper cheese its own unique flavor, perfect with southern dishes. Available in 1 lb loaves (5 sp) or 100 lb wheys (45 gp).
