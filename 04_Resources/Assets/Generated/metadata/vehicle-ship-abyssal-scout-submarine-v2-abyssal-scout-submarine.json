  "revised_prompt": "Create an image styled like a tabletop role-playing game with a medieval fantasy theme. The image should be a blueprint cutaway view of an Abyssal Scout Submarine, shown from the top, side, and cross-section views displaying the decks, ballast, pressure hulls, and engines. There should be a consistent, painterly collection style used throughout the illustration. Include crew members, using a balanced representation of genders and descents, garbed in culturally coherent gear that aligns with the grounded medieval fantasy materials. The marine vessel should be constructed from fantasy nautical materials, suggestive of underwater caustics with accentuated bioluminescence. Use a color palette of teals, deep blues, sea-greens, and pearl highlights. Avoid any modern technological elements, garbled, random symbols, and sci-fi user interfaces. Rather, stick to meaningful symbols or numbered pins, accompanying with a clean, uncomplicated legend. The end product should embody fantasy aquatic realism and the aesthetic of sturdy blueprint vernacular.",
