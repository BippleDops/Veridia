## The Legend

Long before [[Aquabyssos]] became the great underwater metropolis it is today, when the first tide-touched settlers were still building their [[Coral]] foundations, a terrible betrayal nearly doomed the entire colony. This is the tale of **Captain Nereon Truthkeeper**, whose name was struck from the honor rolls but whose sacrifice saved thousands.

### The Deep Watch Incident

During the early years of Aquabyssos construction, when the [[Deep Mother]]'s influence was still unknown to surface dwellers, Captain Nereon commanded the **Deep Watch** - elite guards tasked with protecting the colony's expanding borders from the crushing darkness below. His unit of twelve brave souls patrolled [[Abyssal Trenches]]]], ensuring no threats emerged from the oceanic depths.

On the Night of Screaming Waters, Nereon's patrol encountered something that defied all understanding: writhing masses of organic machinery, pustulent growths that sang with voices of the [[Drowned]], and geometric impossibilities that hurt to perceive directly. Three of his guards were consumed instantly, their bodies transformed into living conduits for an alien consciousness.

### The Choice

Faced with an enemy that could corrupt his remaining soldiers simply through proximity, Nereon made the unthinkable choice. Rather than return to Aquabyssos and risk spreading the contagion, he ordered his surviving eight guards to flee while he sealed the cavern entrance with depth charges, trapping himself inside with the horrors.

The [[Tidal Council]] branded him a deserter when his unit returned with tales of his "cowardice." The official record stated he abandoned his post during a routine patrol, leaving his men to face unknown dangers alone.

### The Official History

*As recorded in the Aquabyssos Military Archives*

Captain Nereon abandoned his post during the Deep Watch incident, forcing his subordinates to complete the mission without proper leadership. His cowardice resulted in the loss of three guardsmen and compromised security protocols. His name is stricken from honor rolls by order of the [[Tidal Council]].

### The Survivors' Account  

*Whispered in military taverns*

The captain saw something down there that broke lesser minds. Whatever was in those caves, it was changing [[People]], making them into something else. Nereon saved us all by sealing himself in with those things. He's no deserter - he's the bravest soul who ever lived.

### The Deep Mystics' Truth

*From the hidden texts of abyssal scholars*

The Deserter's Tale marks humanity's first documented encounter with agents of the [[Deep Mother]]. Captain Nereon's sacrifice prevented an early manifestation event that would have corrupted Aquabyssos from within. His "desertion" was actually the first successful containment of extra-dimensional intrusion.

## Connection to Current Events

Strange geometric coral formations have begun appearing near the old sealed cavern. [[Parliament of Echoes]]]] has classified the area as forbidden, but deep-current [[Smuggler]]s report hearing familiar screaming songs during their illegal salvage runs.

Recent expeditions to expand Aquabyssos's lower districts have uncovered traces of Nereon's final stand: blast scars on cavern walls, corroded weapons bearing the Deep Watch insignia, and most disturbing of all, a series of carved warnings in multiple languages including some that shouldn't exist.

## Mechanical Effects

**The Deserter's Stigma**
Characters who openly defend Nereon's reputation or claim his tale as inspiration may face:
- -2 to social rolls with military officials
- +2 to resistance rolls against corruption/mind control
- Access to hidden caches of Deep Watch equipment

**Truthkeeper's Resolve** (Ritual/Spell Effect)
By invoking Nereon's sacrifice, a character can:
- Seal a small area against supernatural intrusion for 24 hours
- Resist one corruption/transformation effect per day
- Rally [[Allies]] against overwhelming horror (+1 to group courage saves)

### The Vindication Campaign

[[Evidence]] surfaces that could clear Nereon's name. Do the PCs risk political scandal by presenting it to the [[Tidal Council]]? What forces want the truth buried?

### The Sealed Cavern

Recent seismic activity has damaged Nereon's blast seals. The PCs are hired to reinforce them, but discover the horrors within have been growing for decades. Can they contain what Nereon died to imprison?

### The Last Guard

One of Nereon's surviving guardsmen, now aged and dying, seeks the PCs to pass on a final secret: the [[location]] of the captain's hidden journal, which contains detailed accounts of [[Deep Mother]] corruption patterns.

### The Deserter's Daughter

A young [[Depth Warden]] claims to be Nereon's descendant and seeks to restore her family's honor. But is she truly his heir, or an agent of the very forces he died fighting?

### The Truth Beneath

Archaeological evidence suggests Nereon wasn't the first to make such a sacrifice. How many other "deserters" and "cowards" throughout Aquabyssos history were actually heroes fighting impossible battles?

## The Greater Mystery

Some scholars believe the Deserter's Tale is part of a larger pattern - that throughout both [[Aethermoor]] and Aquabyssos history, individuals have been making similar sacrifices to contain cosmic horrors, only to be branded as failures or traitors by those who cannot comprehend the true threat.

The tale raises uncomfortable questions: How many other "failures" were actually victories? What other sealed horrors lie waiting beneath the waves? And most disturbing of all - are there deserters still among us, fighting a secret war for the survival of both worlds?

*"Honor is not in glory, but in the darkness one enters willingly so others might live in light."* - Final transmission from Captain Nereon Truthkeeper
