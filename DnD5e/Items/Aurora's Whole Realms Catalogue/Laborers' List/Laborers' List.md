# Laborers' List
## Overview
Perhaps the only sight more fearful than a rampaging dragon is a rampaging crowd of villagers. A town united against a menacing monster and armed with the simple (but deadly) tools of common laborers can cow even the most savage army of foes. And of course, on a daily basis these same peasant heroes turn their tools to the mundane but no-less necessary task of sowing and reaping, chiseling and joining—the constant and wearying work that makes our world. In tribute to such folk, I offer a complete line of tools and implements for the common laborer— all of which will serve well in times of peace, and many of which can become weapons of defense in times of war.
