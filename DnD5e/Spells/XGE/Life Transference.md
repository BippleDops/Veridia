# Life Transference
You sacrifice some of your health to mend another creature's injuries. You take `dice: 4d8|avg` (4d8) necrotic damage, which can't be reduced in any way, and one creature of your choice that you can see within range regains a number of hit points equal to twice the necrotic damage you take.


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
