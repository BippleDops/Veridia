# Caltrops

## Overview
**Price**: 1 gp

**Weight**: 2 lb.

**Caltrops.** As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to [[16 - Cover|cover]] a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15 [[Dexterity|Dexterity]] saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.
