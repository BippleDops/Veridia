--- # Charm Person

*1st-level, Enchantment* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour One Humanoid you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. It does so with [[Advantage Xphb if you or your allies are fighting it. On a failed save, the target has the [conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] condition until the spell ends or until you or your allies damage it. The [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed creature is [friendly-attitude-xphb (variant-rules)]] to you. When the spell ends, the target knows it was [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed by you. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1. **Classes**: [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 249.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of charm person xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around charm person xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Strange disappearances suggest a curse
