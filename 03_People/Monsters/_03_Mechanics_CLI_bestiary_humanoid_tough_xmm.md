*The air carries the scent of [appropriate smell].*
*The air carries the scent of [appropriate smell].*mechanical depth. This system integrates with existing D&D 5e rules while adding meaningful choices and consequences. ## Core Mechanics ### Basic Resolution The fundamental process works as follows: 1. **Trigger**: Specific situation arises requiring this mechanic
2. **Setup**: Establish parameters and stakes
3. **Action**: Players create choices using the system
4. **Resolution**: Determine outcomes based on rolls and decisions
5. **Consequences**: Apply results to ongoing game ### Key Components #### Primary Mechanic - **Roll Type**: d20 + modifiers vs. DC
- **Difficulty Range**: DC 10-25 based on challenge
- **Modifiers**: Ability scores, proficiency, circumstances #### Resource Management - **Points/Uses**: Limited resource to track
- **Recovery**: How resources regenerate
- **Costs**: What actions consume resources #### Time Factor - **Action Economy**: How it fits in combat/exploration
- **Duration**: How long effects last
- **Frequency**: How often it can be used ## Detailed Rules ### Prerequisites Before using this mechanic:
- Specific conditions must be met
- Players must have certain capabilities
- DM establishes parameters ### Process #### Step 1: Initiation Determine when and how the mechanic activates:
- Player-triggered vs. DM-triggered
- Required declarations or preparations
- Cost or risk assessment #### Step 2: Execution The actual mechanical process:
1. Declare intended outcome
2. Commit resources (if applicable)
3. create necessary rolls
4. Apply modifiers and advantages
5. Compare to target numbers #### Step 3: Results Determining success and degree:
- **Critical Success** (20 or beat DC by 10+): Exceptional outcome
- **Success** (Meet or beat DC): Intended result achieved
- **Partial Success** (Fail by 5 or less): Limited success with complication
- **Failure** (Fail by 6+): Intended result not achieved
- **Critical Failure** (1 or fail by 10+): Significant negative consequence ### Modifiers & Advantages #### Circumstantial Modifiers - **Favorable conditions**: +2 to +5
- **Unfavorable conditions**: -2 to -5
- **Preparation**: Advantage on roll
- **Rushed/Pressured**: Disadvantage on roll #### Character Abilities - **Relevant proficiency**: Add proficiency bonus
- **Expertise**: Double proficiency bonus
- **Class features**: May provide unique benefits
- **Feats**: Could modify or enhance mechanic ## Examples ### Example 1: Basic Use * Scenario*: [Specific situation]
- Player declares intent
- DM sets DC 15
- Player rolls d20+5, gets 17
- Success achieved with described outcome ### Example 2: Complex Application * Scenario*: [More complex situation]
- Multiple participants involved
- Extended challenge requiring multiple rolls
- Resource management element
- Partial successes building to completion ### Example 3: Failed Attempt * Scenario*: [Failure situation]
- What went wrong
- Consequences of failure
- Recovery options
- Learning from failure ## Integration ### With Combat How this mechanic works during combat:
- Action/bonus action/reaction cost
- Interaction with initiative
- Effects on combat dynamics ### With Exploration Application during exploration:
- Time requirements
- Resource consumption
- Discovery opportunities
- Environmental interactions ### With Social Encounters Using in social situations:
- Influence on negotiations
- Reputation effects
- Information gathering
- Relationship building ## Variants & Options ### Simplified Version For quicker resolution:
- Single roll instead of multiple
- Fixed DCs instead of scaling
- Binary success/failure ### Advanced Version For more detail:
- Additional roll types
- Multiple resource tracks
- Expanded outcome table
- Long-term consequences ### Alternative Approaches Different ways to handle:
- Skill challenge format
- Narrative-focused resolution
- Point-buy system
- Card or dice pool mechanic ## Balance Considerations ### Power Level - Appropriate for tier of play
- Doesn't overshadow class abilities
- Maintains resource economy
- Preserves action economy ### Frequency of Use - Not every situation
- Special circumstances only
- Limited by resources
- Cooldown periods ### Risk vs. Reward - Meaningful consequences for failure
- Appropriate rewards for success
- Escalating stakes
- Player agency preserved ## Customization ### Setting-Specific Adapt for different settings:
- Fantasy adjustments
- Modern applications
- Science fiction variants
- Horror modifications ### Table Preferences Adjust for group style:
- More/less rolling
- Narrative focus
- Tactical emphasis
- Player comfort level ## Common Issues ### Problem 1: Overuse Solution: Implement cooldowns or costs ### Problem 2: Complexity Solution: Use simplified version initially ### Problem 3: Balance Solution: Adjust DCs and modifiers ## Designer Notes This mechanic aims to: - Add depth without overwhelming complexity
- Provide meaningful choices
- Create memorable moments
- Enhance rather than replace core rules ## Quick Reference **When to Use**: [Specific triggers] **Basic Roll**: d20 + modifier vs. DC
