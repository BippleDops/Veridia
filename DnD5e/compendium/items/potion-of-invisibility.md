# Potion of Invisibility
*Potion, minor, very rare*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

This potion's container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible) for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is [invisible](/rules/conditions.md#invisible) with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.
