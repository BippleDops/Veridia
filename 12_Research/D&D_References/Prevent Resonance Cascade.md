## Overview
Preventing a Resoce Cascade involves stopping the catastrophic chain reaction that occurs when magical energies between Aquabyssos and Aethermoor become destabilized and begin feeding back on themselves. This phenomenon threatens to tear apart the barriers between realms, potentially destroying both worlds in a cascade of uncontrolled magical energy.

The cascade begins when dimensional stress points reach critical thresholds, causing magic itself to become unstable. Spells begin failing unpredictably, magical items overload, and reality itself starts to warp around areas of high magical concentration.

## Historical Background
Resoce cascades were first theorized after minor magical feedback events during early inter-realm magical experiments. The devastating potential was confirmed when a small-scale cascade destroyed an entire research facility, creating a permanent magical dead zone.

## Current State
Warning signs of an impending major cascade are becoming apparent: increased magical instability, dimensional barrier fluctuations, and reports of reality distortions in high-magic areas. Prevention requires coordinated action across both realms.

### Duration
Prevention efforts must be completed within days or hours once cascade signs appear.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Early Warning**: Characters detect the first signs of cascade formation
2. **Emergency Response**: Racing against time to prevent cascade initiation
3. **Damage Control**: Managing the aftermath of a partially successful prevention effort

## Campaign Use
Ideal for high-stakes adventures where character actions have world-changing consequences. Can serve as campaign climax or major story arc resolution.
