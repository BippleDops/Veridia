# [[awakened zurkhwood oota|Awakened Zurkhwood]]
*Source: Out of the Abyss p. 230*  

This creature is an ordinary zurkhwood mushroom (see "Fungi of the Underdark" in chapter 2) given sentience and mobility. An awakened zurkhwood can be created by casting the [[awaken xphb|awaken]] spell on a normal zurkhwood mushroom. A myconid sovereign can create one by performing a lengthy ritual.

An awakened zurkhwood has the same statistics as an awakened tree (see appendix A of the Monster Manual), with the following modifications:

- The awakened zurkhwood has [[senses#Darkvision|darkvision]] out to a range of 120 feet.  
- If the awakened zurkhwood was created by a myconid sovereign, it can't speak.  
- The awakened zurkhwood's False Appearance feature allows it to be mistaken for a normal zurkhwood mushroom (instead of a tree).
