--- > [!figure] View # Madame Whisper *"Information, my dear, is like the deep currents - it flows where it will, but those who know how to read the patterns can profit from its movement."* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview Madame Whisper operates one of Aquabyssos's most exclusive and mysterious information networks, running what appears to be an upscale salon for the city's elite but actually serves as a sophisticated intelligence hub. Her establishment, "The Coral Garden Salon," provides luxury services while its proprietor collects, analyzes, and trades in the secrets of the powerful. Unlike crude spies or blackmailers, Madame Whisper positions herself as a refined purveyor of "social intelligence" - information that helps her clients navigate the complex political and social waters of Aquabyssos. Her services range from background checks on potential business partners to advance warning of political shifts that could affect her clients' interests. Her neutral stance and reputation for absolute discretion have made her salon a de facto neutral ground where representatives from opposing factions can meet safely, knowing that their conversations will remain confidential unless they specifically authorize otherwise. ## Appearance Madame Whisper appears to be an elegant sea elf woman of indeterminate age, with silver-white hair arranged in elaborate styles that change with her mood and the occasion. Her eyes are pale blue-green, seemingly innocent but missing nothing. She dresses in flowing gowns made from the finest sea silk, adorned with pearls and coral jewelry that serves both decorative and functional purposes. Her movements are graceful and deliberate, and she has an uncanny ability to appear exactly where she needs to be at the right moment. Many clients suspect she uses subtle magic to enhance her natural charisma and observational skills. ## Statistics

**Network of Whispers.** Madame Whisper can spend 10 minutes to gather information about any person, event, or organization in Aquabyssos. This functions as a *divination* spell with advantage on the roll. **Sanctuary of Secrets.** The Coral Garden Salon is under a permanent *sanctuary* effect. Additionally, any agreements made within the salon are magically binding unless both parties consent to their release. **Social Camouflage.** Madame Whisper has advantage on Charisma checks when interacting with nobility, merchants, or other social elites. ### Actions

**Subtle Dagger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (`dice: 1d4` + 3) piercing damage plus 10 (`dice: 3d6`) psychic damage as the blade carries whispered secrets that disturb the target's mind. **Compelling Suggestion.** Madame Whisper can cast *suggestion* three times per day without expending spell slots. **Information Exchange.** As an action, Madame Whisper can offer a piece of valuable information in exchange for another secret of equal value. Both parties must make a Wisdom saving throw (**DC 16**); those who fail feel compelled to share truthfully. ### Legendary Actions (3 per turn, when in her salon)

**Move.** Madame Whisper moves up to her speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
**Gather Intelligence.** Madame Whisper makes an Insight or Investigation check.
**Social Manipulation (Costs 2 Actions).** Madame Whisper uses her Compelling Suggestion ability. ## Background Madame Whisper's true identity and origins are themselves closely guarded secrets. She arrived in Aquabyssos fifteen years ago with sufficient wealth to establish her salon and immediately began building her network of informants and clients. Some speculate she was once a diplomat from another underwater realm, while others believe she may be a reformed spy seeking a more comfortable profession. What is known is that she possesses an exceptional talent for reading people and situations, combined with a natural charisma that makes others want to confide in her. Her salon quickly became the preferred social gathering place for Aquabyssos's elite, providing the perfect cover for her intelligence operations. ## Current Activities As political tensions escalate, Madame Whisper finds herself busier than ever. All factions seek her services, either to gather intelligence about their rivals or to use her neutral salon as a meeting ground for sensitive negotiations. She's carefully maintaining her neutral stance while secretly working to prevent the conflicts from escalating to violence. She's also investigating reports of outside interference in Aquabyssos's political affairs, as her information network has detected patterns suggesting external manipulation of the current crisis. ## Quest Hooks

1. Madame Whisper approaches the party with information about a threat to the city, requiring their services in exchange for her intelligence.
2. The party needs access to high society or sensitive information, leading them to negotiate with Madame Whisper for her assistance.
3. Someone feededing false information into Madame Whisper's network, and she needs trustworthy investigators to identify the source. ## DM Notes

Madame Whisper serves as an excellent source of information and social connections while maintaining neutrality that makes her useful to any party regardless of their factional allegiances. Her salon can serve as a safe meeting ground and her information network can advance or complicate plots as needed. Use her sophisticated approach to espionage to contrast with cruder spy operations in the campaign. ## Player-Facing Summary Madame Whisper is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Madame Whisper as a nexus where past and present converge.
