|------------|-----------|
| 1 | An ancient dragon is scheming to destroy a god and take the god's place in the pantheon. The dragon's minions are searching for Artifacts that can summon and weaken this god. |
| 2 | A band of giants drove away a metallic dragon and took over the dragon's lair, and the dragon wants to reclaim the lair. |
| 3 | An ancient hero returns from the dead to prepare the world for the return of an equally ancient monster. |
| 4 | An ancient Artifact has the power to defeat or imprison a rampaging titan. |
| 5 | A god of agriculture is angry, causing rivers to dry up and crops to wither. |
| 6 | An Artifact belonging to a god falls into mortal hands. |
| 7 | A titan imprisoned in the Underdark begins to break free, causing terrible earthquakes that are only a hint of the destruction that the titan will cause if it is released. |
| 8 | A lich tries to exterminate any spellcasters that approach the lich's level of power. |
| 9 | A holy temple was built around a portal leading to one of the Lower Planes to prevent any evil from passing through in either direction. Now the temple has come under siege from both directions. |
| 10 | Five ancient metallic dragons lair in the Pillars of Creation. If all these dragons are killed, the world will collapse into chaos. One has just been slain. |
