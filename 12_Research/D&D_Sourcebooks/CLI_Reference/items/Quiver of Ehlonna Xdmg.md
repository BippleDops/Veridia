# Quiver of Ehlonna
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/quiver-of-ehlonna.webp#right)

- **Weight**: 2.0 lbs.

Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to 60 [[lightning-arrow-xphb (spells)]], [[witch-bolt-xphb (spells)]], or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to 18 [[javelin-xphb (items)]] or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to 6 long objects, such as bows, [[Quarterstaff Xphb]], or [[Eldritch Spear Xphb]].

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.
