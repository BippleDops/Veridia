# The Deepwatch Guard
*Elite Sentinels Against the Darkness Below*

## Overview
The Deepwatch Guard serves as Aquabyssos's most specialized military unit, trained specifically to combat shadow corruption, deep-sea aberrations, and threats that emerge from the darkest depths of the realm. Unlike the regular [[The Depth Wardens]], who focus on general military defense, the Deepwatch Guard specializes in enemies that conventional forces cannot effectively engageâ€”creatures of living shadow, manifestations of [[The Deep Mother]]'s influence, and horrors that defy normal military tactics. They represent the last line of defense against threats that could corrupt or destroy civilization from within.
