# Staff of the Forgotten One
*Staff, artifact (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*  

- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 B
  - Two-handed: 1d8 B
- **Properties**: [Versatile](/rules/item-properties.md#Versatile), [Requires Attunement](/rules/item-properties.md#Requires%20Attunement)
- **Cost**: ‚è§
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This crooked staff is carved from bone and topped with the skull of a forgotten [archmage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md) whom [Acererak](/compendium/bestiary/npc/acererak-toa.md) destroyed long ago. Etched into the skull's forehead is [Acererak's](/compendium/bestiary/npc/acererak-toa.md) rune, which is known on many worlds as a sign of death.

## Beneficial Properties

While the staff is on your person, you gain the following benefits:

- Your proficiency bonus to Intelligence ([Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana)) and Intelligence ([History](/rules/skills.md#History)) checks is doubled.
- You can't be [blinded](/rules/conditions.md#blinded), [charmed](/rules/conditions.md#charmed), [deafened](/rules/conditions.md#deafened), [frightened](/rules/conditions.md#frightened), [petrified](/rules/conditions.md#petrified), or [stunned](/rules/conditions.md#stunned).
- Undead with a challenge rating of 2 or lower will neither threaten nor attack you unless you harm them.
- You can wield the staff as a +3 quarterstaff that deals an extra 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a hit.

## Invoke Curse

The Staff of the Forgotten One has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and target one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (using your spell save DC) or be cursed. While cursed in this way, the target can't regain hit points and has vulnerability to necrotic damage. A [greater restoration](/compendium/spells/greater-restoration.md), [remove curse](/compendium/spells/remove-curse.md), or similar spell ends the curse on the target.

## The Forgotten One

The bodiless life force of a dead [archmage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md) empowers the staff and is imprisoned within it. The rune carved into the staff's skull protects [Acererak](/compendium/bestiary/npc/acererak-toa.md) from this spirit's vengeance. Each time a creature other than [Acererak](/compendium/bestiary/npc/acererak-toa.md) expends any of the staff's charges, there is a 50% chance chance that the life force tries to possess the staff wielder. The wielder must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or be possessed, becoming an NPC under the DM's control. If the intruding life force is targeted by magic such as a [dispel evil and good](/compendium/spells/dispel-evil-and-good.md) spell, it becomes trapped in the staff once more. Once it takes control of another creature, the insane spirit of the dead [archmage](/compendium/bestiary/humanoid/archmage.md) attempts to destroy the staff.

## Destroying the Staff

A creature in possession of the staff can use an action to break it over one knee or a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 132 (24d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. When the staff is destroyed, the life force of the Forgotten One is released to the afterlife. Where it goes is anyone's guess.
