--- # Guild Artisan

*Source: Player's Handbook p. 132* - **Skill Proficiencies.** [[skills#Insight|Insight, [skills#Persuasion|Persuasion]] - **Tool Proficiencies.** One type of artisan's tools - **Languages.** One of your choice - **Equipment.** A set of artisan's tools (one of your choice), a letter of introduction from your guild, a set of [[travelers-clothes-xphb (items), and a belt [component-pouch-xphb (items)]] containing 15 gp You are a member of an artisan's guild, skilled in a particular field and closely associated with other artisans. You are a well-established part of the mercantile world, freed by talent and wealth from the constraints of a feudal social order. You learned your skills as an apprentice to a master artisan, under the sponsorship of your guild, until you became a master in your own right. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Feature: Guild Membership As an established and respected member of a guild, you can rely on certain benefits that membership provides. Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if needed. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central place to meet other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or hirelings. Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers. You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces. ## Specialty Guilds are generally found in cities large enough to support several artisans practicing the same trade. However, your guild might instead be a loose network of artisans who each work in a different village within a larger realm. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your guild. You can select your guild business from the Guild Business table or roll randomly.`dice: [](guild-artisan.md#^guild-business)`| dice: d20 | Guild Business |

^guild-business ## Suggested Characteristics Guild artisans are among the most ordinary people in the worldâ€”until they set down their tools and take up an adventuring career. They understand the value of hard work and the importance of community, but they're vulnerable to sins of greed and covetousness.`dice: [](guild-artisan.md#^personality-trait)`| dice: d8 | Personality Trait |

|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | I believe that anything worth doing is worth doing right. I can't help itâ€”I'm a perfectionist. |
| 2 | I'm a snob who looks down on those who can't appreciate fine art. |
| 3 | I always want to know how things work and what makes people tick. |
| 4 | I'm full of witty aphorisms and have a proverb for every occasion. |
| 5 | I'm rude to people who lack my commitment to hard work and fair play. |
| 6 | I like to talk at length about my profession. |
| 7 | I don't part with my money easily and will haggle tirelessly to get the best deal possible. |
| 8 | I'm well known for my work, and I want to make sure everyone appreciates it. I'm always taken aback when people haven't heard of me. |

^personality-trait`dice: [](guild-artisan.md#^ideal)`| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | Community. It is the duty of all civilized people to strengthen the bonds of community and the security of civilization. (Lawful) |
| 2 | Generosity. My talents were given to me so that I could use them to benefit the world. (Good) |
| 3 | Freedom. Everyone should be free to pursue his or her own livelihood. (Chaotic) |
| 4 | Greed. I'm only in it for the money. (Evil) |
| 5 | People. I'm committed to the people I care about, not to ideals. (Neutral) |

|----------|------|
| 1 | The workshop where I learned my trade is the most important place in the world to me. |

| 3 | I owe my guild a great debt for forging me into the person I am today. |
| 4 | I pursue wealth to secure someone's love. |
| 5 | One day I will return to my guild and prove that I am the greatest artisan of them all. |
| 6 | I will get revenge on the evil forces that destroyed my place of business and ruined my livelihood. |

^bond`dice: [](guild-artisan.md#^flaw)`| dice: d6 | Flaw |

^flaw ## Player-Facing Summary Guild artisan is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of guild artisan as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around guild artisan. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Shadow Alliance - Control trade routes ## Plot Hooks - Someone is hunting an heir for love
