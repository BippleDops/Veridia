--- ### IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY SIGNALS **Code Pressure Red:** Rapid ascent emergency

- **Signal:** Three long horn blasts
- **Action:** Stop all movement, begin emergency surfacing
- **Time limit:** 10 minutes maximum **Code Pressure Blue:** Depth sickness detected
- **Signal:** Pulsing blue crystal light
- **Action:** Find nearest pressure station
- **Priority:** Medical attention within 5 minutes ### Depth Sickness Symptoms **Stage 1 (Mild):**

- Ear pressure, mild dizziness
- Slightly blurred vision
- **Treatment:** Slow ascent, controlled breathing **Stage 2 (Moderate):**
- Severe ear pain, nosebleeds
- Disorientation, nausea
- **Treatment:** Immediate pressure station, medical consultation **Stage 3 (Severe):**
- Joint pain, skin mottling
- Breathing difficulty, confusion
- **Treatment:** Emergency surfacing, immediate medical intervention **Stage 4 (Critical):**
- Paralysis, consciousness loss
- Internal bleeding indicators
- **Treatment:** Emergency rescue, intensive care ### Emergency Equipment Locations **Personal Gear (Always Carry):**

- Pressure regulation crystal (neck worn)
- Emergency air bladder (belt mounted)
- Depth gauge and timer
- Emergency communication shell **Station Equipment:**
- Rapid ascent chambers (every 100 fathoms)
- Medical pressure pods (major hubs)
- Emergency breathing apparatus
- Communication relay crystals #### Rapid Ascent Protocol

1. Activate emergency crystal (three sharp taps)
2. Signal companions with hand gestures
3. Begin controlled ascent (no faster than 50 fathoms/minute)
4. Monitor pressure gauge continuously
5. Stop at safety stations if available
6. Surface breathing: slow, controlled, deep #### Buddy System Emergency

1. Never descend alone below 200 fathoms
2. Check partner's pressure gauge every 15 minutes
3. Learn emergency hand signals
4. Establish check-in schedule
5. Know location of nearest medical station ### Communication Signals **Hand Signals:**

- Fist to chest: "I'm okay"
- Flat hand waving: "Problem, need attention"
- Pointing up: "Need to ascend"
- Pointing down: "Going deeper"
- Crossed arms: "Emergency, help needed" **Crystal Signals:**
- Steady glow: Normal operation
- Slow pulse: Minor concern
- Fast pulse: Urgent attention needed
- Flashing: Emergency situation ### Emergency Contacts - **Depth Emergency Services:** Crystal frequency 7-7-7

- **Medical Emergency:** Crystal frequency 9-1-1
- **Coast Guard Equivalent:** Deep Current Patrol, frequency 5-5-5
- **Tourist Emergency Line:** Crystal frequency 4-1-1 *Remember: Your safety depends on preparation and communication*

*When in doubt, ascend slowly and seek help* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*
