## Special Traits
**Touch. Melee Weapon Attack:** +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: `dice: 1d6+3` fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire , the target takes `dice: 1d6` fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

**Intensify:** As an action, a Tiny, Small, Medium, or [[Elemental, Ragefire (Large)|Large ragefire elemental]] incinerates the corpse of a humanoid it killed within the last minute and whose space the elemental occupies. The elemental heals 5 hit points and, if it is Tiny, it becomes a Small ragefire elemental with full hit points minus its current amount of damage. Likewise, a Small, Medium, or [[Elemental, Ragefire (Large)|Large ragefire elemental]] grows to the next size after incinerating a number of humanoid corpses equal to its current challenge rating.

## Actions
**Multiattack.** The elemental makes two touch attacks.

**Fire Form.** The elemental can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing. A creature that touches the elemental or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes `dice: 1d6+3` fire damage. In addition, the elemental can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. The first time it enters a creature's space on a turn, that creature takes `dice: 1d6+3` fire damage and catches fire; unti someone takes an action to douse the fire, the creature takes `dice: 1d6+3` fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

**Illumination.** The elemental sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light in an additional 30 feet.

**Water Susceptibility.** For every 5 feet the elemental moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on it, it takes 1 cold damage.

## Description
The ragefire elemental is a type of fire elemental that grows as it consumes fuel. All ragefire elementals start out as Tiny sparks, called ragefire spawn. As they burn their way through their surroundings, they steadily increase in size until they become gargantuan infernos.

Ragefire elementals embody the chaos and evil of their Abyssal heritage, manifesting in demonic forms of living flame, smoke, ash, and cinders. They exist to incinerate life and, in so doing, grow stronger and more destructive.

A ragefire elemental cannot enter water or any other nonflammable liquid. A body of water is an impassible barrier unless the ragefire elemental can step or jump over it or the water is covered with a layer of something flammable, such as oil.
