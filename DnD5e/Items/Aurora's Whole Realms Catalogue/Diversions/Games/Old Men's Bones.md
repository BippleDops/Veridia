## Description
The classic game of [[Pick|pick]]-up sticks made with needle-like slivers of dragons, wyverns, and other fell creatures. Remove the bones from the pile but be careful not to topple the stack! Originally from Phlan and the Moonsea area, our diviners attest that no sentient humanoid bones are in the shipment. Stored in a [[Metal|metal]] tube for easy storage and available at the low cost of 2 sp. A special version made exclusively of dragon bones is available at 4 gp.
