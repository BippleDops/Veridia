## Session Summary
The Silverscale Consortium's flagship explodes in the harbor, raining crystallized gold across the merchant quarter. As the party races against the Crimson Hand to secure ancient documents, Marina reveals her true heritage as an Aquabyssos descendant. The confrontation with Vex Shadowthorn unveils deeper conspiracies while Director Silverscale offers a devil's bargain.

## Strong Start
> *Read aloud:* "The morning sky turns goldâ€”not from sunrise, but from the Silverscale flagship 'Golden Promise' exploding in a shower of crystallized wealth. As fragments of transformed gold rain down, you spot Vex Shadowthorn directing Crimson Hand operatives with surgical precision. Marina appears at your shoulder, her usual swagger gone: 'That ship was carrying something that wasn't supposed to existâ€”something from below. We need to talk, NOW.'"

### Location: [[Silverscale Banking House]]
**Read Aloud:** *The banking house's magical security screams warnings as Crimson Hand operatives breach the emergency vault. Crystallized gold from the explosion has somehow disrupted the ward patterns.*

### Skill Challenge: Vault Heist
**Success Threshold**: 4 successes before 3 failures
- Each success: Recover one crucial document
- Each failure: Crimson Hand gets closer to their goal
- Critical Success: Find secret compartment with [[Aquabyssos Trade Seal]]
- Critical Failure: Trigger lockdown, trapped for 10 minutes

### Location: [[Hidden Smuggler's Cove]]
**Atmosphere**: Bioluminescent algae provides eerie blue-green light. Ancient stone architecture predates Port Meridian. Sound of impossible tides.

### Critical Information Revealed
1. The Seven Shards were separators, not containers
2. Aquabyssos exists parallel to Aethermoor
3. The crystal plague is adaptation forcing
4. Marina's bloodline can navigate between worlds
5. The Consortium has been looting Aquabyssos ruins for generations

### The Depth Guard's Map
Marina reveals a map showing:
- Seven lighthouse locations (dimensional weak points)
- Aquabyssos major cities' positions relative to Aethermoor
- Dates of "barrier thinning" events
- Location of the "First Seal" beneath Port Meridian

### Crimson Hand Attack
**Mid-conversation Interrupt**: Crimson Hand strikes the meeting
- 1 Strike Team Leader (Veteran stats + spellcasting)
- 4 Operatives (CR 3 each)
- Environmental hazard: Collapsing sea cave
- Marina reveals water magic abilities

### Location: [[Silverscale Emergency Bunker]]
**Security**: Antimagic field, construct guardians, escape tunnel to ships

### The Devil's Bargain
**Options Presented**:
1. **Take the Money**: Gain wealth, lose Marina's trust, Consortium escapes
2. **Expose the Truth**: Gain allies, make powerful enemies, economic chaos
3. **Negotiate Middle Ground**: Partial disclosure, shared resources, tentative alliance
4. **Forceful Takeover**: Combat option, seize Consortium resources

### Location: [[Abandoned Consortium Warehouse]]
**Setup**: Following leads into obvious but irresistible ambush

#### Pre-Battle Dialogue
**Vex**: "Marcus never understood. The power wasn't in containing the crystalsâ€”it's in becoming them. Just as those below became the water, we shall become the crystal. Evolution, not infection."

#### Combat Mechanics
**Vex Shadowthorn** (Modified Mage)
- AC 18 (magical protections)
- HP 95
- Speed 30 ft, fly 30 ft (crystalline wings)

**Legendary Actions** (1/round):
- Misty Step to safety
- Cast a cantrip
- Activate crystal shield (+2 AC until next turn)

**Lair Actions** (Initiative 20):
- Crystal spikes erupt: DEX save DC 15 or 2d6 piercing
- Gravity reversal in 20 ft sphere
- Corrupting pulse: CON save DC 15 or gain 1 corruption

**Special Abilities**:
- Crystal Corruption Aura: 10 ft, DC 15 CON save or gain exposure
- Shard Channeling: Can cast through nearby crystals
- Emergency Escape: At 0 HP, crystallizes and teleports (once)

### Documents Found
1. Shipping manifests showing underwater excavation equipment
2. Correspondence with "The Deep Traders"
3. Breeding program records (depth adaptation experiments)
4. Ficial records showing massive preparation for "submersion event"
5. Ancient map showing pre-drowning coastlines

### Marina's Gifts
If party chose to help the city over wealth:
- Depth Guard token (advantage on one save vs drowning)
- Teaching of Aquan language basics
- Warning about shadow separation in depths
- Contact information for other Depth Guard members

### Conditional Rewards

- Spellcasting: 3rd level, focus on damage
- Reaction: Shield spell when hit

**Operatives** (4x CR 3)

- Immunity to charm, frightened, poisoned
- Antimagic Pulse (1/day): Dispel magic in 30 ft radius
- Slam: +7 to hit, 2d8+4 bludgeoning

### The Queen's Declaration
> *Read aloud:* "As you emerge from the warehouse, every bell in Port Meridian begins tolling frantically. The normally reclusive Queen Seraphina stands atop the palace, her body half-transformed by purple crystal. Her magically amplified voice echoes across the city:
> 
> 'Citizens of Meridian, the time of transformation is upon us. The surface world has failed. Below us lies paradiseâ€”Aquabyssos, the Drowned Empire, where death itself has drowned. In three days, at the Crystal Festival, we shall all descend together. Those who resist... will sink alone.'
> Guard contingents begin herding confused citizens toward the festival grounds. Marina grabs your arm, her face pale: 'She's found it. The Seventh Shard. And if she uses it at the festival...' She doesn't finish. She doesn't need to."
