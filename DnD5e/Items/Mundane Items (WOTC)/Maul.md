# Maul
**Type**: Mundane Item
**Group**: weapon, martial weapon, melee weapon
**Properties**: 2d6, bludgeoning, - heavy, two-handed
**Weight**: 10 lb.

## Description: 
 Heavy. Creatures that are Small or Tiny have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small or Tiny creature to use effectively. Two-Handed. This weapon requires two hands to use. This property is relevant only when you attack with the weapon, not when you simply hold it.
