## Special Traits
**Leng Venom:** A Leng spider's venom causes flesh to blister and rot, reducing the target's Charisma score by 1 point. It also triggers vivid and horrific hallucinations. A poisoned creature suffers the effect of the poisoned condition and must act as if affected by the confusion spell. The confusion effect ends the second time the creature rolls a 9 or 10 at the start of its turn (allowing it to act normally that turn). The poisoned condition persists until after the creature's next long rest, or until the poison is neutralized magically. Lost Charisma can be regained through magic.

**Spell-like Abilities:** A Leng-spider can use the following spelllike abilities, using Intelligence as its casting ability (DC 16, attack +8). The Leng-spider doesn’t need material components to use these abilities. It can cast dispel magic as a bonus action.

- At Will: *dispel magic*

- 3/day: *invisibility, phantasmal force 1/day: dominate monster*

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A Leng-spider bites once and attacks once with web flails.

**Web Flails:** *Melee Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (`dice: 2d10+3`) bludgeoning damage.
