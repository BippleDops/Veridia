## Overview

Thornwhisper Manor stands as a haunting monument to desperate love and temporal magic gone wrong. Once the grand estate of [[Lady Vivienne Thornwhisper, this magnificent underwater mansion exists in a state of temporal suspension, caught between moments when the lady attempted to save her family from the encroaching corruption. Now known as "The Unfrozen Estate," it serves as both a treasure trove of pre-corruption artifacts and a deadly maze of temporal anomalies.

## Physical Description

The manor is a sprawling complex of interconnected coral towers and kelp gardens, all suspended in shimmering bubbles of frozen time. The architecture represents the height of pre-corruption [Aquabyssos]] nobility:

### [[Lady Vivienne Thornwhisper - "The Unfrozen"
*Medium humanoid (elf), chaotic neutral*
**AS** 18 (Natural Armor) **HP** 200 **Speed** 30 ft., swim 30 ft., fly 60 ft.
**STR** 12 **DEX** 18 **CON** 16 **INT** 22 **WIS** 14 **CHA** 20

A tragic figure who appears as multiple versions of herself from different time periods. Her attempts to master temporal magic to save her family have left her fractured across time.

**Spellcasting**: 18th-level wizard, spell save **DC 19**, +11 spell attack
**Legendary Actions (3 per turn)**:
- **Time Step**: Teleport to any location she can see
- **Temporal Wound**: Target ages `dice: 1d10` years or becomes younger by `dice: 1d10` years
- **Reset**: Undo the last action taken by any creature within 60 feet

**Special Abilities:**
- **Temporal Immunity**: Cannot be affected by time-based spells or effects
- **Chrono-Vision**: Can see all possible timelines simultaneously
- **Unstuck in Time**: Exists in multiple time periods at once

#### [Lord Aldric Thornwhisper]] (Deceased/Frozen)
The lady's husband, preserved at the moment of his death from corruption. Sometimes speaks prophetic warnings when the temporal fields fluctuate.

#### [[Marcus Thornwhisper (Son, Age 12)
Caught in an eternal loop of playing with his toys. Occasionally becomes aware of his situation and begs for release.

#### [Elena Thornwhisper]] (Daughter, Age 16)  
Frozen while reading a book of poetry. Her tears of crystal that fall continuously have magical properties.

#### [[Jeeves (Butler)
An elderly human who maintains the manor despite being temporally displaced. Exists in multiple time periods simultaneously and remembers everything.

### Temporal Echoes
Ghostly impressions of past events that play out repeatedly:
- **The Corruption's Arrival**: Shadowy figures spreading darkness through the estate
- **The Last Dance**: Guests celebrating, unaware of approaching doom  
- **The Ritual**: Lady Vivienne's desperate attempt to freeze time

### The Temporal Field
The entire estate exists within overlapping temporal effects:
- **Time Dilation**: Some rooms experience time slower or faster than normal
- **Temporal Loops**: Certain areas repeat the same moments endlessly
- **Chronological Instability**: Past, present, and future blend together
- **Memory Stones**: Crystals that record and replay past events

### Temporal Anomalies
The manor is riddled with dangerous time effects:

### The Unsealed Corruption
In areas where temporal protection has failed:
- **Shadow Tendrils**: `dice: 1d6` necrotic damage to creatures entering affected areas
- **Corruption Whispers**: **DC 16** Wisdom save or be charmed by shadowy voices
- **Temporal Rot**: Equipment ages and degrades rapidly (10% chance per hour of losing 1 point of AS or weapon damage)

### Lady Vivienne's Study
Hidden behind multiple temporal locks:
- **Chronos Codex**: Spellbook containing unique temporal magic (5 spells of 6th-9th level)
- **Temporal Anchor**: Staff that stabilizes time effects in 30-foot radius
- **Crystal of Preserved Moments**: Stores any single moment in time permanently
- **Time Lord's Crown**: Allows wearer to cast time stop once per day

### The Family Vault
Beneath the manor, protected by ancient wards:
- **Pre-Corruption Artifacts**: Items from [Aquabyssos]]' golden age worth 5,000 gp
- **Thornwhisper Heirlooms**: Noble regalia with protective enchantments
- **Emergency Reserves**: 2,000 platinum pieces, potions of longevity (x3)
- **Secret Documents**: Evidence of the corruption's true origin

### The Frozen Garden
Rare plants suspended in time:
- **Eternal Roses**: Never wilt, grant temporary immunity to aging effects
- **Time Lilies**: Seeds that grow into the past when planted (`dice: 1d4` appear in previous locations visited)
- **Crystal Fruit**: Eating one allows the consumer to see 10 minutes into the future
- **Memory Moss**: Absorbs and replays conversations that occurred nearby

### Temporal Residue
Throughout the manor:
- **Chrono-dust**: Valuable component for time magic spells (50 gp per ounce)
- **Moment Shards**: Crystallized time fragments that can slow or speed effects
- **Echo Pearls**: Contain recorded memories and conversations
- **Temporal Ink**: Written words appear and disappear from different time periods

### Ground Floor
1. **Grand Entrance**: Frozen chandelier eternally falling and reforming
2. **Ballroom**: 30 guests frozen mid-dance, orchestra plays the same measure forever
3. **Dining Hall**: Feast laid out but food exists in multiple states of decay simultaneously  
4. **Kitchen**: Chef repeating the same recipe preparation in 5-minute loops
5. **Servant's Hall**: Staff frozen in their daily duties

7. **Children's Rooms**: Marcus and Elena in their suspended states
8. **Guest Chambers**: Visitors caught unaware by the temporal freeze
9. **Study**: Lady Vivienne's magical research and temporal experiments
10. **Observatory**: Telescope shows different time periods in each realm

18. **Secret Passages**: Network of tunnels with varying time flows

### The Temporal Cure
[[Lady Vivienne Thornwhisper believes she can reverse the corruption using temporal magic, but needs the party to retrieve the [Heart of Chronos]] from the [[Time Gardens of Aethermoor. She offers temporal magic knowledge in exchange.
**Reward**: Unique temporal spells + Temporal Anchor staff

### The Family's Release
The lady's family begs for freedom from their temporal prison, but releasing them might allow corruption to finish claiming them. The party must find a way to break the time lock safely while preserving their lives.
**Reward**: 1,500 gp + grateful noble family's influence

### The Corruption's Origin
Documents in the manor suggest the corruption began with a specific ritual performed by [The Corrupted Admiralty]]. Lady Vivienne needs the party to investigate and potentially travel back in time to prevent it.
**Reward**: 2,000 gp + ability to alter one past event

### The Temporal Artifact
A powerful artifact called the [[Crown of Endless Moments is hidden somewhere in the manor's temporal maze. Multiple factions seek it for different purposes. The party must navigate the hazards and compete with other treasure hunters.
**Reward**: Major magical artifact + elimination of rival faction

### The Memory Thief
Someone is stealing specific memories from the manor's temporal echoes, weakening the time barriers and allowing corruption to seep in. The party must identify and stop the thief before the manor's protection fails completely.
**Reward**: 800 gp + preserved memories containing vital intelligence
