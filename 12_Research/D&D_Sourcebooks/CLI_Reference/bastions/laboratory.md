--- # Laboratory

*Level 9 Bastion facility* - **Prerequisites**: None
- **Space**: Roomy (16 sq)
- **Hirelings**: 1
- **Order**: craft A Laboratory contains storage space for alchemical supplies and workspaces for crafting various concoctions. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Craft Options When you issue the "Craft" order to this facility, choose one of the following options: - **Craft.** Alchemist's Supplies. The facility's hireling crafts anything that can be made with [[Alchemists Supplies Xphb]] using the rules in the "Player's Handbook" and "chapter 7" of this book. - **Craft.** Poison. You commission the facility's hireling to craft a vial containing one application of a poison. The poison must be one of the following: [[Burnt Othur Fumes Xdmg]], [[Essence of Ether Xdmg]], or [[Torpor Xdmg]]. This work takes 7 days, and you must pay half the poison's cost. See ""Poison"" in "chapter 3" for descriptions and costs of poisons. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 342* ## Player-Facing Summary Laboratory is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of laboratory as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around laboratory. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Alliance - Manipulate succession ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[Pressure Adaptation System]]
