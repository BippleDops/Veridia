# Music of the Spheres (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (30-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (three ribbons, one, four, and nine inches long that made from fine silver thread and worth 100 gp each)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


## Effects
Utterly beautiful cosmic music begins playing around you. All creatures within range become so distracted by the music and must make a Wisdom saving throw or be at disadvantage on all attacks against you, and at all attempts to resist any affect that would charm them.
