# Banishing Smite
*5th-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The target hit by the attack roll takes an extra `5d10` Force damage from the attack. If the attack reduces the target to 50 [Hit Points](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or fewer, the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be transported to a harmless demiplane for the duration. While there, the target has the [Incapacitated](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Incapacitated) condition. When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

**Classes**: [Warlock (The Hexblade)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-the-hexblade-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Paladin](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md)
