--- # Afterword

*Source: Out of the Abyss, p. 250* > [!note] > > In the Rage of Demons story, demon lords invade the Underdark and spread madness throughout the subterranean realm. (As if the Underdark wasn't dangerous enough already!) The Underdark is home to some of the D&D game's most iconic monsters, as well as cultures both alien and wondrous.

> To bring the Underdark to life, Richard Whitters and his concept artists created amazing imagery tied to various Underdark races: kuo-toa waymarkers, illithid "brain urns" and domiciles, duergar architecture, drow costuming, and much, much more. Their concept art was featured a "story bible" that we gave to our licensed partners. That story bible served as inspiration for miniatures, digital projects, and print products like the adventure you hold in your hands.
> This appendix contains a sampling of the concept art we commissioned for the Rage of Demons story. We hope that this art further inspires you to run Out of the Abyss or create your own Underdark encounters.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of 22 afterword as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around 22 afterword. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Strange sightings suggest ancient magic
