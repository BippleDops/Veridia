*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 23. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* Some awakened trees stand in still, meditative states for long periods, making them easy to mistake for normal plants, while others patrol regions of natural power. Awakened trees are sometimes brought to life by influences from the Feywild, which make them colorful and endlessly blooming, or by Shadowfell energy, which covers them with grotesque burls or makes them look lifeless. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Awakened Plants *Vegetation Given Magical Life* - **Habitat.** Forest - **Treasure.** None Magic can invest plants with mobility, sapience, and even a voice. Spells such as [[Awaken Xphb]] or the influence of other planes of existence might bring mundane vegetation to life, while other remarkable plants might naturally have these features. > [!quote] A quote from Rivergleam, Pixie > > Just because we protect the forest doesn't mean it's defenseless.```statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of awakened tree xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around awakened tree xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Hidden Prophecy of Depths ## Plot Hooks - A merchant needs help stealing before the new moon
