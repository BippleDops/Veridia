# Pole
*Adventuring gear*  


- **Cost**: 5 cp
- **Weight**: 7.0 lbs.

A Pole is 10 feet long. You can use it to touch something up to 10 feet away. If you must make a Strength ([Athletics](/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills.md#Athletics)) check as part of a High or [Long Jump](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/long-jump-xphb.md), you can use the Pole to vault, giving yourself [Advantage](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on the check.
