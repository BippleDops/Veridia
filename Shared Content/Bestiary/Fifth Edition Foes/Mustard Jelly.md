## Special Traits
**Blind:** A mustard jelly has no eyes, so it is immune to effects that depend on sight such as illusions or gaze attacks.

**Divide:** As an action, a mustard jelly with more than 10 hit points can split itself into two identical jellies, each with half of the original's current hit points (rounded down). For the first minute (10 rounds) after dividing, the newly divided jellies have speed 40 feet.

**Energy Absorption:** When a mustard jelly is targeted by a magic missile spell or when it would take lightning damage, it takes no damage but instead gains temporary hit points equal to the damage the attack should have caused.

**Poison Aura:** A mustard jelly exudes a poisonous vapor. Every creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of a mustard jelly must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be restrained for as long as it remains within 10 feet of any mustard jelly and for `dice: 1d4` rounds afterward. This is a poison effect, not physical restraint.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A mustard jelly makes one slam attack, plus up to five constriction attacks against grappled creatures.

**Slam:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (`dice: 2d6+2`) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (`dice: 1d6`) acid damage and the target must make a successful DC 13 Strength saving throw or be grappled. A mustard jelly can have up to five creatures grappled at once and still make slam attacks; it can grapple a sixth creature, but it can't make slam attacks while it has six creatures grappled.

**Constrict:** *Melee Attack:* automatic hit, one creature already grappled by the mustard jelly at the start of the jelly's turn. Hit: 9 (`dice: 2d6+2`) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (`dice: 1d10`) acid damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate marshes

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
Mustard jelly appears to be a yellowish-brown form of the ochre jelly, and it’s thought to be a distant relative of that creature. The mustard jelly, however, is more dangerous than its supposed relative, thanks to its intelligence. Though it possesses intelligence, a mustard jelly can’t speak. They seem to have no inherent means of communication, but they do respond when contacted telepathically or with magic. Their intelligence is quite alien to that of most humanoids, but those who’ve “conversed” with mustard jellies say they have a surprisingly robust sense of humor.

The mustard jelly gives off a faint odor similar to that of the mustard plant, detectable to a range of 20 feet.

It attacks by forming a pseudopod from its body and either bashing or enveloping its foes. Mustard jellies prefer to attack from ambush, or at least in a situation where they have the upper hand. If combat goes against a mustard jelly, it does not hesitate to flee—after dividing to gain the speed bonus. They have also been known to feign a panicky retreat to lure overconfident or rash foes into prepared traps.
