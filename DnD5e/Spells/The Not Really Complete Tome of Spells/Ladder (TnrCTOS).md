# Ladder (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *1st-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a knot of wood)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


## Effects
You create a ladder of magical force that is one foot wide and ten feet long. You may place it vertically against a wall, lay it horizontally so it can be used to cross gaps, or have it lean at a 45Â° angle to be used as a staircase. In any case, the ladder is firmly anchored and will not move once placed.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the ladder increases ten feet in length for each slot level above 1st.
