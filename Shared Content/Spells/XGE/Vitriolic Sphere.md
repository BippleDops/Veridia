# Vitriolic Sphere
You point at a location within range, and a glowing 1-foot-diameter ball of emerald acid streaks there and explodes in a 20-foot-radius sphere. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `dice: 10d4|avg` (10d4) acid damage and another `dice: 5d4|avg` (5d4) acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 4th.
