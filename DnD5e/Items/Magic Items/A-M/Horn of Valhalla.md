## Description

You can use an action to blow this [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items (WOTC)/Horn|horn]]. In response, warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a [[Berserker|berserker]]*.* They return to Valhalla after 1 [[7 - Time|hour]] or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.

Four types of *horn of Valhalla* are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items (WOTC)/Horn|horn]]’s type determines how many [[Berserker|berserkers]] answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Mundane Items (WOTC)/Horn|horn]]’s type or determines it randomly.
