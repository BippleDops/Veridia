## Special Traits
**Bond:** As an action, a nimb bonds itself with a willing or incapacitated humanoid whose square it co-occupies. The nimb takes control of the body if it wins a Charisma contest against the host. The host’s consciousness remains and can communicate telepathically with the nimb, but the nimb controls the body, which gains the nimbated template (see Appendix B). The nimb can sever the bond on its turn (no action required), whereupon it appears in the closest empty square. If a nimb bonds with a host that has reduced Charisma, the nimb can immediately restore the host’s normal Charisma. If the host dies, the bonded nimb is ejected into any empty space within 5 feet. If the nimb has temporary hit points when this happens, it loses those temporary hit points and generates a second nimb in an adjacent space with hit points equal to the temporary hit points.

**Distorted:** A nimb’s internal anatomy varies from individual to individual and seldom makes any biological sense. Critical hits against the creature do a flat +1 damage but don’t roll damage dice twice.

**Incorporeal:** A nimb can move through gaps as small as 1 square inch without penalty. It can also move through solid objects and other creatures as if they were difficult terrain. The nimb takes `dice: 1d10` force damage if it is still inside something solid at the end of its turn.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** Melee Attack—Ectoplasmic Touch: +5 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d6 + 2` necrotic damage, and the target’s Charisma is reduced by 1. In addition, the nimb gains temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage.

## Description
**Environment**: Any (Between)

**Organization**: Solitary

The nimbi are incorporeal creatures from Between that appear as shimmering silhouettes of humanoid forms. They are strongly drawn to other intelligent beings, and step through mirrors and other reflective portals between the dimensions to follow those they feel connected to. Sometimes, a nimb telepathically communicates with its target, attempting to negotiate a bonding. Often, however, their alien mindsets and troubling requirements prove an insurmountable barrier to such discussions, and they resort to force, hoping that an agreement can be made after the bond has formed.
