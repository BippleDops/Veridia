# Shield of the Cavalier
*Armor ([[shield-xphb|shield]]), very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/shield-of-the-cavalier.webp#right)

- **Armor Class**: 2
- **Weight**: 6.0 lbs.

While holding this Shield, you have a +2 bonus to [[armor-class-xphb|Armor Class]]. This bonus is in addition to the Shield's normal bonus to AC.

The Shield has the following additional properties that you can use while holding it.

## Forceful Bash

When you take the [[actions#Attack|Attack]], you can make one of the attack rolls using the Shield against a target within 5 feet of yourself. Apply your [[proficiency-xphb|Proficiency Bonus]] and Strength modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the Shield deals Force damage to the target equal to `2d6 + 2` plus your Strength modifier, and if the target is a creature, you can push it up to 10 feet directly away from yourself. If the creature is your size or smaller, you can also knock it down, giving it the [[conditions#Prone|Prone]] condition.

## Protective Field

As a [[reaction-xphb|Reaction]], when you or an ally you can see within 5 feet of you is targeted by an attack or makes a saving throw against an area of effect, you can use the Shield to create an immobile 5-foot [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] originating from you. When the [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] appears, any creatures or objects not fully contained within it are pushed into the nearest unoccupied spaces outside it. The attack or area of effect that triggered the [[reaction-xphb|Reaction]] has no effect on creatures and objects inside the [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]], which lasts as long as you maintain [[conditions#Concentration|Concentration]], up to 1 minute. Nothing can pass into or out of the [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]]. A creature or object inside the [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] can't be damaged by attacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] damage anything outside it. Once this property is used, it can't be used again until the next dawn.
