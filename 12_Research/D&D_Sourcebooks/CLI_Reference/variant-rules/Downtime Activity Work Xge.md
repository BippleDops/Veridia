## Resources

Performing a job requires one workweek of effort.

## Resolution

To determine how much money a character earns, the character makes an ability check: Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]), Dexterity ([[skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]), Intelligence using a set of tools, Charisma ([[skills#Performance|Performance]]), or Charisma using a [[musical-instrument-xphb|musical instrument]]. Consult the Wages table to see how much money is generated according to the total of the check.
