# Trap #9 - "If At First You Don't Succeed Try Try And Keep On Trying!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> This room is a masterpiece of the trapsters art. It has all the elements of a continuing classic. There is slapstick, Rube Goldberg devices, low comedy, and a continuing punch line. Old Evinrood really had it in for whoever he expected to come along trying to dig him up, I'll give him that.
> 
> The room seems to be 50 feet wide, by 60 feet long, by 10 feet in height. The floor is made up of 5 foot by 5 foot colored tiles in alternating colors of blue and green. The tiles are glazed and shine faintly. They can be seen to be set in the floor separately. (This sort of thing drives delvers nuts, they are convinced that every one will set off some ttap or plummet into space. Every tomb should have tiled floors.)
> 
> There is magic on the far wall. It is faint but can be detected from [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]]. The walls are covered by the usual stucco covered in frescos. Keep in mind that the far waU will be only dimly lighted by a lamp or torches, so the images are indistinct at best.
> 
> The party will eventually enter the room. Regardless of the precautions taken, at a point 30 feet from the far wall the magic will take effect. The magic is in the frescos painted on the far wall. This senses the approach of a party and at a distance of 30 feet triggers the first phase of the trap.
> 
> Behind the wall covered by a thin veneer stucco are ports through which canfire giant crossbows. There are eight poles mounted in the stone and on each at various heights are three largecrossbows,aimedin various directions. (The crossbows are 5 feet across, and by themselves hit with a 7 `dice: D6` [[14 - Actions in Combat (D&D 5e SRD)|attack]]. They have a nominal value of 200 g.p. each.)
> 
> The lowest bank of these, located 2 and 1/2 feet off the gro,und release their [[Crossbow Bolts (20) (D&D 5e SRD)|bolts]] through the plaster andinto the room. Every member of the party has a 20% chance of being hit! (L2). (There are only eight possible hits, so if there are more than eight who fail portion out the damage to the eight who miss by the largest margin.
> 
> The release of the first cross bows triggers the next phase of the trap. The iron door that closed off this room from the [[9 - The Environment (D&D 5e SRD)|falling]] floor trap begins to rise back into place. The stone wall of the secret room to the right of the door drops into the floor. This acts on a geared mechanism lifting the iron door back up, and releases the torrent of water stored in the chamber. This room is only 20 feet wide by 20 feet deep, but it is over 35 feet tall, this will yield enough water to fill both rooms to a depth of 4 feet.
> 
> The entire party will be buffeted about as the torrent of water is released,and the water hitting the far wall has the effect of causing the next bank of [[Crossbow Bolts (20) (D&D 5e SRD)|crossbow bolts]] to fire one minute after the the wall gets wet. This bank of bows are set at 4 and 1/2 feet in height. Any normal human, or human sized characters are in jeopardy, and any of the shoner types will be bobbing about like so many floating pumpkins conveniently exposed. Once again there is a 20% chance of a party member being hit (L2), up to eight as described above.
> 
> In the back of the newly created alcove is a coffin on a pedestal. It is in such a position that lid is 5 feet above the floor and as such 1 foot above the surface of the water. When the lid is opened it releases the wall on the room on the opposite side of [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]] door. There is nothing in the sarcophagus, but note that its lip is above water level: this will become important soon.
> 
> The leaks through the end wall caused by the holes from the first [[Crossbow Bolts (20) (D&D 5e SRD)|bolts]] will have lowered the water level slighd y. This will be compensated for by the water and its inhabitants from the second newly created alcove. This room is only 20 feet by 20 feet by 10 in height but it contains a school of piranha kept in stasis by a magical field until this very moment. Needless to say if any member of the party has open wounds, say from [[Crossbow Bolts (20) (D&D 5e SRD)|crossbow bolts]] for example, the hungry little fish will be more than happy to administer euthanasia. [[14 - Actions in Combat (D&D 5e SRD)|Attack]] value should be high for wounded delvers and those with exposed flesh in large amounts. (Ever notice how female warriors are usually shown wearing two old V.W. hub caps and the bottom half of a wire mesh bikini? This is one of those situations where more is better.) Any delver who is quick of wit, (yes I realize this is a contradiction in terms) will be able to [[8 - Movement (D&D 5e SRD)|jump]] into the sarcophagus and thus buy time to plot out how not to feed the fish. (For my money Evinrood slipped up here. I would have added a bed of nails or better still [[Spear (D&D 5e SRD)|spears]] in a false bottom for just such an ocassion, but I guess dying old [[Archmage (D&D 5e SRD)|archmages]] can't think of everything.)
> 
> Once the fish have been overcome, the party will notice there is another coffin in the back of this adjacent alcove. Once again opening it triggers yet another flight of [[Crossbow Bolts (20) (D&D 5e SRD)|crossbow bolts]]. These are 6 and 1/2 feet above the ground and all aimed in the direction of the left hand coffin. Those in the left alcove will note that the next crossbow volley is aimed so as to concentrate on this alcove. Party members positioned in this alcove have a 30% chance of being hit (L3). Anyone in or near the right fiand alcove will not be menaced at all. Unlike the right hand coffin this one is full of silver ingots making it impossible to [[14 - Actions in Combat (D&D 5e SRD)|hide]] in to escape the projectiles.
> 
> There are 15,000 silver pieces weight of the metal in the coffin (1,500 g.p. value.) A note: after the second flight the party may have decided to "look into" this wall with extreme prejudice. If so the third trap may be thwarted, as the wall is easy enough to bring down. But if the party doesn't dismantle the crossbow [[8 - Traps (D&D 5e SRD)|traps]], but rather goes on and opens the next coffin they will still launch at any attempt to open the left hand coffin.
> 
> The third volley of [[Crossbow Bolts (20) (D&D 5e SRD)|crossbow bolts]] will certainly provoke an assault on the far wall. It is easily broken down with applied force revealing yet another chamber 20 feet deep, as wide as the main room and as high. The sarcophagus in the back of this room is by far the most ornate yet discovered. It is of carved red marble, and rests on the floor. The water laps almost to it's lip. I t is hard to see what the carving consists of but a tactile inspection of the sides reveal the pattern to be perpendicular lines, all the way around from base to the edge that supports the lid. A magic user who is able to [[Detect Magic (D&D 5e SRD)|detect magic]] will be able to tell the party that there is a magical presence in the sarcophagus but it is passive.
> 
> If the lid is lifted there is a thump inside. When it is removed the coffin will appear empty. If any member of the party pokes the bottom, or jumps in it will set off the last trap in this room.
> 
> The sarcophagus contained a [[Elemental, Fire (D&D 5e SRD)|fire elemental]], resting on a false bottom, when the lid is lifted it dumped the [[14 - Monsters (D&D 5e SRD)|elemental]] into the base of the sarcophagus waking it out of the [[The Schools of Magic (D&D 5e SRD)|enchantment]] that contained it. This will also set the false bottom to operate the next part of the trap. When pressure is applied to the false bottom it causes the' panels in all the carved parallel lines on sides to open and water to rush in on the now awakened and angry [[Elemental, Fire (D&D 5e SRD)|fire elemental]]. The [[14 - Monsters (D&D 5e SRD)|elemental]] is tough but this much water will destroy it. The resultant steam explosion should be a thing of beauty! The shrapnel caused by the explosion blowing out the segmented sides of the sarcophagus will be as dangerous as an attack by the elemental itself would have been. Carnage should ensue. Distance from the point of the explosion will mitigate the attack with those at over 20 feet distant being only nominally effected.
> 
> The elemental had an attack valueof `dice: 8D6` so the resultant shrapnel will have the same striking power up to 10 feet from the coffin, at this point it will be halved. The effect will be halved again at 20 feet.
> 
> Given the multiple nature of this trap, and the manifold opportunities for death or disability I rate it a four skuller. After all ... "it keeps going and going, and going ... "
> 
> The resultam explosion will in all likelihood chip enough plaster off the real back wall of this room to reveal the locations of two oew doors.
> 
> If the hapless delvers have not had enough. Press on to the next trap.
