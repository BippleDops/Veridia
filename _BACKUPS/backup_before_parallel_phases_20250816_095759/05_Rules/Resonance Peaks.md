# Resoce Peaks

*The Symphony of Stone and Crystal*

> *"The Peaks do not merely amplify sound—they transform it, reshape it, and give it purpose beyond what nature intended. When properly tuned, these formations can make the ocean itself sing, turning the chaos of the depths into harmony that reaches across dimensions. But like any instrument, they must be played with skill, for a discord at these frequencies can shatter more than stone."*
