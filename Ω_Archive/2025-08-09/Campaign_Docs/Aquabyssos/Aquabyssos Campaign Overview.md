# Aquabyssos: The Drowned Empire
## Campaign Overview

> *"In the depths, even light drowns."*

## üåä The Cataclysm of Tides

Three centuries ago, the surface empire of Thalassopolis triggered the **Cascade of Sorrows** - a magical catastrophe that drowned entire civilizations. This wasn't mere flooding; it was reality's inversion:

- **Year 0**: The Grand Conjunction - Attempt to achieve godhood
- **Years 1-5**: The Tide Wars - Chaotic ocean levels
- **Years 6-20**: The Great Drowning - Systematic submersion
- **Years 21-50**: The Depth Adaptation - Magical transformation
- **Years 51-300**: The Silent Centuries - Isolation and evolution

## üìù Notes

### Design Philosophy
Aquabyssos is designed as a world where heroism means choosing which innocents to save, not saving everyone. The horror comes not from jump scares but from the slow realization that you're changing, that your shadow moves independently, that your memories might not be your own.

### Inspirations
- Bioshock's Rapture
- Sunless Sea's Fallen London
- The Abyss (film)
- Lovecraftian cosmic horror
- The Dark Tower's multiple realities
- Planescape's philosophical questions
