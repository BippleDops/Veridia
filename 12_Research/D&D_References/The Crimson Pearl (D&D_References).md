A hauntingly beautiful sea elf with skin like polished alabaster and eyes that glow crimson in darkness. She drapes herself in strings of blood-red pearls that pulse with an unnatural light. Her movements are too fluid, too graceful, as if she's not quite bound by the same physics as others. ### The Surface Tragedy

Two hundred years ago, Scarlett was a legitimate pearl trader who made regular runs to [[Market District|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Market District]]. During one surface visit, she encountered a vampire lord who saw potential in her ability to move between worlds. He turned her into a spawn, but the transformation went wrong when she returned to water - creating something unique and terrible. ### [[High Tidecaller Nerissa]]

"We dance because neither can afford to stop the music."
- Mutual hostage situation
- Each has dirt on the other
- Occasionally share information
- Would destroy each other if they could ### [[Gareth Ironforge|02 Worldbuilding/People/Gareth Ironforge]]

"The dwarf's gold spends well, and he asks few questions."
- Supplies him with rare deep metals
- He provides surface weapons
- Both know it's dirty but need each other
- Connected through [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]] ### [[Aboleth Prime Yoth]]

"Even I have things I won't deal with. Usually."
- Occasional trades for forbidden knowledge
- Mutual wariness and respect
- Both immortal perspectives
- Share certain ancient secrets ### Whisper Jack

"My best knife - sharp, reliable, and knows when to stay sheathed."
- Complete trust (rare for her)
- Saved each other's lives multiple times
- He knows her true nature
- Genuinely cares for him (weakness) ### Current Plots

1. **The Surface Pipeline:** Building permanent smuggling portals
2. **The Depth War Profiteering:** Selling weapons to all sides
3. **The Restoration Funding:** Secretly supporting chaos for profit
4. **The Vampire Network:** Connecting underwater and surface vampires ## Quest Hooks 1. **[[Blood in the Water]]** - She needs special blood from a surface noble


2. **[[The Pearl Heist]]** - Steal from her or for her
3. **[[Syndicate War]]** - Internal power struggle
4. **[[The Cure]]** - Help her find vampire cure (or ensure she doesn't)
5. **[[Surface Syndicate]]** - Establish criminal network above ## Secrets & Leverage 1. **The Sire:** Her vampire lord still seeks her from surface


2. **The Haven:** Hidden in sunken ship graveyard
3. **The Cure Research:** Has partially succeeded
4. **The Surface Tunnel:** Direct route to [[Market District|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Market District]]
5. **The Pearl Cultivation:** Feeds pearls her blood
6. **The Restoration Funding:** Profits from chaos
7. **The Guard Captain:** Controls harbor security ### Weaknesses


- Vampiric vulnerabilities
- Genuine care for Whisper Jack
- Fear of her sire finding her
- Addiction to power
- Can't leave water for long --- *"In Pearl Harbor, we say the water runs red for a reason."*
