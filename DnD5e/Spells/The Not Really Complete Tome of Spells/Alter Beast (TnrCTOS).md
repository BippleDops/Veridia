## Effects
You may sculpt part of a living being’s body as you wish. For instance, you could change paws into hands, make a quadruped walk upright, enlarge a creature’s brain, and so on. The creature may make a Constitution saving throw to resist. On a success, you make the changes you want. On a failure, you make the changes you want and the creature also takes 3d6 necrotic damage as its body is painfully rearranged.

The changes you make are permanent and might be passed down to any offspring it may have.
