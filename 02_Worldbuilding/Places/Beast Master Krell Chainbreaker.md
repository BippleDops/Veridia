# Beast Master Krell Chainbreaker

*"Every creature has a price, and I know how to make them pay it."*

## Overview
Krell Chainbreaker is a notorious beast master who operates in the outer districts of Aquabyssos, capturing and training dangerous sea creatures for various illegal purposes. His brutal methods and lack of regard for creature welfare have made him feared throughout the criminal underworld.

Once a legitimate marine biologist, Krell's descent into criminality began after losing his research position due to unethical experimentation. Now he uses his expertise to create living weapons and exotic pets for wealthy clients.

**Command Creature.** Commands one tamed beast to attack (beast acts immediately).
**Beast Whistle** (Recharge 5-6). Summons 1d4 trained sea creatures to aid him.

## Background
Formerly Dr. Krell Marineson, he was expelled from the Aquabyssos Research Institute for conducting illegal experiments on sentient sea life. His obsession with creature control led him to develop brutal training methods that break creatures' wills entirely.

Now he operates from hidden facilities in abandoned kelp farms, where the screams of tortured creatures echo through the water. His client list includes assassins, gladiator promoters, and wealthy collectors who want "unique" pets.

## Current Activities
- Training captured shark-spawn for underground fighting rings
- Developing new control methods using pain-inducing neural implants
- Hunting rare deep-sea creatures for wealthy collectors
- Breeding aggressive hybrid creatures in secret facilities

## Beast Companions
**Frenzy** (Dire Shark): His primary enforcer and mount
**The Twins** (Modified Electric Eels): Shock weapons and guards
**Whisper** (Telepathic Octopus): Spy and communication relay
**Pack**: 3-6 various trained sea creatures depending on current jobs

## Relationships
- **The Shadow Market**: Primary client base for exotic creatures
- **Underground Fighting Rings**: Supplies beasts for gladiator matches
- **City Watch**: Wanted for multiple counts of creature abuse
- **Marine Research Institute**: Considers him a dangerous rogue scientist

## Secrets
- Maintains detailed notes on every creature's psychological breaking point
- Has captured several rare creatures thought extinct
- Working on a master project to control a Leviathan
- His laboratory contains evidence of experiments on sentient beings

## Quest Hooks
1. Players hired to rescue captured companion/mount
2. Investigation into missing creatures leads to his facilities
3. He approaches party with offer for rare creature acquisition
4. His escaped experiments threaten local areas

## Services
- Custom creature training (500-5000 gp)
- Exotic creature procurement (price varies)
- Beast handling consultation (50 gp/day)
- Creature modification (highly illegal, 1000+ gp)

## DM Notes
Krell should be portrayed as intelligent but completely amoral. His facilities are horrifying but he sees himself as a scientist. Use him to explore themes of abuse of power and scientific ethics.
