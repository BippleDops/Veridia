# Piwafwi of Fire Resistance
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  

This dark spider silk cloak is made by [[Bestiary]]. It is a [[Cloak of Elvenkind Xdmg]]. It also grants resistance to fire damage while you wear it. It loses its magic if exposed to sunlight for 1 hour without interruption.

While you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) checks made to see you have disadvantage. and you have advantage on Dexterity ([[skills#Stealth|Stealth]]) checks made to hide, as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
