## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The duergar despot's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence. It can cast the following spells, requiring no components:

At Will: *mage hand, minor illusion*
1/day each: *counterspell, misty step, stinking cloud*

***Magic Resistance.*** The duergar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Psychic Engine.*** When the duergar despot suffers a critical hit or is reduced to 0 hit points, psychic energy erupts from its frame to deal 14 ( `dice: 4d6`) psychic damage to each creature within 5 feet of it.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the duergar despot has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The despot makes two iron fist attacks and two stomping foot attacks. It can replace up to four of these attacks with uses of its Flame Jet.

***Iron Fist.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 ( `dice: 2d8+5`) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must make a successful DC 17 Strength saving throw or be thrown up to 30 feet away in a straight line. The target is knocked prone and then takes 10 ( `dice: 3d6`) bludgeoning damage.

***Stomping Foot.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 ( `dice: 1d8+5`) bludgeoning damage, or 18 ( `dice: 3d8+5`) bludgeoning damage to a prone target.

***Flame Jet.*** The duergar spews flames in a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 ( `dice: 4d8`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
