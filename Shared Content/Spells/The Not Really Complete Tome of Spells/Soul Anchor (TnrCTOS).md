# Soul Anchor (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
You tie the target’s life force to a particular building, an estate, or another place with a clearly-defined border, unless the target succeeds at a Wisdom saving throw. While this spell is in effect, the target cannot leave that place unless you or the building’s owner (if that is not also the target) grant permis- sion, or a *dispel magic* or *remove curse* spell is successfully cast on the target.

If the target attempts to leave, the area outside the border becomes difficult terrain, and the target takes 1d10 force damage each time it ends its turn outside the designated place.
