# The Crimson Shard Guardian
*Bound Elemental, Herald of the Blood Plague*

## Overview
Once a pure water elemental summoned to cleanse the harbor, this entity has been corrupted by proximity to the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards|Crimson Shard]] for over a century. Now a twisted guardian of blood and disease, it dwells in the sunken merchant vessel *Fortune's Folly* at the bottom of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]] harbor, spreading crystal plague through the water.

## Description
- **Appearance**: Massive form of churning crimson water mixed with crystalline growths
- **Size**: 20 feet tall when fully manifested
- **Aura**: Waters within 100 feet turn reddish and feel feverish
- **Voice**: Gurgling whispers in Aquan and Primordial, speaks of "the red tide's blessing"

- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/High Priestess Celeste Dawnbringer]]**: Seeks to purify the guardian
- **[[The Dockworkers Union]]**: Losing members to the plague
