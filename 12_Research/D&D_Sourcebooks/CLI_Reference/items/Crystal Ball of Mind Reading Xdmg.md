# Crystal Ball of Mind Reading
*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)*  


- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs.

While touching this crystal orb, you can cast [[scrying-xphb|Scrying]] (save DC 17) with it. In addition, you can cast [[detect-thoughts-xphb|Detect Thoughts]] (save DC 17) targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this [[detect-thoughts-xphb|Detect Thoughts]] spell to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if the [[scrying-xphb|Scrying]] spell ends.
