# Session 4: The Silverscale Gambit

## Session Summary
The Silverscale Consortium's flagship explodes in the harbor, raining crystallized gold across the merchant quarter. As the party races against the Crimson Hand to secure ancient documents, Marina reveals her true heritage as an Aquabyssos descendant. The confrontation with Vex Shadowthorn unveils deeper conspiracies while Director Silverscale offers a devil's bargain.

## Pre-Session Planning

### Key Objectives
- [ ] Reveal Marina's true allegiance
- [ ] Introduce Aquabyssos connection explicitly
- [ ] Confront party with moral choice (wealth vs. duty)
- [ ] First major confrontation with Vex
- [ ] Establish bloodline mystery

### Required Props
- Shard Compass prop/handout
- Map to Aquabyssos (partially visible)
- Consortium contract handout
- Vex's journal pages (if defeated)

## Strong Start
> *Read aloud:* "The morning sky turns gold—not from sunrise, but from the Silverscale flagship 'Golden Promise' exploding in a shower of crystallized wealth. As fragments of transformed gold rain down, you spot Vex Shadowthorn directing Crimson Hand operatives with surgical precision. Marina appears at your shoulder, her usual swagger gone: 'That ship was carrying something that wasn't supposed to exist—something from below. We need to talk, NOW.'"

### Immediate Decisions
- Chase Vex's operatives?
- Investigate explosion site?
- Follow Marina immediately?
- Alert Captain Brightshield?

## Scene 1: The Consortium Vault

### Location: [[Silverscale Banking House]]
**Read Aloud:** *The banking house's magical security screams warnings as Crimson Hand operatives breach the emergency vault. Crystallized gold from the explosion has somehow disrupted the ward patterns.*

### Challenges
- **Magical Security Maze**: Series of skill checks
  - Investigation DC 14 to find true path
  - Arcana DC 15 to disable wards
  - Thieves' Tools DC 16 to bypass physical locks
- **Race Against Time**: Crimson Hand has 5-minute head start
- **Vault Guardian**: Construct that doesn't recognize anyone (systems corrupted)

### Discoveries
- Ancient contract: "Seven Shard Containment Protocol" dated 200 years ago
- Silverscale family tree showing marriages to "Deep Families"
- Map fragments showing underwater excavation sites
- Encoded ledger detailing payments from "The Sunken Markets"

### Skill Challenge: Vault Heist
**Success Threshold**: 4 successes before 3 failures
- Each success: Recover one crucial document
- Each failure: Crimson Hand gets closer to their goal
- Critical Success: Find secret compartment with [[Aquabyssos Trade Seal]]
- Critical Failure: Trigger lockdown, trapped for 10 minutes

## Scene 2: Marina's Revelation

### Location: [[Hidden Smuggler's Cove]]
**Atmosphere**: Bioluminescent algae provides eerie blue-green light. Ancient stone architecture predates Port Meridian. Sound of impossible tides.

### Marina's True Identity
- Full name: Marina Coralheart-Tethys
- Descendant of Aquabyssos nobility who escaped drowning
- Part of the "Depth Guard" - secret organization monitoring the barrier
- Can breathe underwater and sense shard locations
- Has been preventing surface/depth contamination

### Critical Information Revealed
1. The Seven Shards were separators, not containers
2. Aquabyssos exists parallel to Aethermoor
3. The crystal plague is adaptation forcing
4. Marina's bloodline can navigate between worlds
5. The Consortium has been looting Aquabyssos ruins for generations

### The Depth Guard's Map
Marina reveals a map showing:
- Seven lighthouse locations (dimensional weak points)
- Aquabyssos major cities' positions relative to Aethermoor
- Dates of "barrier thinning" events
- Location of the "First Seal" beneath Port Meridian

### Crimson Hand Attack
**Mid-conversation Interrupt**: Crimson Hand strikes the meeting
- 1 Strike Team Leader (Veteran stats + spellcasting)
- 4 Operatives (CR 3 each)
- Environmental hazard: Collapsing sea cave
- Marina reveals water magic abilities

## Scene 3: The Consortium Director

### Location: [[Silverscale Emergency Bunker]]
**Security**: Antimagic field, construct guardians, escape tunnel to ships

### Director Hadrian Silverscale
- Appearance: Impeccably dressed despite chaos, nervous tic in left eye
- Personality: Cold pragmatism masking deep fear
- Knowledge: Full history of Aquabyssos excavations
- Offer: 50,000gp worth of resources to keep quiet
- Threat: Can destroy party's reputation across the kingdom

### The Devil's Bargain
**Options Presented**:
1. **Take the Money**: Gain wealth, lose Marina's trust, Consortium escapes
2. **Expose the Truth**: Gain allies, make powerful enemies, economic chaos
3. **Negotiate Middle Ground**: Partial disclosure, shared resources, tentative alliance
4. **Forceful Takeover**: Combat option, seize Consortium resources

### Silverscale's Revelations
- Shows preserved Aquabyssos artifacts in collection
- Demonstrates working pressure suit from underwater city
- Reveals breeding program to create depth-adapted humans
- Has emergency beacon to summon "deep traders"

### Decision Consequences
- Party's choice affects faction standings dramatically
- Marina judges based on their decision
- Silverscale remembers (enemy or ally)
- Economic ripple effects begin immediately

## Scene 4: Vex's Trap

### Location: [[Abandoned Consortium Warehouse]]
**Setup**: Following leads into obvious but irresistible ambush

### Environmental Details
- Warehouse filled with crystallized cargo
- Purple crystal formations growing from crates
- Reality slightly unstable (minor planar overlap)
- Sounds of dripping water despite no visible source

### Vex Shadowthorn Confrontation

#### Pre-Battle Dialogue
**Vex**: "Marcus never understood. The power wasn't in containing the crystals—it's in becoming them. Just as those below became the water, we shall become the crystal. Evolution, not infection."

#### Revelations During Combat
- Vex was Brother Marcus's star pupil
- Turned to darkness after discovering "the truth below"
- Has been in psychic contact with entity in Aquabyssos
- Believes merger is humanity's only salvation
- Their master isn't the Crimson Hand leadership

#### Combat Mechanics

- AC 18 (magical protections)
- HP 95
- Speed 30 ft, fly 30 ft (crystalline wings)

**Legendary Actions** (1/round):
- Misty Step to safety

**Lair Actions** (Initiative 20):
- Crystal spikes erupt: DEX save DC 15 or 2d6 piercing

**Special Abilities**:
- Crystal Corruption Aura: 10 ft, DC 15 CON save or gain exposure
- Shard Channeling: Can cast through nearby crystals
- Emergency Escape: At 0 HP, crystallizes and teleports (once)

## Discoveries & Clues

2. Correspondence with "The Deep Traders"
3. Breeding program records (depth adaptation experiments)

## Cliffhanger Ending

### The Queen's Declaration
> *Read aloud:* "As you emerge from the warehouse, every bell in Port Meridian begins tolling frantically. The normally reclusive Queen Seraphina stands atop the palace, her body half-transformed by purple crystal. Her magically amplified voice echoes across the city:
> 
> 'Citizens of Meridian, the time of transformation is upon us. The surface world has failed. Below us lies paradise—Aquabyssos, the Drowned Empire, where death itself has drowned. In three days, at the Crystal Festival, we shall all descend together. Those who resist... will sink alone.'
> 
> Guard contingents begin herding confused citizens toward the festival grounds. Marina grabs your arm, her face pale: 'She's found it. The Seventh Shard. And if she uses it at the festival...' She doesn't finish. She doesn't need to."

### Immediate Consequences
