Understanding these goods, their values, and the forces that control their flow provides the key to success in the complex world of cross-realm trade. ## Lore Details Merchant legends speak of the Perfect Inventory, a mythical collection containing one example of every trade good that has ever existed or ever could exist. Some say this cosmic warehouse exists somewhere between the realms, accessible only to those who have achieved perfect understanding of the true nature of value and exchange. Ancient trade records describe goods that seem to violate natural laws: weapons that become sharper with use, textiles that adapt to their wearer's needs, and foods that provide perfect nutrition regardless of quantity. These legendary items reportedly appear in markets during times of great need, but always at prices that test the moral boundaries of those who would purchase them. Deep-sea merchants tell stories of cargo that carries memories of everyone who has ever owned it, allowing skilled traders to read the emotional and historical significance of items simply by handling them. This psychometric commerce supposedly allows for more accurate pricing and authentication, but also creates ethical dilemmas about privacy and the ownership of experiences. ## DM Notes Use the trade goods catalog as more than just a price list - make it a living system that responds to campaign events and drives plot development. Price changes can reflect larger political and economic developments, while the search for specific goods can motivate adventures and character decisions. Consider how the complex web of legitimate and criminal commerce creates moral ambiguity for characters. The same trade route might carry both essential medicines and illegal weapons, forcing characters to make difficult choices about which aspects of commerce to support or oppose. The economic complexity allows for sophisticated plots involving market manipulation, supply chain disruption, and the far-reaching consequences of seemingly simple commercial decisions. Use trade goods as a way to connect distant events and demonstrate how individual character actions can have widespread economic and social impacts. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Second Prophecy of Stars ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
