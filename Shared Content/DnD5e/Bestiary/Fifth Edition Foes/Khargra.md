*This creature resembles a man-sized cylinder covered in metallic scales. It sports three large “fins” spaced even around its circumference. Between each fin is a metal sheath from which slide long, clawlike arms. A large hole in the front of the cylindrical body is lined with many small, inward-curving, metallic teeth; this appears to function as the creature’s mouth.*

## Special Traits
**Earth Glide:** A khargra can glide through stone, dirt, and almost any other sort of earth, including metal, as easily as a fish swims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole and does not create a ripple or other sign of its presence. A move earth spell cast on an area containing a burrowing khargra flings the khargra back 30 feet and stuns the creature for 1 round unless it makes a successful Constitution saving throw.

**Metal Attunement:** A khargra has tactical advantage on attack rolls against targets wearing metal armor (chain shirt or better) or carrying a metal shield.

**Vulnerable to Heat:** A khargra takes maximum damage from a heat metal spell.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A khargra attacks once with claws and bites once.

**Claws:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 5 (`dice: 1d6+2`) piercing damage and the target is grappled. If the target is using a shield, it is not grappled but it must make a successful DC 12 Strength saving throw or the khargra pulls the shield away and drops it.

**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d10+2`) piercing damage, plus 4 (`dice: 1d8`) fire damage if the target is grappled by the khargra.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Elemental Plane of Earth

**Organization**: Solitary or pack (2–5)
