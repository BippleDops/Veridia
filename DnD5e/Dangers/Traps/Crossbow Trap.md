# Crossbow Trap
## Overview
*Simple trap (level 1â€“4, dangerous threat)*
The crossbow trap is a favourite of kobolds and other creatures that rely on traps to defend their lairs. It consists of a trip wire strung across a hallway and connected to a pair of hidden heavy crossbows. The crossbows are aimed to fire down the hallway at anyone who disturbs the trip wire.
#### Trigger.
A creature that walks through the trip wire triggers the trap.
#### Effect.
The trap makes two attacks against the triggering creature. Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, two attacks; Hit: 5 (1d10) piercing damage on a hit. This attack can't gain advantage or disadvantage.
#### Countermeasures.
A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the trip wire. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disables the trip wire, and a check with a total of 5 or lower triggers the trap.
