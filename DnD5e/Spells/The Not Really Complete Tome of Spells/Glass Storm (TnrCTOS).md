# Glass Storm (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *8th-level*

**School**: *conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 minute

**Range**: Self (30-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (a shard of glass)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to one minute


## Effects
You create extremely powerful winds that surround you, leaving you in the storm’s “eye.” The winds are full of dangerous glass and crystal shards.

All creatures within the storm must make a Dexterity saving throw each time that they end their turn in the storm. A creature takes 10d6 piercing damage and is blinded for 1 minute on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage and not be blinded on a successful one.

Ranged combat is impossible within the storm. Non-metallic armor has its AC re-duced by 1 each round it is the storm. Armor that has its AC reduced to 10 is destroyed.
