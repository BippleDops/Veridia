Unlike Adaptation Points (AP) which focus on pressure survival, TP encompasses all forms of physical, mental, and spiritual metamorphosis. **Earning Transformation Points:** | Source | TP Gained | Trigger | Side Effects |

|--------|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Parasite Bond | `dice: 2d6` TP | Accepting symbiont | Loss of autonomy |
| Crystal Exposure | `dice: 1d8` TP | 24 hours near crystals | Reality distortion |
| Deep Mother's Touch | `dice: 3d6` TP | Dream visitation | Prophetic madness |
| Technological Integration | `dice: 2d4` TP | Cybernetic implant | Humanity loss |
| Memory Consumption | `dice: 1d4` TP | Absorbing 10+ memories | Identity crisis |
| Ritual Transformation | 10 TP | Specific ceremonies | Permanent change |
| Environmental Mutation | 1 TP | Weekly exposure | Gradual shift |
| Traumatic Evolution | `dice: 4d6` TP | Near-death experience | Psychological scars | ### Transformation Stages | Stage | TP Required | Reversibility | Description |

|-------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Touched | 1-10 | Easy | Minor cosmetic changes |
| Changed | 11-25 | Moderate | Functional alterations |
| Altered | 26-50 | Difficult | Major physiological shifts |
| Transformed | 51-75 | Near-impossible | Species-level changes |
| Transcendent | 76-100 | Irreversible | Beyond mortal form |
| Apotheosis | 100+ | N/A | Become something else entirely | ### Transformation Resistance **Base Resistance**: 10 + Constitution modifier + Wisdom modifier Roll resistance when exposed to transformation triggers:

1. **The Transformation Plague**: Mass transformation event threatens city
2. **The Perfect Form**: Cult seeks ultimate transformation
3. **The Cure**: Desperate search for reversal method
4. **The Evolved**: Transformed beings form new society
5. **The Hunter**: Someone targets transformed individuals ## Designer Notes This system emphasizes:

- **Body horror**: Physical changes are disturbing
- **Loss of humanity**: Mental changes are profound
- **Player agency**: Choices matter in transformation
- **Irreversibility**: Some changes can't be undone
- **Social impact**: Transformation affects relationships
- **Power at a price**: Every benefit has drawbacks The transformation system should create tension between power and humanity, offering tempting abilities while threatening the character's essential nature. Use it to explore themes of identity, evolution, and what it means to be human in a world where humanity itself is mutable. --- *"In the depths, transformation is not just possible—it's inevitable. The question is not whether you will change, but what you will choose to become."*
- Dr. Erasmus Thorne, Final Research Notes ## Player-Facing Summary Transformation Compendium is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Transformation Compendium as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Transformation Compendium. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology.
