# The Verdant Reach
*The Last Green Heart of Aethermoor*

## Overview
The Verdant Reach encompasses the vast southern forests of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]], the largest remaining area untouched by crystal corruption. Protected by [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Archdruid Thornweaver]] and the [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Verdant Accord]], these ancient woods represent the world as it was before [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Crystallization]]. However, the crystals creep closer each year, and the forest's time may be running out.

## Geography

### The Three Forests
- **The Elderwood**: Ancient trees, some over 1000 years old
- **The Singing Glades**: Where wind through leaves creates music
- **The Darkwood**: Dense canopy, dangerous, full of secrets

### Sacred Sites
- **The Heart Grove**: [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Archdruid Thornweaver]]'s seat of power
- **The Moonwell**: Pool of pure, uncorrupted water
- **The Standing Stones**: Pre-Shattering druid circle
- **The World-Tree**: Hidden, connects to all forests
- **The Green Spire**: Southern crystal formation (contained)

### Settlements
- **[[Sylvanheart]]**: Elven tree-city, population 8,000
- **Oakhollow**: Human/halfling trade town, population 3,000

## Natural Defenses
