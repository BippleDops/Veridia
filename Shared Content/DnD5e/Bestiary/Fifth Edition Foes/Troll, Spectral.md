## Special Traits
**Create Spawn:** A humanoid killed by a spectral troll rises one to three days later as a free-willed specter unless a cleric of the victims religion casts gentle repose or comparable magic on the corpse before it rises.

**Incorporeal:** A spectral troll can move through gaps as small as 1 square inch without penalty. It can also move through solid objects and other creatures as if they were difficult terrain. The spectral troll takes `dice: 1d10` force damage if it is still inside something solid at the end of its turn.

**Rejuvenation:** Unless it is permanently destroyed by having its spirit laid to rest, a destroyed spectral trolls spirit restores itself to unlife in `dice: 2d4` days.

**Silent:** A spectral troll makes no sound whatsoever; it is undetectable by purely audial means.

**Unholy Fortitude:** Spectral trolls are highly resistant to turning. They have tactical advantage on saving throws against being turned.

**Vanish in Sunlight:** A spectral troll that begins its turn in bright sunlight is banished to a remote, unknown dimension. It returns, near the same spot, when that location is no longer in direct sunlight. Only true sunlight has this effect; magical light does nothing.

## Description
Spectral trolls are a unique form of undead. They are the undying spirits of slain trolls whose regenerative ability, for unknown reasons, continues functioning long after the troll’s physical form is utterly destroyed. Such undead creatures are tormented by snatches of memory from their former lives. They detest all living creatures, including other trolls—possibly other trolls more than anything else.

Being undead, spectral trolls can be turned, but not easily.

By nature, they are creatures of darkness. Direct, bright sunlight banishes a spectral troll to an unknown realm. When daylight fades, the spectral troll returns, near the same spot but not necessarily at the exact location.

It’s impossible to destroy a spectral troll through simple combat. Even the most potent spells (wish, true resurrection) offer temporary solutions at best. The spectral troll’s spirit is so powerfully compelled by hatred to regenerate that it restores itself to unlife in `dice: 2d4` days. The only way to destroy a spectral troll permanently is to determine the reason for its existence and set right whatever prevents it from resting in peace or from traveling on to whatever spirit realm would claim it. The exact means for doing this vary with each spirit and usually can be discovered only with extensive research—including long hours of searching and investigating in the obviously dangerous area the spectral troll haunts.
