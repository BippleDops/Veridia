# Produce Flame
*cantrip, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minutes

A flickering flame appears in your hand and remains there for the duration. While there, the flame emits no heat and ignites nothing, and it sheds [[Light Xphb]] in a 20-foot radius and [[Light Xphb]] for an additional 20 feet. The spell ends if you cast it again.

Until the spell ends, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to hurl fire at a creature or an object within 60 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes `d8` Fire damage.

**Cantrip Upgrade.** The damage increases by `d8` when you reach levels 5 (`2d8`), 11 (`3d8`), and 17 (`4d8`).

**Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]
