# Erik's Quills (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *cantrip*

**School**: *Conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a porcupine quill)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You conjure and throw 2d4 long quills, which unerringly strike one or two chosen targets within range, even getting in between the chinks in the targetâ€™s armor. Each does 1 point of piercing damage each, for each of three rounds, and remains in the wound.

The target may use a bonus action to yank a quill out, but that inflicts an addition-al 1 point of damage. Otherwise, the quills vanish in 10 minutes.

The number of quills you create increases by 2d4 when you reach 5th level (4d4), 11th level (6d4) and 17th level (8d4)
