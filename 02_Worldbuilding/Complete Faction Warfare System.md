[Quick Resolution Tables](#quick-resolution-tables) ### The Nature of Faction Warfare In Aquabyssos and Aethermoor, faction warfare isn't just military conflictâ€”it's a complex dance of politics, economics, espionage, and ideology. Every faction maneuvers for advantage across multiple dimensions of power, and today's ally is tomorrow's enemy. ### The Five Pillars of Power Every faction's strength rests on five pillars: 1. **Military Might**: Armed forces and combat capability


2. **Economic Strength**: Wealth and resource control
3. **Political Influence**: Legitimate authority and alliances
4. **Information Network**: Intelligence and secrets
5. **Ideological Unity**: Member loyalty and public support ### Power Rating System Each faction has a **Power Rating** from 0-100 in each pillar: | Rating | Status | Description |



|--------|--------|-------------|
| 0-10 | Collapsed | Non-functional, near dissolution |
| 11-25 | Weak | Struggling, vulnerable to absorption |
| 26-40 | Stable | Functional but limited influence |
| 41-60 | Strong | Regional power, growing influence |
| 61-80 | Domit | Major force, widespread control |
| 81-95 | Hegemonic | Near-total control of pillar |
| 96-100 | Absolute | Unchallenged supremacy | ### The War Clock Faction warfare operates on a **War Clock** with six phases: 1. **Peace** (Turns 1-4): Normal operations, building power

2. **Tension** (Turns 5-8): Increasing conflicts, positioning
3. **Crisis** (Turns 9-12): Open hostilities begin
4. **War** (Turns 13-20): Full conflict
5. **Exhaustion** (Turns 21-24): Resources depleted, seeking resolution
6. **Resolution** (Turn 25+): Victor emerges or peace restored #### Step 1: Determine Base Power


Roll 2d20+20 for each pillar, or assign based on faction concept: **Major Factions** (Tidal Council, Surface Seekers):
- Military: 60-80
- Economic: 50-70
- Political: 60-80
- Information: 40-60
- Ideological: 50-70 **Regional Factions** (Merchant Guilds, Criminal Syndicates):
- Military: 30-50
- Economic: 40-60
- Political: 30-50
- Information: 50-70
- Ideological: 40-60 **Fringe Factions** (Cults, Revolutionaries):
- Military: 20-40
- Economic: 20-40
- Political: 10-30
- Information: 30-50
- Ideological: 60-80 #### Step 2: Calculate Derived Statistics **Total Power** = Sum of all pillars / 5 **Action Points** = Total Power / 10 (round down)

- Used for faction actions each turn **Stability** = Lowest pillar rating
- Faction's vulnerability to collapse **Reach** = (Political + Information) / 20
- Number of territories that can be influenced **Resilience** = (Military + Ideological) / 20
- Resistance to attacks and subversion #### Natural Growth

- [[Reality Merger Mechanics]] - Cross-dimensional conflicts
- [[Memory Trading Economy]] - Information as resource
- [[NPC Quick Reference Guide]] - Individual loyalty within factions
- [[Political Intrigue Session]] - Personal-scale political play --- *In the depths and heights, power flows like waterâ€”always seeking its level, always finding the cracks. Control the flow, or be swept away by the tide of war.* ## Player-Facing Summary Complete Faction Warfare System is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Complete Faction Warfare System as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Complete Faction Warfare System. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is protecting a artifact for revenge
