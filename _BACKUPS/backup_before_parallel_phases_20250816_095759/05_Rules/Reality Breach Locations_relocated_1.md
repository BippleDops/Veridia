## Overview

Reality Breach Locations are sites where the barrier between normal existence and the [[Deep Mother's dream-realm has been worn thin or deliberately weakened. These areas serve as manifestation points for eldritch phenomena, gathering sites for cultists, and dangerous zones where the laws of physics become unreliable. Each location represents a wound in reality itself, slowly expanding as [The Deep Mother]]'s influence grows.

### The Sunken Cathedral (Primary Manifestation Site)

**Location**: 2 miles below Aquabyssos, in the Mariana Reach  
**Breach Intensity**: Catastrophic (Level 5)  
**Discovery DC**: 25 (requires specialized deep-sea equipment)

#### Description

Once the Grand Cathedral of [[Tidal Harmony, this massive structure was pulled into the depths during the first recorded manifestation event 47 years ago. The building itself exists in a state of architectural impossibility - its spires extend both upward and downward simultaneously, its halls connect to rooms that should not fit within its dimensions, and its prayer pools contain water from oceans that don't exist.

### The [Observatory of Broken Stars]]

**Location**: Mount Celestialis Peak, Aethermoor  
**Breach Intensity**: Major (Level 4)  
**Discovery DC**: 18 (visible from miles away as "wrong" light)

#### Description

This astronomical observatory was built at the highest point in Aethermoor to study celestial movements. When researchers attempted to [[map stars that "shouldn't exist," their instruments began receiving transmissions from the Deep Mother. The facility now exists partially in space, partially underwater, and partially in dimensions that lack names.

### The [Merchant]]'s Folly (Convergence Breach)

**Location**: [[Goldwater Trading Company [Warehouse District]]  
**Breach Intensity**: Growing (Level 3)  
**Discovery DC**: 15 (obvious to anyone with magical sensitivity)

#### Description

This began as a simple warehouse where merchant Codex Goldstream stored "unusual acquisitions." When he acquired a Deep Mother artifact without proper precautions, his entire [[Commercial District began experiencing reality fluctuations. The area now serves as a spontaneous marketplace between dimensions, with traders from impossible realms conducting business in currency that doesn't exist.

### The  Gardens (Extinction Zone)

**Location**: Former Royal Botanical Gardens, Aethermoor  
**Breach Intensity**: Critical (Level 4)  
**Discovery DC**: 10 (impossible to miss - plants don't exist there)

#### Description

These once-magnificent gardens became a reality breach when researchers tried to cultivate plants from the Deep Mother's realm. Instead of growing alien flora, the gardens became a zone where the concept of growth itself ceased to exist. Plants don't die here - they never existed in the first place. The space remains beautiful in a terrifying way, as visitors see perfect garden layouts with no plants, only the spaces where plants should be.

#### The Absent Gardener

**Groundskeeper Void** (CR 12): Still tends the non-existent gardens with tools that aren't there. He's friendly and helpful, offering tours of flowers that bloom in the spaces between thoughts. Completely unaware that anything is wrong.

---

### The Echo Marina (Temporal Breach)

**Location**: Port District, Aquabyssos  
**Breach Intensity**: Moderate (Level 2)  
**Discovery DC**: 12 (ships arrive before they depart)

#### Description

This busy marina experiences severe [Temporal Displacement]] due to a breach in the harbor's deepest point. Ships from past and future dock alongside present-day vessels. Cargo is unloaded before it's loaded, passengers disembark who haven't boarded yet, and harbor masters maintain schedules for voyages that both have and haven't happened.

### The Dreaming Library

**Location**: [[Academy of Deep Understanding  
**Breach Level**: 2  
**Effect**: Books write themselves with dreams of sleeping readers

### The Pressure Chamber

**Location**: Deep Sea Trading Guild Headquarters  
**Breach Level**: 2  
**Effect**: Interior exists at crushing depth pressure despite surface location

### The Inverted Lighthouse

**Location**: Beacon Point, Aethermoor  
**Breach Level**: 3  
**Effect**: Light points inward, illuminating the Deep Mother's realm

### The Memory Pool

**Location**: [Cultural Exchange]] Center  
**Breach Level**: 2  
**Effect**: Water contains liquefied memories from all who've touched it

### The Accountable Void

**Location**: Parliament of Shadows - Archive Chamber  
**Breach Level**: 3  
**Effect**: Empty filing cabinets contain documents that eat information

### Breach Expansion

Breach sites grow stronger and larger over [[Time:

| Level | Radius | Effects | Escape DC |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | 10 ft | Minor anomalies | 10 |
| 2 | 50 ft | Noticeable distortions | 13 |
| 3 | 200 ft | Reality becomes unreliable | 16 |
| 4 | 1 mile | Physics break down | 19 |
| 5 | 5+ miles | Existence becomes questionable | 22+ |

### Investigation Progression

1. **Initial Discovery**: Strange [reports]] dismissed as local eccentricity
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Multiple sites show similar anomalies
3. **First Contact**: Encounter with breach-affected [[Npcs or creatures
4. **Deep Investigation**: Exp[Lore]] major breach site, face serious dangers
5. **Revelation**: Understand connection to Deep Mother and cult activities
6. **Crisis Response**: Must prevent breach expansion or new breach creation
7. **Final Confrontation**: Battle in or for control of critical breach site

## Player-Facing Summary

Reality Breach Locations are areas where strange phenomena occur due to "geological instabilities" or "experimental accidents." These sites feature impossible architecture, temporal anomalies, or other [[Reality Distortions. While dangerous, they may also contain valuable information or unique opportunities. [Local Authorities]] often have these areas under investigation or quarantine, though their explanations rarely match the observed phenomena.

### [[Key Locations
1. Main entrance/approach
2. Central gathering area
3. Important buildings/features
4. Defensive positions (if applicable)
5. Hidden or secret areas

## [DM_Notes|DM Notes]]

Breach sites work best as investigative locations that gradually reveal their true nature. Start with subtle wrongness that players can rationalize, then slowly introduce elements that can't be explained normally. Each breach should feel unique while supporting the overall Deep Mother narrative.

Use breaches to foreshadow major campaign events - temporal anomalies can reveal future consequences, dimensional markets can provide needed items at narrative cost, and reality distortions can force players to question their assumptions about the world.

Remember that breaches are inherently unstable - they should feel dangerous even when not hosting active encounters. The environment itself is the primary antagonist.
