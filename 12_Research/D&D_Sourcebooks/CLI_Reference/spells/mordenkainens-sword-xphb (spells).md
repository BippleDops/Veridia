- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a miniature sword worth 250+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute You create a spectral sword that hovers within range. It lasts for the duration.

On your later turns, you can take a [[Action Xphb]] to move the sword up to 30 feet to a spot you can see and repeat the attack against the same target or a different one. **Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 302.
