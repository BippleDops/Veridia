# Detect Magic
*1st-level, Divination (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Sphere)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, you sense the presence of magical effects within 30 feet of yourself. If you sense such effects, you can take the [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears the magic, and if an effect was created by a spell, you learn the spell's "school of magic".

The spell is blocked by 1 foot of stone, dirt, or wood; 1 inch of metal; or a thin sheet of lead.
