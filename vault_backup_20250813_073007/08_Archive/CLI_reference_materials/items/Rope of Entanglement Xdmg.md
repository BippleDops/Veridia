# Rope of Entanglement
*Wondrous item, rare*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/rope-of-entanglement.webp#right)


This rope is 30 feet long. While holding one end of the rope, you can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action to command the other end to dart forward and entangle one creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or have the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] condition. You can release the target by letting go of your end of the rope (causing the rope to coil up in the target's space) or by using a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] to repeat the command (causing the rope to coil up in your hand).

A target [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] by the rope can take an action to make its choice of a DC 15 Strength ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) or Dexterity ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Acrobatics|Acrobatics]]) check. On a successful check, the target is no longer [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Restrained|Restrained]] by the rope. If you're still holding onto the rope when a target escapes from it, you can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb|Reaction]] to command the rope to coil up in your hand; otherwise, the rope coils up in the target's space.

The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/immunity-xphb|Immunity]] to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Point]] every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Point]]. If the rope drops to 0 [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]], it is destroyed.
