## Description
Gohls are nightmarish creatures that lurk in desolate ruins and subterranean caverns. No one is quite sure of their origin; some sages believe they traveled to the Material Plane from another dimension or even from the distant past or future. They are solitary creatures that favor humanoid prey above all else, but they are not above attacking and devouring any living thing that crosses their path.

A gohl is a 10-foot-wide, 10-foot-high, writhing mass of tentacles twined around three serpentine bodies with snakelike heads. Each head is gold with red eyes, and the mouths are lined with needle-sharp teeth. The snake bodies have gold-colored scales that shift to dark green near the central body mass, which can be any color. Gohls communicate with others of their kind by changing the colors of their tentacles and central body mass. They spend most of their lives alone, however, so when encountered by adventurers, a gohl’s body is likely to be a plain, splotchy mass of black and gray.

In combat, a gohl can release a loud, metallic-sounding roar. It does this in an effort to scare adversaries—as if its horrific appearance isn’t sufficient for that job.

Gohls make no effort to disguise themselves or to hide from opponents. They move to intercept intruders as soon as they detect something entering their territory. If it’s not too badly outnumbered, a gohl tends to concentrate its bite attacks against a single target—preferably one that’s also grappled. Foes that are killed or knocked unconscious by a gohl are carried to its lair, to be consumed later.
