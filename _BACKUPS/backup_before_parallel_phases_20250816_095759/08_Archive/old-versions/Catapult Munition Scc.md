*Adventuring gear* A catapult munition roughly the size and weight of a cannonball. The munition can be thrown up to 30 feet and explodes on impact. Any creature within a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the point of impact must make a **DC 14** Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (``dice: 10d6``) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, each object in that area that isn't being worn or carried takes 35 (``dice: 10d6``) fire damage. *Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 174* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Catapult munition scc is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
