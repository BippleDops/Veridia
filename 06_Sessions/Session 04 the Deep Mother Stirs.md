- -- # Session 4: [The Deep]] [[Mother Stirs * Level 4-5 Characters | 3-4 Hours | Investigation/Horror* ## 🔧 [Deep Evaluation]] Improvements * 20 targeted improvements identified* ### [[Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### [Enhancement Improvements]] - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## [[Session Overview The party's investigation into the strange memory loss epidemic leads them deeper into Aquabyssos's ancient secrets. As they follow the trail of missing memories, they uncover signs that something vast and terrible is beginning to wake in the deepest trenches of the ocean. [The Fourth]] Shard's influence grows stronger, and the party must confront the reality that their quest may have already set apocalyptic events in motion. ## [[Opening Scene: [The Memory]] [[Harvest The session begins in the **[Depth Archive]]**, where [[[Coral|Coral|Coral]] has been working tirelessly to understand the memory extraction patterns the party discovered. Therefore, ### [[Read Aloud * [The Archive]]'s bioluminescent reading chambers cast an eerie blue-green glow over countless memory pearls floating in preservation tanks. [[Archivist Coral-Mind looks up from her work, her usually steady hands trembling slightly.* * "I've analyzed the memory fragments you recovered," she says, her voice hollow. "The patterns... They're not random. Someone is harvesting specific memories - all related to ancient knowledge about the [Deep Trenches]]. Knowledge that was buried for excellent reason."* ## [[Investigation Phase: Following the [Deep Current]] The party must track the source of the memory extractions through Aquabyssos's underground network. ### Clue 1: [[The Forgotten Ward **[location|Location]]**: [[[[Ancient Memorial District|[Ancient Memorial]] District]] The party discovers that an entire district's worth of protective wards against "deep things" have been systematically dismantled. The ward-stones show signs of being dissolved by some kind of psychic acid. - **Investigation (**DC 15**)**: The dissolution pattern matches the memory extraction technique
- **History (**DC 18**)**: These wards were placed here after the "[[Silent Century" - a period erased from most historical records
- **[Arcana|Arcana]] (**DC 20**)**: The wards were specifically designed to contain something that feeds on knowledge itself ### Clue 2: [[The Dreaming Cultists **Location**: [[[Hidden Shrine]] of [[Forgotten Depths|[Hidden Shrine]] [[Of Forgotten Depths]] Following energy traces, the party finds a secret cult dedicated to [[[[The Deep Mother|[The Deep]] Mother]]. The cultists are in a trance state, continuously feeding stolen memories into a massive obsidian pool. **Encounter**: - 1 **[[Deep Oracle** (use Priest stats with psychic abilities)
- 4 **[Memory Thralls]]** (use Cultist stats, but attacks drain memories temporarily)
- 2 **[[Void Touched** (use Wraith stats, but incorporeal and feed on thoughts) ### Clue 3: [The Tidal]] Prophecy **Location**: [[[[observatory|Observatory of [Sunken Stars]]|[[Observatory Of [Sunken Stars]]]] The party finds [[[[Prophet Nerida Voidgazer|[Prophet Nerida]] Voidgazer]], one of the few people who remembers the ancient warnings. She's been hiding, knowing that her knowledge makes her a target. ### [[Read Aloud * The old prophet's eyes are milky white with cataracts, but they seem to see through dimensions. When she speaks, her voice echoes as if coming from a great depth.* * "[The Fourth]] Shard you seek... It was not lost, child. It was hidden. Bound. Used as a lock to keep Her sleeping. Every shard you claim weakens that binding. She stirs now, in dreams that shake the ocean floor."* #### [[Prophecy Revealed * "[Seven Shards]] to rule the depths complete, But four awakens what should never meet. [[The Mother dreams of stars again, When memory's thief breaks the chain. In deepest trench where light has died, [The Fourth]] Shard serves to stem the tide."* **[[Key Information**:
- [The Fourth]] Shard is acting as a binding agent, keeping [[[[The Deep Mother|[The Deep]] Mother]] in dormancy
- Claiming it will begin her awakening process
- The memory thefts are her way of "remembering" how to influence the waking world
- The party now faces a terrible choice: abandon their quest or risk apocalypse ## [[The Deep [Calling As]] the session progresses, all characters begin experiencing psychological effects from [[[[The Deep Mother|[The Deep]] Mother]]'s growing influence. ### [[Hourly Madness [Effects Each]] hour of the session, have all players roll a d20:
- **1-3**: Hear whispered words in an ancient language (Wisdom save **DC 12** or take `dice: 1d4` psychic damage)
- **4-6**: Experience brief visions of impossible ocean depths ([[Disadvantage|Disadvantage on next skill check)
- **7-9**: Feel compelled to move toward deep water (Wisdom save **DC 15** or spend turn moving toward nearest large body of water)
- **10+**: No immediate effect, but gain one point of "[Deep Calling]]" (track this) ### [[Deep Calling [Corruption Characters]] who accumulate 3+ [[Deep Calling points begin to change:
- **3 Points**: Can breathe underwater indefinitely, but feel uncomfortable in shallow water
- **5 Points**: Gain darkvision 120 feet, but bright light causes pain (disadvantage in sunlight)
- **7 Points**: Can communicate telepathically with other corrupted creatures, but struggle to speak aloud
- **10 Points**: Character becomes NPC [under]] DM control, now serving [[[[The Deep Mother|[The Deep]] Mother]] ## [[Major Decision Point: [The Fourth]] [[Shard The party discovers the location of the [[[Fourth Shard]] of Binding|[[Fourth Shard [Of Binding]]]] in the **[[Leviathan Graveyard**, a massive trench where ancient sea creatures go to die. But getting there requires passing through areas where [[[The Deep]] Mother|[[The Deep Mother]]'s influence is strongest. ### [[Options Presented 1. **Claim the Shard**: Continue the quest knowing it will accelerate the apocalypse
2. **Abandon the Quest**: Leave the shard as a binding, but fail their primary mission
3. **[Seek Alternative]]**: Try to find another way to contain [[[[The Deep Mother|[The Deep]] Mother]] while still claiming the shard ### [[Information Gathering If the party seeks more information:
- **Ancient texts** reveal that [[[The Deep]] Mother|[[The Deep Mother]] was bound by a coalition of the first Mer-Folk rulers and [[Aethermoor|Aethermoor wind-mages working together
- **Historical records** show that similar awakenings can be countered, but require artifacts from both realms
- **Current intelligence** suggests that someone in Aethermoor is also seeking the [Seven Shards]], possibly for similar world-threatening purposes ## [[Climactic Encounter: [The Leviathan]] [[Graveyard If the party chooses to proceed, they must navigate the treacherous **[Leviathan Graveyard]]**. ### [[The Guardian of the [Fourth Shard]] **[[The Forgotten Leviathan** - An ancient whale-like creature that has been guarding the shard for millennia, slowly being corrupted by [[[The Deep]] Mother|[[The Deep Mother]]'s influence. **Stats**: [[Use Ancient Dragon stats but aquatic, with these modifications: - **HP**: 200 (reduced from normal ancient dragon)
- **AC**: 18 (bone armor)
- **Speed**: 60 ft swim
- **[Damage Resistances]]**: Cold, Necrotic
- **[[Condition Immunities**: Charmed, Frightened
- **[Breath Weapon]]**: Sonic blast in 90-foot cone (`dice: 6d8` thunder damage, **DC 18** Constitution save for half, deafens for 1 minute on failure)
- **[[Memory Drain**: Once per turn, can attempt to steal memories from target within 60 feet (Charisma save **DC 18** or lose access to highest level spell slot/ability until long rest) ### Connection to [Larger Campaign]] - This session should feel like a major turning point
- The psychological horror elements here contrast with the political intrigue of earlier sessions
- Start planting seeds for the revelation that both realms face connected cosmic threats
- Use this as an opportunity to deepen character motivations and bonds - -- * "In the deepest waters, the greatest treasures lie alongside the greatest terrors. The wise navigator knows that some depths are meant to remain unexplored."* - [[Ancient Aquabyssos Proverb ## Related * Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research [Specific Content]] Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## [[Pronunciation Guide]] - **Mother**: [MOTHER]
