# Trap #40 - " ... Cool, Clear, Water!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> When the party emerges from the thirty foot corridor leading to the store room they will find that the stone block at the end of the original corridor is gone! They will also trigger a tilt plate that was not set until they opened the door to [[Trap #38 - _ ...I t Makes Me Feel Tingly All Over!_|Trap #38]].
> 
> This tilt plate starts a lyrical sound that right now is better than music to the delvers ears: The sweet tinkle of a fountain. The party can see it glinting in their torch light 40 feel away. The sparkle off ailing droplets will be an almost irresistible magnetto any party member who was in the store room for Three turns. (There is a 50-50 chance (L5) he will rush the water obsessively.) Those who have not entered the room, or were in the room for only one or two turns will be able to resist the lure.
> 
> Those party members who were in the room FOUR turns or more, will go mad with thirst and bolt for the water with a berserk singlemindedness! The beauty of this trap begins to unfold. (Now comes the REALLY great part!)
> 
> Upon entering the room the party will find a large shallow fountain. In the center of the fountain is the statue of a fish bodied deamon from whose mouth issues the scintilating stream of "water". The pool surrounding the fountain is over twenty feet round and almost fills the 30 foot by 30 foot room. The pool is only 2 feet deep, and in the bottom can be seen the glint of gold pieces. There are over 10,000 g.p. scattered about the bouom of the pool. The gold will make literally no difference to the berserk Three tum delvers and all Four or more turn delvers. What they see is the water!
> 
> The whole point is that this is not water! This is an extremely caustic concentration of **sulfuric acid!** Delvers in full possession of their faculties will have a 30% chance (L3) of detecting a faint tell-tale aroma that will give them pause, but the rest are Doomed to a hideous, burning demise!
> 
> There are always spoil sports in every crowd. If a delver detects the strangeness of the water he ( or they) may attempt to restrain their more affected counterparts. Their friends will fight furiously with whatever means is at hand to get to the "water". The carnage will be wonderful.
> 
> Assuming that no member of the party was in the store room too long, but they all fail to react to the acid smell, there is always the presence of the gold to get a delver to reach into the pool.
> 
> This acid will effect metal even more than leather armor, and is more likely to "leak" into it. Flesh will be extremely adversely affected by the acid. (I'd call turning bright red, blistering, and peeling away in shreds adversely affecting, but I'm a big fan of adverse affects.)
> 
> Any metal tools used to fish out the gold will be functionally useless after two turns from the effects of the acid. (It is very unlikely the party will have anything to dilute the acid, or a sufficient supply of caustic base substance to neutralize it on the tools or exposed skin.)
> 
> This trap is so diabolically set up that in combination with The Desication Room it rates the brightest four skulls. Even without the "dying of thirst" aspect the room rates three skulls on the premise that the delvers will play with it until they get burned .
