*Wondrous item, common* This 50-foot coil of rope can repair itself when cut into any number of smaller pieces. As a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you can cause all pieces of the rope that are in contact with each other and not otherwise in use to knit back together. A Rope of Mending is forever shortened if a section of it is lost or destroyed. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 302* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Rope of mending xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
