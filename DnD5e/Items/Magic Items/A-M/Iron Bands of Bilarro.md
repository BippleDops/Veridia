## Description
This rusty iron [[2 - Casting a Spell|sphere]] measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.

Make a ranged [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] roll with an attack bonus equal to your [[Dexterity|Dexterity]] modifier plus your [[3 - Proficiency Bonus|proficiency bonus]]. On a hit, the target is [[Restrained|restrained]] until you take a [[12 - The Order of Combat|bonus action]] to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a [[2 - Casting a Spell|sphere]] once more.

A creature, including the one [[Restrained|restrained]], can use an action to make a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 20 [[Strength|Strength]] check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.

Once the bands are used, they canâ€™t be used again until the next dawn.
