*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 142. Available in the SRD* When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to change the casting time to a [[Action Xphb for this casting. You can't modify a spell in this way if you've already cast a level 1+ spell on the current turn, nor can you cast a level 1+ spell on this turn after modifying a spell in this way. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Quickened spell xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
