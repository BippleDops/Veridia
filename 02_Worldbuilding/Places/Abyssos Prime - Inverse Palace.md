# Abyssos Prime - Inverse Palace

*Where reality bends inward and the depths dream of ascension*

## Overview

The [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Inverse Palace]] stands as the most paradoxical structure in all of [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], defying both architectural logic and the fundamental laws of physics. Built not upon the ocean floor but suspended in the crushing darkness between tectonic plates, this impossible fortress serves as the seat of power for the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Abyssal Court]] and the primary residence of [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Sovereign]].

What makes the palace "inverse" is its fundamental rejection of directional reality - corridors flow upward into deeper waters, stairs descend toward surface pressures, and gravity itself seems negotiable within its coral-wrought halls. The structure exists in a state of perpetual architectural rebellion, where the concept of "up" and "down" become matters of political allegiance rather than physical law.

## Architectural Impossibilities

### The Inverted Spires

The palace's most striking features are its **seventeen towering spires** that pierce not upward but deeper into the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Crushing Depths]]. Each spire serves as both a residential wing and a dimensional anchor, tethering different layers of reality to prevent the palace from drifting into the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Void Between Pressures]]. The spires are:

- **The Coral Throne Spire**: Where [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Sovereign]] holds court
- **The Whisper Archives**: Repository of [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Forbidden Knowledge]] and [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Eldritch Secrets]]
- **The Pressure Gardens**: Impossible spaces where [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Abyssal Flora]] grows in zero-pressure environments
- **The Temporal Anchor**: Prevents the palace from slipping through time
- **The Memory Vaults**: Where the experiences of the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Drowned]] are stored
- **Fourteen Lesser Spires**: Housing for the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Abyssal Nobility]] and their retinues

### The Gravity Wells

Throughout the palace, **localized gravity wells** create pockets where the normal rules don't apply. These were created by [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Deepcaster]] [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Void-Touched]] mages using rituals that required the sacrifice of entire [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Leviathan]] pods. Key gravity-defying areas include:

- **The Ascending Throne Room**: Where petitioners must "fall upward" to approach [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Sovereign]]
- **The Inverted Gardens**: Coral forests that grow in all directions simultaneously
- **The Paradox Pools**: Bodies of water that flow in impossible loops
- **The Weightless Archives**: Where knowledge itself has mass and must be contained by gravitational fields

## The Abyssal Court

### The Deep Sovereign

At the heart of the palace rules [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Sovereign]], a being whose true nature remains shrouded in [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Pressure Shadows]]. Those who have survived an audience describe a figure that seems to exist in multiple dimensions simultaneously - sometimes appearing as a massive [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Kraken]]-like entity, other times as a humanoid figure wreathed in bioluminescent tentacles.

### The Pressure Lords

Below The Deep Sovereign are the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/People/Pressure Lords]], twelve powerful entities who each control different aspects of the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Crushing Depths]]. They include:

- [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/People/Lord Bathysmal]]: Master of the deepest trenches
- [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/People/Lady Pelagic]]: Commander of the open waters

- [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Earl Demersal]]: Master of the palace's living architecture

## Environmental Hazards

### Pressure Flux Storms

The palace exists in a constant state of **pressure flux**, creating dangerous environmental conditions:

**Pressure Storm** (Environmental Hazard)
- Occurs every 2d6 hours
- All creatures must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw
- Failure: 3d10 force damage and knocked prone
- Success: Half damage, not knocked prone
- Equipment may be damaged or destroyed (DM's discretion)

### Inverse Gravity Zones

**Gravity Reversal Trap**
- Triggered when creature enters specific areas
- DC 20 Perception to notice gravitational anomalies
- Sudden gravity reversal: DC 16 Dexterity save or take 2d6 bludgeoning damage from falling "upward"
- Disorientation: Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks for 1 minute

### Madness-Inducing Architecture

**Architectural Madness**
- Prolonged exposure to the palace's impossible geometry
- After 24 hours: DC 15 Wisdom save or gain one level of madness
- Each additional day: DC increases by 2
- [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Eldritch Knowledge]] skill checks can help navigate safely

## Notable Locations Within the Palace

### The Ascending Throne Room

The palace's main audience chamber defies comprehension. Visitors must "fall upward" through a series of increasingly impossible spaces, passing through:

- **The Chamber of Reflected Pressures**: Where the weight of water becomes visible light
- **The Hall of Inverted Mirrors**: Showing not reflections but alternative timeline versions of viewers
- **The Gravity Garden**: A vast space where coral formations exist in complex three-dimensional patterns
- **The Threshold of Sovereignty**: The final barrier before the throne, where reality completely breaks down

### The Whisper Archives

This repository contains knowledge gathered from across the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Multiverse]], stored in crystallized forms that can only be accessed by those who have survived the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Deep Initiation]]. The archives contain:

- Maps of the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Pressure Territories]]
- Histories of the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Sunken Civilizations]]

- Intelligence on surface world activities gathered by [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Deep Spies]]

### The Living Corridors

Many of the palace's passages are actually enormous, dormant creatures from the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Elder Deep]]. These bioarchitectural elements serve multiple functions:

- **Digestive Hallways**: Can consume intruders if activated
- **Neural Corridors**: Allow rapid communication throughout the palace
- **Muscular Passages**: Can contract to trap or redirect movement
- **Sensory Networks**: Constantly monitor all activity within the palace

## Political Intrigue

### The Ascension Plot

A growing faction within the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Abyssal Court]] believes the time has come to abandon the depths and conquer the surface oceans. Led by [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/People/Lord Bathysmal]], this group seeks to use the palace's reality-warping capabilities to:

- Create permanent [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Pressure Portals]] to surface waters
- Establish [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Inverse Colonies]] on the ocean floor
- Convert surface-dwelling sea creatures to serve the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Deep Sovereign]]
- Ultimately transform all oceans into extensions of [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]

### The Deep Purists

Opposing the Ascension Plot are the **Deep Purists**, traditionalists who believe the palace should remain hidden in the depths. They argue that:

- Surface contact risks exposure to [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Solar Corruption]]
- The palace's power depends on its isolation
- Integration with surface waters would dilute their [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Abyssal Essence]]
- The [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Ancient Pacts]] with the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Elder Things]] forbid such expansion

### The Temporal Rebellion

A secretive faction has discovered that the palace's [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Temporal Anchor Points|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/Temporal Anchor Points]] can be manipulated to access alternate timelines. They seek to:

- Find timelines where the [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Great Sundering]] never occurred
