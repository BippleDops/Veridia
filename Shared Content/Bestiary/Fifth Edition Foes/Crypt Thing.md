## Special Traits
**Teleport Other (1/Day):** Once per day as an attack, a crypt thing can teleport all creatures within 50 feet of it to another location. A targeted creature resists teleporting with a successful DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. Affected creatures are teleported a random distance (`dice: 1d10` x 100 feet) in a random direction. Roll separately for each creature that fails its saving throw. A teleported creature arrives in an open space as close as possible to the determined destination spot. A creature can teleport into midair rather than onto a solid surface, if the crypt thing wishes. A creature that teleports into midair takes falling damage normally unless it has some means to prevent falling.

**Claw:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6 (`dice: 1d8+2`) slashing damage.

## Description
Crypt things are undead creatures found guarding tombs, graves, crypts, and other such structures. They are created by spellcasters to guard such Areas, and they never leave their assigned area.

A crypt thing never initiates combat. It is content to sit or stand in its assigned area so long as intruders do not disturb it or violate any of the conditions it was set to guard. At the first sign of disturbance, a crypt thing springs to action. Its first order of business is to attempt to remove the interlopers from its assigned area by using its teleport other attack. Opponents that resist teleportation are attacked by the crypt thing with its claws. A crypt thing’s natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunities.

Another variety of crypt thing is rumored to exist, called a crypt guardian. It has all the same abilities and statistics as a crypt thing, with one change. The crypt thing’s teleportation ability is replaced with the following cloak other ability.

**Cloak Other (1/day):** Once per day as an attack, a crypt guardian can paralyze all creatures within 50 feet. A targeted creature resists paralyzation with a successful DC 13 Con saving throw. Creatures that fail the saving throw are paralyzed and turned invisible. Affected creatures remain paralyzed and invisible for `dice: 2d4` days. The saving throw can be repeated at the end of each 24-hour period, with both conditions ending early on a successful save.

## Additional Details
**Credit**: The crypt thing originally appeared in the First Edition Fiend Folio (© TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981) and is used by permission. According to an article by Don Turnbull in Dragon #55 (© TSR/Wizards of the Coast, 1981), the crypt thing was never intended to be an undead creature, though somehow it evolved into that over the years.
