![[5n53gobu.uyl.png|Horde, Larva|300]]
[[5n53gobu.uyl.png|open outside]]

*This hideous mass is composed of bloated, human-size maggots that curl and twist in a tangle of disgusting bodies. Worse is the fact that each of these worm-things has a human face — that of a man or a woman, mouth agape, and distorted into an expression of utmost horror and suffering.*

**Horde:** The horde can occupy the same space as other creatures. Up to four Medium or smaller creatures can share the same space as the larva horde, or one Large creature. All creatures that are in the larva horde’s space at the start of the horde’s turn take `dice: 6d6` slashing damage and, if they aren’t grappled already, must make a successful DC 14 Str saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 13).

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The horde bites four times, regardless of how many creatures it has grappled.

**Melee Attack—Bite:** +6 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d6 + 3` piercing damage, and the creature must make a successful DC 14 Str saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 13) and pulled into the horde’s space.

**Area Attack—Burst of Bile:** All creatures in the larva horde’s space or within 10 feet of it take `dice: 3d6` acid damage, or half damage with a succesful DC 14 Dex saving throw.

## Description
**Environment**: Any (Abyss)

**Organization**: Solitary, ball (2–5), or judgment (6–15)

The souls of chaotic evil peoples find their way to the Abyss where they become a type of petitioner called a larva. Though sentient, these worm-like proto-demons find themselves subjected to every form of degradation imaginable, until their minds break and they become little more than animalistic embodiments of torment and rage. Those that survive being devoured by demons, stolen by night hags, sacrificed by liches, or struck down by the myriad unnatural [[Appendix C - Hazards|hazards]] of that realm are forced to sup upon the foul effluvia that drains to its lowest gutters, unfit even for the demons’ guard beasts. Those larvae that are able to endure these torments and that consume enough of this Abyssal filth eventually find themselves transformed into the lowest of demons from where they can begin their improbable opportunity to rise to power within the Abyss. Most never last that long, and on many occasions when large numbers of larvae are present, they gather together into a massive tangled horde both for mutual DEFENSE and to feed upon each other as a pleasant change from their normal diet. On some occasions, a larva that is able to fend off and consume an entire horde of its brethren may find itself elevated to the ranks of demons much sooner than would otherwise be possible, so larvae attempt to form a horde whenever possible in order to increase that possibility.
