# Pearl Harbor City
*Gateway Between Worlds*

## Overview

Pearl Harbor City stands as Aquathys's primary connection to the surface world, a bustling metropolis built within a massive underwater dome that maintains variable pressure zones. The city exists in a constant state of controlled chaos as traders, smugglers, diplomats, and adventurers from both above and below the waves converge here.

- Notable: Black market pressure suits sold by [[The_Crimson_Pearl]]

#### **Embassy Row**
Diplomatic quarters for various factions and surface nations. Heavily warded and patrolled by [[The Depth Wardens]].
