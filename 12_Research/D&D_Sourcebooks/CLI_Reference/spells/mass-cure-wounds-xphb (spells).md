# Mass Cure Wounds
*5th-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes out from a point you can see within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius [[sphere-area-of-effect-xphb|Sphere]] centered on that point. Each target regains [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] equal to `5d8` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The healing increases by `d8` for each spell slot level above 5.

**Classes**: [[list-spells-classes-druid|Druid]]; [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"|Sorcerer (Divine Soul)]]; [[list-spells-classes-cleric|Cleric]]; [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-life-domain-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Cleric (Life Domain)]]; [[/03 Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-circle-of-the-moon-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Druid (Circle of the Moon)]]; [[list-spells-classes-bard|Bard]]
