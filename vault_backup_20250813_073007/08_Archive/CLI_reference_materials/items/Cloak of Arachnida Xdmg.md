# Cloak of Arachnida
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*  



This fine garment is made of black silk interwoven with faint, silvery threads. While wearing it, you gain the following benefits.

## Poison Resistance

You have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/resistance-xphb|Resistance]] to Poison damage.

## Spider Climb

You have a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/climb-speed-xphb|Climb Speed]] equal to your [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb|Speed]] and can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

## Spider Walk

You can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/difficult-terrain-xphb|Difficult Terrain]].

## Web

You can cast [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/web-xphb|Web]] (save DC 13). The web created by the spell fills twice its normal area. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn.
