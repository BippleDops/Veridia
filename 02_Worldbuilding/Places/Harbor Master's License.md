Harbor Master's License is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Harbor Master's License as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Harbor Master's License.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Harbor Master's License to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
