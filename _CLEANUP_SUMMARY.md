## Issues Resolved

1. **Bases Syntax Errors**: Removed all Bases files with incorrect filter syntax
2. **Duplicate Files**: Eliminated all duplicate .base files from archives
3. **Outdated Documentation**: Removed 18 outdated documentation files
4. **README Consolidation**: Created single, current README.md
5. **Archive Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary archive folders

## Recommendation

The Bases files I created had syntax errors because the filter expressions need to follow specific Obsidian Bases syntax. The original 9 Bases files that came with the vault are working correctly and should be used.

For future Bases creation:
- Use the existing working files as templates
- Test filter syntax carefully
- Avoid complex boolean expressions in filters

## Total Files Removed: 37

The vault is now cleaner with only current, working files remaining.
