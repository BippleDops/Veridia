# Fire Charm (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a piece of very thin multicolored silk that you throw into the fire)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You light a fire (such as a bonfire, brazier, fireplace, candle, or lantern) while casting this spell and a gossamer veil of faint, multi-hued cool fire surrounds the flame; then you issue a suggestion of 12 words or less, which has the same restrictions and ability as the *suggestion* spell. Creatures that canâ€™t be charmed are immune to this effect. You are not affected by this spell.

You may choose up to 4 creatures within range who can see the flame and can understand must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is magically influenced by your word and will pursue the course of action you described to the best of its abilities.

If you or any of your companions damage one of the targets, the spell ends for that tar-get.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you may charm an additional 2 creatures for each slot level above 4th.
