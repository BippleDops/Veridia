# Gem of Brightness
*Wondrous item, uncommon*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/gem-of-brightness.webp#right)


This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action and use one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:

- **First Command Word.** The gem sheds [[bright-light-xphb|Bright Light]] in a 30-foot radius and [[dim-light-xphb|Dim Light]] for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn't expend a charge. It lasts until you take a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.  
- **Second Command Word.** You expend 1 charge and cause the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the [[conditions#Blinded|Blinded]] condition for 1 minute. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.  
- **Third Command Word.** You expend 5 charges and cause the gem to flare with intense light in a 30-foot [[cone-area-of-effect-xphb|Cone]]. Each creature in the [[cone-area-of-effect-xphb|Cone]] makes a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.  

When all of the gem's charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 GP.
