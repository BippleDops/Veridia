# Ammunition of Slaying
*Ammunition, very rare*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/ammunition-of-slaying.webp#right)


This magic ammunition is meant to slay creatures of a particular type, which the DM chooses or determines randomly by rolling on the table below. If a creature of that type takes damage from the ammunition, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra `6d10` Force damage on a failed save or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

After dealing its extra damage to a creature, the ammunition becomes nonmagical.
