## Description
A smithâ€™s work, strong though it may be in battle, wears quickly beneath the ravages of rust. By coating weapons in animal fat or (for highly valued [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Items|items]]) wax, a smith can protect the steel products, leaving them shiny for sale. Both substances are durable and easily applied to hot [[Metal|metal]]. Fat: 5 cp/lb; Wax 5 sp/lb.
