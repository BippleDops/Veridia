# Spiritual Weapon
*2nd-level, Evocation*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/spiritual-weapon.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a floating, spectral force that resembles a weapon of your choice and lasts for the duration. The force appears within range in a space of your choice, and you can immediately make one melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of the force. On a hit, the target takes Force damage equal to `d8` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

As a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] on your later turns, you can move the force up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d8` for every slot level above 2.
