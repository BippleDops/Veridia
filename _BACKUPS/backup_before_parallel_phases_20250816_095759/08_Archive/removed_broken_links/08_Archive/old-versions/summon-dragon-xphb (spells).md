--- # Summon Dragon

*5th-level, Conjuration* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/summon-dragon.webp#right) - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (an object with the image of a dragon engraved on it worth 500+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour You call forth a Dragon spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the [[draconic-spirit-xphb (dragon) stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 [hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] or when the spell ends. The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your [[Initiative Xphb count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [actions#Dodge|Dodge]] action and uses its movement to avoid danger. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block. **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 324.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of summon dragon xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around summon dragon xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - The authorities needs help delivering before the festival
