## Description
Kruthiks hatch from eggs laid by female adults. Each egg is about the size of an adult human's head and hatches within a month. Tiny kruthik hatchlings are harmless, rarely stray far from the nest, and feed primarily on offal and one another. Within a month, the survivors become young kruthiks large enough to hunt and defend themselves.
