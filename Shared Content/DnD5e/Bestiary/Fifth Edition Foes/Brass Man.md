## Special Traits
**Immunity to Magic:** A brass man automatically succeeds on all saving throws against spells and spell-like effects. If a successful saving throw reduces damage by half, the brass man takes no damage instead. In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature, as noted below (these effects override its immunity).

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A brass man attacks twice with its fists, or twice with its greatsword, or once by spitting molten brass.

**Fist:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (`dice: 1d10+5`) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (`dice: 1d10`) fire damage.

**Greatsword:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 19 (`dice: 2d12+5`) slashing damage.

**Molten Brass (Recharge 5—6):** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* automatic hit, range 30 ft. line, all creatures in line. Hit: 30 (`dice: 6d8`) fire damage. Targets that make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw take half damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Elemental plane of fire

**Organization**: Solitary or squad (2–4)

## Description
Brass men are humanoid-shaped constructs built by the powerful efreet of the City of Brass. Most are created for the sole purpose of guarding secrets within the walls of the city, with a few serving as war machines to aid the efreet in battle against their enemies. They are rarely encountered elsewhere, though on occasion one is sent to the Material Plane by its efreet creator to retrieve an object or creature.

Brass men are very tough opponents and difficult to stop. Typically, a brass man begins combat by spitting molten brass onto the closest opponents before moving into melee with its huge greatsword or its powerful fists.

**Construction:** The construction of the brass men is a highly guarded secret among the efreet. No one outside the City of Brass has ever discovered the proper method of constructing a brass man, and the efreet certainly won’t share the secret.
