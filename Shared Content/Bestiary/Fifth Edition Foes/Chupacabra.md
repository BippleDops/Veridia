## Description
Chupacabras are small, terrifying bloodsuckers that lurk on the fringes of society. They emerge from their hiding places at night to drain blood from warm-blooded creatures. Though they aren’t particularly selective when it comes to who or what they feed on, chupacabras prefer to attack creatures they can easily overpower (such as small livestock or children). Many chupacabra attacks are blamed on vampires, wild dogs, or wolves (because they often tear a victim’s corpse into pieces in a rage if the creature dies too soon). If the chupacabra leaves any tracks, however, a skilled observer can readily tell the attacker was small, bipedal, and barefoot.

A chupacabra is a vaguely humanlike creature, but if there is any true relationship between the species, the chupacabra is a frighteningly degenerate cousin. They stand only 3 or 4 feet tall but look even shorter because of their severely stooped posture. A chupacabra’s body is covered in patchy, dark, filthy fur. Their eyes are bright red and appear to glow when they catch the light from a lantern or torch. Their arms and legs end in four digits with dull black claws.

A chupacabra cannot speak in any intelligible way. Instead, it utters a baleful moan when frightened, or howls when threatened. If a chupacabra grabs a foe, it slashes at the victim’s throat and greedily slurps up the blood.

A small proportion (10 percent) of chupacabras have fur-covered, batlike wings that enable them to fly, albeit somewhat clumsily. They seldom use their wings in combat, but instead use flight to seek victims far from their lairs, making it more difficult for enemies to track them back to the safety of their hidden dens.
