# Evocation School of Magic
*The Art of Destruction, Energy, and Force*

> *"In the crushing depths where every breath is earned through struggle, evocation becomes more than the art of destruction - it is the fundamental expression of will against entropy. We do not simply cast fire into water; we command reality itself to burn."*
> — [[Arcane Destroyer Tidal Stormcaller]], Master of Combat Magic at the [[War College of Depths]]

## Overview

Evocation represents one of the most feared and respected schools of magic across both [[Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos]], encompassing the arts of destruction, energy manipulation, and force projection. In the vast underwater realm where traditional weapons lose effectiveness and conventional warfare becomes impossible, evocation has evolved into sophisticated systems of combat magic, environmental control, and reality manipulation that enable civilization to defend itself against cosmic threats.

The school's principles center on the direct manipulation of raw magical energy to create destructive effects, generate elemental forces, and project power across vast distances. Evocation operates through the fundamental understanding that magical energy can be shaped and directed to achieve immediate, dramatic effects that bypass natural limitations and conventional defenses.

In [[Aquabyssos]], evocation has developed unique characteristics due to the underwater environment's energy-conducting properties and the proximity to cosmic forces that amplify magical effects. Practitioners have mastered techniques for directing destructive force through water, channeling pressure as a weapon, and accessing void energy for attacks that transcend conventional physics.

The school serves multiple crucial functions in underwater society: defending cities from hostile creatures and cosmic threats, clearing obstacles for construction and exploration, providing energy for large-scale magical systems, and maintaining the balance of power that prevents any single force from dominating the ocean depths.

Advanced evocation practitioners can channel forces equivalent to natural disasters, manipulate fundamental energy types including void and temporal forces, create permanent changes to the environment, and even briefly access cosmic-level power for effects that reshape reality within localized areas.

## Magical Theory and Principles

Evocation magic operates on the fundamental principle that raw magical energy can be directly shaped and projected to create immediate effects in the physical world without requiring complex transformations or intermediate steps.

### Core Theoretical Framework

**Energy Manifestation**: Evocation works by converting magical power directly into physical forces - heat, cold, electricity, force, and sound - that can affect the material world. This direct conversion makes evocation spells among the most efficient for achieving immediate, dramatic results.

**Elemental Channeling**: The manipulation of elemental energies operates through establishing resonance with fundamental forces that exist throughout reality. Practitioners learn to access these forces and direct them according to their will, creating effects that can range from subtle environmental changes to catastrophic destructions.

**Force Projection**: The creation of kinetic effects works by using magical energy to directly manipulate matter and energy at a distance, bypassing normal physical limitations. This allows for effects like magical barriers, telekinetic manipulation, and force-based attacks that ignore conventional defenses.

**Reality Alteration**: Advanced evocation involves temporarily rewriting local physical laws to permit effects that would normally be impossible. This requires sophisticated understanding of how magical energy interacts with fundamental forces and careful control to avoid catastrophic backfires.

### Underwater Adaptations

**Pressure Channeling**: [[Aquabyssos]] evocation incorporates ocean pressure as both a medium for energy transmission and an amplification mechanism. Water's density allows for more efficient energy conduction while pressure differentials can be used to enhance the power and range of evocation effects.

**Thermal Dynamics**: Underwater evocation has been adapted to work within the ocean's thermal layers, using temperature differentials to create more efficient heating and cooling effects. Practitioners can manipulate thermal dynamics to create localized weather systems or devastating temperature attacks.

**Sonic Manipulation**: Sound travels more efficiently through water than air, making sonic-based evocation particularly powerful in underwater environments. Advanced practitioners can create sound-based attacks that are devastating to underwater creatures while being nearly undetectable to surface dwellers.

**Void Integration**: The proximity to cosmic forces has allowed [[Aquabyssos]] evokers to channel void energy - a destructive force that exists outside normal reality. This provides access to attacks that can bypass conventional defenses but requires extreme caution due to corruption risks.

### Advanced Applications

**Environmental Reshaping**: Master evokers can permanently alter large areas through sustained applications of destructive and creative force, reshaping ocean floors, creating new landmasses, or establishing permanent environmental changes that last for centuries.

**Dimensional Weaponry**: Advanced practitioners can channel energy from other dimensions or time periods, creating attacks that exist partially outside normal reality and are therefore nearly impossible to defend against using conventional methods.

**Collective Destruction**: Multiple evokers working together can create effects that exceed the sum of their individual capabilities, establishing devastating attacks that can threaten entire regions or even cosmic-level entities.

**Coordinator Depth Thermalkeeper**: Expert in precision temperature control who ensures that delicate magical systems and biological processes are protected from harmful thermal fluctuations.

## Forbidden and Lost Spells

### Reality Destruction Techniques
Spells that cause permanent damage to the fundamental structure of reality are strictly forbidden due to their potential for creating unstable zones where normal physics cannot function. These techniques were developed during wartime but proved too dangerous for practical use.

**The Dimensional Scar Incident**: A historical attempt to create a permanent void weapon resulted in a region where reality remains fundamentally unstable. This area continues to expand slowly and resists all attempts at repair, serving as a warning about the dangers of ultimate destruction magic.

**Universe Crack Spells**: Techniques that attempted to damage the fundamental laws of physics across large areas. These spells were theoretically capable of making entire regions uninhabitable by any form of life, but also risked spreading beyond the intended target area.

### Temporal Destruction Magic
Spells that attacked targets throughout their entire timeline or attempted to erase them from history have been forbidden due to the risk of creating temporal paradoxes that could unravel causality itself.

**Chronological Annihilation**: Legendary spell that could destroy targets by erasing them from every point in time simultaneously. The few attempts to use this technique created timeline instabilities that required cosmic intervention to resolve.

**Time Death Magic**: Techniques that killed targets in the past, present, and future simultaneously. These spells were lost deliberately due to their tendency to create causal loops that made them impossible to control safely.

### Lost Cosmic Channeling
Ancient knowledge of channeling energy directly from cosmic sources - stars, black holes, dimensional barriers, and universal forces - has been lost to time. These techniques provided incredible power but required perfect control to avoid destroying the caster and their surroundings.

**Star Heart Channeling**: Historical techniques for drawing energy directly from stellar cores, providing virtually unlimited power for evocation effects. The knowledge was lost after several practitioners were consumed by the forces they attempted to control.

**Void Lord Communion**: Spells that established direct energy channels with cosmic entities existing in void space. These techniques provided access to reality-altering force but also exposed practitioners to influences that inevitably transformed them into something no longer mortal.
