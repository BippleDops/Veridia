# Afterword

> For the Elemental Evil story, we tried to bring the elemental cults to life in a way that we'd never done before. We also wanted to make sure that each cult had its own identity and recurring motifs. Water cultists have scaly skin. Air cultists use elemental devices, such as *balloon packs* and *wingwear*, to fly. Fire cultists harness the forge to create all sorts of fiery implements and weird ironworks. Earth cultists meld their flesh with stone.

> Because the cultists are insane, it's easy to imagine many crazy ideas. Water cultists riding giant walruses! Earth cultists with purple worm hatcheries! It's all good. This appendix contains a sampling of the concept art we commissioned for the Elemental Evil story, not all of which ended up in this adventure. Sometimes we went in directions that proved too wacky for our tastes, but hopefully you'll see something here that inspires you.

## Player-Facing Summary

11 afterword is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of 11 afterword as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around 11 afterword.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties 11 afterword to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at 11 afterword to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to 11 afterword active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
