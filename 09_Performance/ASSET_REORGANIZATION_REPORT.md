# Asset Reorganization & Tagging Report

Generated: 2025-08-15T18:33:24.592Z

## Summary

Successfully reorganized and tagged all assets in the vault.

## Statistics

- **[[Assets|Assets]] Moved**: 32352
- **Assets Tagged**: 32002
- **Total Assets**: 32002
- **Errors**: 0

## New Organization

Assets are now organized in their proper folders without "Generated" subdirectories:

```
04_Resources/Assets/
├── Portraits/       # Character portraits
├── [[location|Location]]s/       # Location scenes
├── [[Maps|Maps]]/           # World and area maps
├── [[Items|Items]]/          # Item artwork
├── Creatures/      # Monster illustrations
├── Tokens/         # Game tokens
├── Scenes/         # Dramatic scenes
├── [[Handouts|Handouts]]/       # Player resources
├── Audio/          # Music and sounds
├── Special/        # Campaign-specific
└── Misc/           # Other assets
```

## Tagging System

All assets now have comprehensive tags:

### Tag Categories Applied:
- **Asset Type**: portrait, location, map, item, creature, token, handout
- **Quality**: generated, enhanced, placeholder
- **Campaign**: aquabyssos, aethermoor, generic
- **Style**: fantasy, realistic, painterly, ethereal, dark
- **Usage**: combat, social, exploration, puzzle
- **Specific**: npc, boss, legendary, magical, weapon, armor, city, dungeon

## Benefits

1. **No Nested Folders**: Assets are directly in their category folders
2. **Rich Tagging**: Multiple tags per asset for better searchability
3. **Tag-Based Organization**: Use tags instead of folders for categorization
4. **Improved References**: All markdown links updated to new paths
5. **Clean Structure**: Removed empty Generated subdirectories

## Usage

### Finding Assets by Tag:
- Search for `tag:portrait` to find all portraits
- Search for `tag:aquabyssos` for campaign-specific assets
- Search for `tag:generated` for all AI-generated content
- Combine tags: `tag:portrait tag:npc tag:aquabyssos`
