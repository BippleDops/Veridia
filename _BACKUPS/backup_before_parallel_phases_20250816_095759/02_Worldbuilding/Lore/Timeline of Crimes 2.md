# Timeline of Crimes
*Chronological Framework for Understanding Conspiracy Development Across History*

> *"Crime is not a single moment of transgression - it is a pattern that extends across time, connecting past injustices to present conspiracies and future catastrophes. The Timeline of Crimes reveals that what we call 'history' is often nothing more than the winner's account of successful criminal enterprises, while the true patterns of conspiracy and corruption remain hidden beneath layers of official narrative and deliberate misdirection."*
> — [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Master Chronologist Temporal Truthkeeper, "Patterns in Time: How Criminal Conspiracies Shape History"

## Overview

The Timeline of Crimes serves as the comprehensive chronological framework for understanding how conspiracy activities have developed across the history of both [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos. Unlike conventional historical timelines that focus on official events, political developments, and cultural achievements, this framework tracks the hidden patterns of criminal conspiracy, secret manipulation, and covert operations that have shaped the true course of events in both worlds.

This timeline recognizes that many supposedly independent historical events are actually connected elements of long-term conspiracy activities, with some criminal enterprises spanning centuries or millennia. By organizing these hidden activities chronologically, investigators can identify recurring patterns, understand how past crimes enable present conspiracies, and predict likely future criminal developments.

The framework encompasses everything from individual criminal acts to vast multi-generational conspiracies like [02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Final Choice]], providing investigators with the temporal context needed to understand how current criminal activities fit within larger historical patterns. Each entry includes not only the criminal act itself, but also its connections to other conspiracy activities, its long-term consequences, and the evidence patterns it created for future investigation.
