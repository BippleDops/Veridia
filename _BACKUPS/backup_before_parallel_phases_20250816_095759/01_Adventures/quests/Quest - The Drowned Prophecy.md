**Difficulty**: Moderate (Levels 3-5)

Ancient prophecies are manifesting as physical objects in [[The Shadowmere|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Shadowmere's Lake Gloom—crystallized predictions of a coming flood that will transform Aethermoor into a second Aquabyssos. Someone is collecting these prophecy shards, and their intent could either prevent or ensure this catastrophic future. ## Quest Hook

[Sister Morwyn Veilkeeper|02 Worldbuilding/People/Sister Morwyn Veilkeeper]] contacts the party through disturbing dreams, showing visions of Crystalhaven underwater, its citizens transformed into aquatic horrors. She reveals that prophecy shards are being stolen from Lake Gloom, and without them, she cannot determine which future is becoming real. ### Initial Investigation

**Lake Gloom Disturbance:**
- Witness sites where shards were extracted
- Find Aquabyssos coral growing in shadow water (impossible naturally)
- Discover deep-dweller tracks leading to underwater passages
- Local shadowkin report seeing "fish people" that shouldn't exist here **Clues Found:**
- Tidal Court diplomatic seal (leads to [[Ambassador Nerida Deepcurrent|02 Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Nerida Deepcurrent)
- Crystal Warden patrol schedule (inside information)
- Payment ledger in Whisper Syndicate cipher (involves [Vex Shadowthorn|02 Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn]]) ### The Embassy Investigation

**Infiltrating the Cerulean Depths:**
- [[Ambassador Nerida Deepcurrent|02 Worldbuilding/People/Ambassador Nerida Deepcurrent's embassy shows signs of recent construction
- Hidden basement contains portal pool to [The Sunken Markets|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Sunken Markets]]
- Diplomatic papers discussing "accelerated integration timeline"
- Servants are deep-touched, showing early signs of aquatic transformation **Confronting the Ambassador:**
- Can be diplomatic or aggressive approach
- Nerida admits knowledge but claims she's trying to prevent the prophecy
- Reveals that someone in Crystalhaven government is the true collector
- Offers alliance if party investigates her rivals ### The Sunken Markets Trail

**Following the Smuggling Route:**
- [[Vex Shadowthorn|02 Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn has been moving prophecy shards through the markets
- Claims he's just the middleman, doesn't know final buyer
- [Marcus Shardbreaker Grimm|02 Worldbuilding/People/Marcus Shardbreaker Grimm]] hireded to protect shipments
- Marcus reveals buyer uses Crystal Warden codes **The Depth Speaker's Warning:**
- Ancient entity in the Sunken Markets recognizes the danger
- Reveals that collecting all prophecy shards can either: - Summon Thal'mexis, the Sunken Sovereign - Create a barrier preventing the Great Drowning
- The intent of the user determines the outcome ### The True Conspirator

> [!warning] DM Secret

> [[Prince Caspian Duskwater|02 Worldbuilding/People/Prince Caspian Duskwater is collecting the shards, believing he can use them to overthrow his mother and prevent both the crystal corruption and the drowning. He's being manipulated by Thal'mexis through dreams. **Evidence Points:**
- Crystal Warden resources diverted to "special projects"
- Prince's recent interest in ancient histories
- Secret meetings with various faction representatives
- His quarters contain early transformation symptoms ### The Prophecy Chamber

**Location:** Hidden vault beneath the Crystal Throne
- Prince has constructed a ritual chamber
- Five prophecy shards already in place (two more arriving soon)
- Ancient Aquabyssos architecture (pre-dates Crystalhaven)
- Tidal marks showing water has been here recently **The Confrontation:**
- Prince genuinely believes he's saving the kingdom
- Shows visions of his mother's corruption worsening
- Argues that controlled flooding is better than crystal plague
- Can be reasoned with (**DC 18** Persuasion) or fought ## DM Notes

This quest bridges the gap between the crystal corruption storyline and the introduction of Aquabyssos as a major threat. It provides personal stakes (the prince's family drama), moral complexity (no perfect solution), and connections to multiple factions. The prophecy shards can become recurring plot devices, and the outcome significantly affects the campaign's direction. The investigation structure allows for both combat and social solutions, while the various NPCs provide different approaches to problem-solving. ## Player-Facing Summary Quest The Drowned Prophecy is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Quest The Drowned Prophecy as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Quest The Drowned Prophecy. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Related Notes - [Similar Topic 1]]
