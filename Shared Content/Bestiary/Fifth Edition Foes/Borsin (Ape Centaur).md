## Description
A borsin is a creature with the head, arms, and upper body of an ape joined to the body and legs of a quadruped. The lower half may be that of a boar, equine, or hound. In that regard they resemble centaurs, but they are less massive and far more brutish than those majestic creatures. They are suspected to have been magically crossbred as battle-beasts in antiquity. Unlike a centaur, a borsin has only a savage, animal cunning, though they are capable of problem-solving and setting crude traps. They fight only with their teeth and claws, never their hooves.

They do not use weapons or tools, or carry treasure. Pack leaders have been seen to drape themselves in the skins and furs of creatures they have killed, including those of humanoid adventurers. Borsin form packs led by the strongest member. They use pack tactics to drive opponents and prey into traps, kill zones, or natural hazards such as cliffs and ravines.

Borsin packs stake out their territory by raising small cairns of stone topped with the skulls of their kills, and they patrol their borders regularly. They often grunt, howl, and gesture to each other, but whether they have an actual, simple language is unknown. Borsin are omnivorous and hardy, capable of surviving on plants but much preferring freshly-killed meat.
