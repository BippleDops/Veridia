# Thornwhisper Manor - The Unfrozen Estate

*A pocket of preserved time in the depths of corruption*

## Overview

Thornwhisper Manor stands as a haunting monument to desperate love and temporal magic gone wrong. Once the grand estate of [[Lady Vivienne Thornwhisper]], this magnificent underwater mansion exists in a state of temporal suspension, caught between moments when the lady attempted to save her family from the encroaching corruption. Now known as "The Unfrozen Estate," it serves as both a treasure trove of pre-corruption artifacts and a deadly maze of temporal anomalies.

## Physical Description

The manor is a sprawling complex of interconnected coral towers and kelp gardens, all suspended in shimmering bubbles of frozen time. The architecture represents the height of pre-corruption [[Aquabyssos]] nobility:

### Main Structure
- **The Grand Ballroom**: A massive chamber where guests are forever frozen mid-dance
- **The Crystal Conservatory**: Rare plants from both [[Aquabyssos]] and [[Aethermoor]] in eternal bloom
- **The Temporal Library**: Books that rewrite themselves as time fluctuates
- **Living Quarters**: Bedrooms where inhabitants sleep in suspended animation
- **The Sealed Wing**: Lady Vivienne's private chambers, heavily warded against intrusion

### Grounds
- **The Maze of Moments**: Hedge maze where each path exists in a different time period  
- **Fountain of Years**: A temporal nexus that shows visions of the past and future
- **The Servant's Quarters**: Where the manor's staff remain trapped in their daily routines
- **The Stables**: Housing creatures from multiple time periods simultaneously

### The Frozen Household

#### [[Lord Aldric Thornwhisper]] (Deceased/Frozen)
The lady's husband, preserved at the moment of his death from corruption. Sometimes speaks prophetic warnings when the temporal fields fluctuate.

#### [[Marcus Thornwhisper]] (Son, Age 12)
Caught in an eternal loop of playing with his toys. Occasionally becomes aware of his situation and begs for release.

#### [[Elena Thornwhisper]] (Daughter, Age 16)  
Frozen while reading a book of poetry. Her tears of crystal that fall continuously have magical properties.

#### [[Jeeves]] (Butler)
An elderly human who maintains the manor despite being temporally displaced. Exists in multiple time periods simultaneously and remembers everything.

### Temporal Echoes
Ghostly impressions of past events that play out repeatedly:
- **The Corruption's Arrival**: Shadowy figures spreading darkness through the estate
- **The Last Dance**: Guests celebrating, unaware of approaching doom  
- **The Ritual**: Lady Vivienne's desperate attempt to freeze time

## Environmental Features

### The Temporal Field
The entire estate exists within overlapping temporal effects:
- **Time Dilation**: Some rooms experience time slower or faster than normal
- **Temporal Loops**: Certain areas repeat the same moments endlessly
- **Chronological Instability**: Past, present, and future blend together
- **Memory Stones**: Crystals that record and replay past events

### The Corruption Barrier
- **Temporal Shield**: The frozen time prevents corruption from fully entering
- **Decay Pockets**: Areas where corruption has begun to seep through
- **Purification Zones**: Places where the lady's magic actively fights corruption

## Environmental Hazards

### Temporal Anomalies
The manor is riddled with dangerous time effects:

#### Time Loops (Various rooms)
- **Effect**: Creatures must make DC 16 Wisdom saves or repeat their last action
- **Duration**: 1d4 rounds
- **Escape**: Successful save or taking damage breaks the loop

#### Aging Fields (Random encounters)
- **Rapid Aging**: DC 18 Constitution save or age 1d10 years permanently
- **Youth Drain**: DC 18 Constitution save or become 1d10 years younger
- **Temporal Sickness**: Exhaustion that cannot be removed until leaving the manor

#### Chronological Displacement
- **Past Echoes**: Suddenly experience events from manor's history (DC 15 Wisdom save or be stunned for 1 round)
- **Future Visions**: See potential futures (DC 17 Intelligence save or be frightened for 1 minute)
- **Temporal Vertigo**: Multiple time streams visible simultaneously (DC 14 Constitution save or be incapacitated)

### The Unsealed Corruption
In areas where temporal protection has failed:
- **Shadow Tendrils**: 1d6 necrotic damage to creatures entering affected areas
- **Corruption Whispers**: DC 16 Wisdom save or be charmed by shadowy voices
- **Temporal Rot**: Equipment ages and degrades rapidly (10% chance per hour of losing 1 point of AS or weapon damage)

## Treasure and Resources
