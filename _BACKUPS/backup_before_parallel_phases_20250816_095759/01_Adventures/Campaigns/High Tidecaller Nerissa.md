--- # High Tidecaller Nerissa *A religious quest involving the corruption and potential redemption of a powerful sea priestess whose connection to her goddess has been tainted by dark influences* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview High Tidecaller Nerissa was once considered among the most blessed servants of Thalassa, the Sea Mother, in all of Aquabyssos. Her prayers could calm the most violent storms, her healing touch could mend wounds that no other magic could reach, and her wisdom guided countless souls through the turbulent currents of life. The Tidal Sanctum, her temple built within living coral formations, was a place of pilgrimage for faithful from across the realm. Her connection to the divine was so strong that many believed she would eventually ascend to become a minor deity herself. However, six months ago, everything changed. During the Festival of Deep Currents, Nerissa's most sacred ceremony turned into a nightmare when her divine magic went catastrophically wrong. Instead of blessing the gathered faithful, her prayers summoned twisted sea creatures and dark tidal forces that devastated the temple and injured dozens of worshippers. Since that terrible day, Nerissa has been unable to access her divine magic properly, and her attempts at spellcasting often produce unpredictable and dangerous results. The once-beloved priestess has become a source of fear and suspicion among her own followers. The quest begins when Acolyte Pelagic, one of Nerissa's few remaining loyal followers, approaches the party with a desperate plea for help. He believes that his mentor has not fallen from grace but has instead become the victim of some dark influence that is blocking her connection to Thalassa. With the temple's reputation in ruins and calls growing for Nerissa's removal from office, time is running out to discover the truth and potentially save both the priestess and her sacred mission. The investigation will lead the party through the complexities of religious politics, ancient magical corruption, and the question of whether redemption is possible even for those who have fallen the furthest. ### Stage 1: The Sanctuary in Crisis

**Objective**: Investigate the current state of the Tidal Sanctum and understand the nature of Nerissa's condition **Details**:
- Meet with Acolyte Pelagic in the damaged outer chambers of the Tidal Sanctum
- Interview witnesses from the Festival of Deep Currents disaster
- Examine the physical and magical damage to the temple
- Attempt to speak with High Tidecaller Nerissa (initially unsuccessful)
- Research the history of the temple and Nerissa's past achievements
- Investigate potential sources of the corruption affecting her **The Tidal Sanctum**:

Once a magnificent temple carved from living coral, now partially collapsed and showing signs of unnatural decay. The holy waters that once sparkled with divine light are now murky and occasionally emit strange sounds. The very walls seem to weep a dark substance that resists all attempts at cleaning. **Key NPCs**:
- **Acolyte Pelagic**: Young but devoted follower, the only cleric who still believes in Nerissa
- **Deacon Corallius**: Senior temple official calling for Nerissa's removal
- **Sister Nautilia**: Former acolyte, now working to document the disaster
- **Brother Delian**: Temple guard who witnessed the catastrophic ceremony **Investigation Reveals**:
- The magical corruption appears to be external in origin
- Strange symbols have appeared throughout the temple that don't match any known divine script
- Nerissa has been experiencing prophetic nightmares for weeks before the disaster
- Several valuable religious artifacts went missing shortly before the Festival **Skill Challenges**:
- Religion checks to understand the theological implications
- Investigation checks to analyze the physical evidence
- Insight checks to read the motivations of various temple members
- Arcana checks to study the nature of the magical corruption **Rewards**: 500 gp from temple funds, temporary sanctuary in temple, access to religious records ### Stage 2: The Trail of Corruption

**Objective**: Discover the source of the dark influence affecting Nerissa and the temple **Details**:
- Follow leads about the missing artifacts to black market dealers
- Investigate reports of strange activities in the Coral Gardens
- Track down a mysterious figure seen near the temple before the disaster
- Explore the underwater caves beneath the Tidal Sanctum
- Confront cultists of the Drowned God who have been targeting the temple
- Recover the stolen Tide Chalice, a powerful artifact of Thalassa **The Coral Gardens Investigation**:

The beautiful coral formations near the temple have been showing signs of disease and corruption. Local marine life has been behaving strangely, and several areas of coral have turned completely black. Investigation reveals that someone has been conducting dark rituals in hidden grottos within the gardens. **Key Discoveries**:
- The stolen artifacts are being used in rituals to corrupt Nerissa's divine connection
- A cult dedicated to Abyssos, the Drowned God, has been orchestrating the attack
- The cult leader is Nerissa's own brother, Triton, who she thought had died years ago
- The corruption was meant to turn Nerissa into a vessel for the Drowned God **Combat Encounters**:
- Corrupted Coral Guardian (CR 6) - temple guardian twisted by dark magic
- Cult Infiltrators (4x CR 3) - posing as temple workers
- Abyssal Sea Spawn (6x CR 2) - summoned creatures serving the cult
- Deep Stalker (CR 7) - aberrant creature attracted to the corruption **Environmental Hazards**:
- Corrupted holy water that causes necrotic damage
- Unstable coral formations that can collapse
- Pockets of toxic algae that create poisonous clouds
- Temporal distortions around areas of strongest corruption **Key Locations**:
- **The Black Grotto**: Hidden cave where dark rituals are performed
- **Merchant Quarter's Underground**: Where stolen artifacts are trafficked
- **The Sunken Shrine**: Ancient temple to the Drowned God, recently reactivated
- **Nerissa's Private Chambers**: Contains clues about her family history ### Stage 3: Confronting the Past

**Objective**: Face Triton and his cult while attempting to cleanse the corruption from Nerissa **Details**:
- Infiltrate or assault the Sunken Shrine of the Drowned God
- Confront Triton and learn the truth about his survival and corruption
- Recover all stolen artifacts and disrupt the ongoing corruption ritual
- Attempt to purify the Tide Chalice using knowledge gained from investigation
- Make the difficult choice of how to deal with Triton
- Begin the process of cleansing Nerissa's divine connection **Triton's Revelation**:

Nerissa's brother reveals that he didn't die in the shipwreck that supposedly claimed his life years ago. Instead, he was rescued by servants of the Drowned God and gradually converted to their cause. His love for his sister turned to jealousy and resentment as he watched her achieve everything he had always wanted. The corruption of her divine connection was his revenge, intended to bring her down to his level. **The Sunken Shrine**:

An ancient temple dedicated to Abyssos, built in a deep underwater trench. The architecture is deliberately unsettling, with impossible angles and surfaces that seem to writhe when not directly observed. The altar is surrounded by whirlpools that draw in any who approach carelessly. **Major Combat: Triton and His Followers**:
- **Triton, Fallen Tidecaller** (CR 9): Nerissa's brother, now a warlock of the Drowned God
- **Abyssal Tide Cultists** (6x CR 4): Devoted followers with corrupted divine magic
- **Avatar of the Drowned God** (CR 8): A manifestation summoned during the battle **Moral Dilemmas**:
- Can Triton be redeemed or must he be destroyed?
- Should the party focus on saving Nerissa or stopping the immediate threat?
- How much of the temple's corruption can actually be undone?
- What price is too high to pay for redemption? **Ritual Elements**:

The party must perform a complex ritual to cleanse the Tide Chalice while defending against waves of enemies. This requires splitting attention between combat and spellcasting, creating tactical challenges. ### Stage 4: The Deep Maw Pilgrimage

**Objective**: Take Nerissa on a dangerous spiritual journey to restore her connection to Thalassa **Details**:
- Guide the weakened Nerissa to the Deep Maw, a sacred site of Thalassa
- Navigate treacherous underwater currents and hostile sea life
- Protect Nerissa during her vulnerable state as she attempts divine communion
- Face trials that test both the party's and Nerissa's worthiness
- Confront manifestations of Nerissa's guilt and self-doubt
- Witness the potential restoration of her divine connection **The Deep Maw**:

A massive underwater chasm that descends far beyond the reach of any mortal explorer. The walls are covered with naturally formed symbols that seem to shift and change when viewed directly. At certain depths, the water itself becomes luminous with divine energy. This is one of Thalassa's most sacred sites, where the goddess is said to speak directly to those worthy of her attention. **The Trials of Restoration**:
1. **Trial of Humility**: Nerissa must acknowledge her pride and mistakes
2. **Trial of Forgiveness**: She must forgive Triton and herself
3. **Trial of Purpose**: She must rediscover her true calling as a servant of Thalassa
4. **Trial of Sacrifice**: She must choose what she's willing to give up for redemption **Environmental Challenges**:

- Extreme pressure at the deepest levels requires magical protection
- Temporal distortions make navigation difficult
- Divine energy surges that can overwhelm unprepared minds
- Encounters with primordial sea creatures drawn to the sacred site **Spiritual Encounters**:
- **Manifestation of Thalassa** (divine presence, not combat)
- **Nerissa's Guilt** (CR 6 psychic construct)
- **Echo of Triton's Betrayal** (CR 5 emotional trauma given form)
- **Test of the Depths** (skill challenge rather than combat) **Possible Outcomes**:
- **Full Restoration**: Nerissa regains all abilities and additional divine favor
- **Partial Success**: Powers return but with limitations or conditions
- **Transformed Purpose**: Nerissa gains different but equally valid divine role
- **Noble Failure**: Nerissa doesn't regain powers but finds peace and new purpose ### Stage 5: Renewal and Consequences

**Objective**: Deal with the aftermath of Nerissa's journey and establish the temple's new future **Details**:
- Return to the Tidal Sanctum and assess what can be rebuilt
- Help Nerissa address the concerns of her remaining followers
- Establish new security measures to prevent future corruption
- Decide the fate of repentant cult members and corrupted temple officials
- Oversee the rededication ceremony for the cleansed temple
- Address the political ramifications within Aquabyssos's religious community **Temple Restoration**:

The physical damage to the Tidal Sanctum can be repaired, but the spiritual healing requires ongoing effort. The party may need to help establish new traditions, train new acolytes, or create safeguards against future corruption. **Nerissa's New Role**:

Depending on the outcome of her trials, Nerissa might return to her former position, take on a new role within the religious hierarchy, or choose to serve Thalassa in a completely different way. Her experience has changed her, and she may have new insights to offer. **Community Relations**:

The disaster has damaged relationships between different religious factions in Aquabyssos. The party's actions and the outcome of Nerissa's restoration will influence how these groups interact going forward. **Final Encounters**:
- **Rededication Ceremony**: A complex ritual requiring skill challenges
- **Political Negotiations**: Social encounters with various religious leaders
- **Remaining Corruption**: Final cleansing of stubborn tainted areas ### High Tidecaller Nerissa

**Role**: Corrupted Religious Leader and Redemption Seeker
**Description**: A middle-aged sea elf with once-luminous blue skin now marked by dark veins of corruption. Her silver hair floats constantly as if underwater, and her eyes show the pain of losing her divine connection. Despite her fall, she maintains dignity and genuine care for others.
**Motivation**: Regain her goddess's favor and restore her temple
**Key Information**: Knows ancient religious secrets and has prophetic dreams
**Character Arc**: From corrupted failure to potentially redeemed servant ### Acolyte Pelagic

**Role**: Loyal Follower and Quest Giver
**Description**: A young triton with bright green scales and earnest gold eyes. He wears simple temple robes and carries a staff topped with living coral. His faith in Nerissa remains unshaken despite all evidence.
**Motivation**: Prove his mentor's innocence and restore the temple
**Key Information**: Has access to temple records and knows Nerissa's daily habits
**Character Development**: Learns that faith sometimes requires difficult choices ### Triton, the Fallen Tidecaller

**Role**: Primary Antagonist and Family Tragedy
**Description**: Once identical to his sister in appearance, Triton now bears the marks of his pact with the Drowned God. His skin has a sickly gray pallor, and shadows seem to cling to him. His eyes hold years of resentment and corrupted wisdom.
**Motivation**: Destroy his sister's reputation and convert her to his dark patron
**Key Information**: Knows the family's secret history and the temple's vulnerabilities
**Combat Stats**: CR 9 warlock with aquatic themes and corrupted divine magic ### Deacon Corallius

**Role**: Political Opposition and Institutional Voice
**Description**: An elderly merfolk with elaborate fin decorations and formal ceremonial robes. He represents the temple's traditional hierarchy and is genuinely concerned about institutional damage.
**Motivation**: Protect the temple's reputation and maintain religious order
**Key Information**: Understands the political implications of the crisis
**Character Arc**: May become ally or opponent depending on party's actions ### Religious Atmosphere

The quest explores themes of faith, corruption, redemption, and the price of forgiveness. The underwater setting adds beauty and danger to religious sites, while the corruption creates stark contrasts between pure and tainted areas. ### Tidal Magic Mechanics

Throughout the quest, magic behaves differently during different tidal periods. High tide might enhance certain spells while low tide makes others more difficult. This creates timing elements for various encounters and rituals. ### Coral Architecture

The living coral construction of the Tidal Sanctum creates a unique environment where the building itself can be healed or corrupted. This makes restoration efforts more tactile and visually interesting. ### Divine Intervention

The goddess Thalassa takes a more active role in this quest than typical divine beings, providing signs, tests, and eventual judgment on the characters' actions. ### Redemption Themes

This quest is fundamentally about whether people can be redeemed after falling from grace. Allow players to explore different approaches to forgiveness and justice, and be prepared for them to find creative solutions to moral dilemmas. ### Religious Sensitivity

While the quest deals with religious corruption, it should ultimately be respectful of faith and religious institutions. The corruption comes from external sources rather than inherent flaws in the belief system. ### Variable Outcomes

Nerissa's restoration doesn't have to be all-or-nothing. Consider partial successes, changed roles, or alternative forms of redemption that might be more interesting than simple restoration to her former position. ### Scaling Options

- **Lower Level (3-6)**: Focus on investigation and social encounters, reduce combat
- **Higher Level (11-15)**: Add more powerful divine manifestations and complex rituals
- **Roleplay Heavy**: Emphasize character development and moral choices over action The High Tidecaller Nerissa quest offers players the chance to explore themes of faith, corruption, and redemption while navigating the beautiful and dangerous world of underwater religious communities in Aquabyssos. ## Player-Facing Summary High Tidecaller Nerissa is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
