*1st-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot Cone)
- **Components:** V, S

A thin sheet of flames shoots forth from you. Each creature in a 15-foot [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb|Cone]] makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `3d6` Fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Flammable objects in the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb|Cone]] that aren't being worn or carried start [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/traps-hazards/burning-xphb|burning]].

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d6` for each spell slot level above 1.
