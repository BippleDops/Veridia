Satyrs enjoy demonstrating their physicality through contests, evicting party poopers, and defending Fey realms.

## Satyrs

*Horned and Hoofed Revelers*

- **Habitat.** Forest, Planar (Feywild)  
- **Treasure.** Implements  

Satyrs embody the untamed joys of the wilderness. They indulge in sprees of merrymaking—eating, drinking, performing, fighting, and frolicking.
