## Overview

The Void Touched Depths represent one of [[Aquabyssos's most terrifying natural phenomena: a massive trench system where reality itself has been infected by something from beyond the cosmos. Located at [Crushing Depths]] where even [[Aboleth|[Aboleth Prime Yoth]] fears to venture, these trenches pulse with an alien hunger that consumes not just matter and energy, but concepts, memories, and the fundamental building blocks of existence itself.

### The Screaming Gradient (18,000-20,000 feet)

**[[The Threshold of Madness**
- Water becomes viscous with dissolved nightmares
- Gravitational anomalies pull in multiple directions simultaneously
- Temperature: 32°F (0°C) but heat is actively drained from living beings
- Pressure: 540 atmospheres (instant death for unprepared)
- First whispers of [[Oracle|The Void Touched [Oracle]]]] begin here
- Bioluminescent organisms glow with impossible colors

### The Consumption Zone (20,000-22,000 feet)

**Where Existence Becomes Optional**
- Matter randomly phases in and out of reality
- Living creatures begin experiencing "existence stuttering"
- [[Time flows in broken fragments
- Temperature: Meaningless—cold is a concept being devoured
- Pressure: Non-Euclidean (affects soul as much as body)
- The Void's influence becomes actively hostile

### The Heart of Void (22,000-25,000 feet)

**The Cosmic Wound**
- Reality is completely unstable—laws of physics are suggestions
- Multiple dimensions overlap and cancel each other out
- Temperature: The concept of temperature has been eaten
- Pressure: Exists in quantum superposition
- The Void Touched Oracle's true form resides here
- Portal to the space between spaces

#### The Unnamed Things

**CR 15 (Individual) / CR 20 (Swarm)**
- Creatures that exist in the spaces between thoughts
- Cannot be directly observed—only their effects
- Feed on the concept of identity
- Leave reality tears in their wake
- Reproduce by consuming memories of themselves

#### Existence Feeders

**CR 12**
- Shark-like entities that hunt by erasing prey from reality
- Bite attacks remove targets from the [Timeline]] temporarily
- Invisible until they attack
- Pack hunters that coordinate across dimensions
- Leave "existence shadows" of their victims

#### Void Touched [[Leviathans

**CR 18**
- Massive creatures partially phased out of reality
- Can attack from multiple dimensions simultaneously
- Immune to conventional damage
- Their presence causes reality instability in 1-mile radius
- Each one is unique—no two follow same physical laws

#### The Probability Fish

**CR Variable (1-20 depending on observation)**
- Schools of fish that exist in quantum superposition
- Observing them collapses their wave function unpredictably
- May become harmless minnows or cosmic horrors
- Their movements predict future disasters
- Sought after by [Prophet Nerida Voidgazer]] for divination

### Existence Drain

****DC 25** Constitution save every 10 minutes**
- Failure: Lose one aspect of identity (memory, skill, relationship)
- Critical Failure: Begin phasing out of reality
- Accumulative: Each failure increases next DC by 2
- Protection: Conceptual anchors, reality-stabilizing crystals

### Reality Stutters

**Random occurrence every hour (roll d20, 1-3 triggers)**
- Everything freezes for `dice: 1d4` rounds except consciousness
- During stutter: see all possible outcomes of current situation
- After stutter: one random possibility becomes reality
- May result in paradoxes that damage sanity

### Void Whispers

****DC 20** Wisdom save when entering any zone**
- Failure: Hear the Void Touched Oracle's voice
- Oracle offers power in exchange for "small sacrifices"
- Each deal erases something the character values
- Eventually leads to complete void corruption
- Success: Immunity for 24 hours

### [[Temporal Displacement

**Automatic effect in Heart of Void**
- Characters may arrive before they left
- Actions can prevent their own past decisions
- Meeting past/future selves causes reality fractures
- Only one timeline can ultimately survive
- Changes ripple through all of Aquabyssos history

### Void Crystals

**Legendary Material**
- Crystallized nothingness that weighs negative mass
- Can store anti-magic and un-spells
- One crystal can power reality stabilizers for months
- Harvesting requires sacrificing memories to the void
- Worth more than kingdoms to the right buyers

### Existence Essence

**Divine Component**
- Distilled reality in liquid form
- Can restore erased beings back to existence
- One drop can heal any conceptual damage
- Formation process unknown and irreproducible
- Guarded by [The Oracle]]'s most loyal servants

### Probability Pearls

**Rare Magical Items**
- Form inside creatures exposed to quantum uncertainty
- Allow manipulation of chance and causality
- Each use has 10% chance of creating paradox
- Highly sought by [[Sage Lysander Deepthought
- Can be weaponized to cause reality cascades

### Temporal Amber

**Ancient Preservation Medium**
- Fossilized time containing prehistoric moments
- Viewing reveals events from before [The Drowning]]
- Can be broken to release temporal energy
- Some pieces contain still-living pre-flood creatures
- Key ingredient in chronomantic rituals

### [[Memory Pearls of the Consumed

**Tragic Artifacts**
- Final thoughts of those erased by the void
- Contain skills and knowledge of the consumed
- Using them spreads void corruption
- Some hold secrets lost to history
- Collected obsessively by the [Silverscale Consortium]]

### Identity and Nature

**The Cosmic Wound's Voice**
- Once-mortal explorer who discovered the void portal
- Fused with alien intelligence from beyond reality
- Exists partially outside spacetime
- Speaks in overlapping voices from multiple timelines
- Cannot lie but truth changes based on observation

### The Oracle's Bargains

*"In the end, we learned that some mysteries are meant to remain unsolved—not because they're complex, but because understanding them means ceasing to exist. The void doesn't just kill you. It makes it so you never were, and that's a fate infinitely worse than death."*

—Final log entry of the *Deep Discovery*, recorded after the ship's destruction
