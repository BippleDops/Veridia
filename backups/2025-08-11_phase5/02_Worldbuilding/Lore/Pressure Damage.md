# Pressure Damage

*"The deep demands respect - ignore pressure at your mortal peril."*

## Overview
Pressure Damage represents the various physical and magical injuries that result from exposure to the crushing depths of Aquabyssos or rapid pressure changes during inter-realm travel. This environmental hazard affects not just surface dwellers venturing underwater, but can also impact underwater inhabitants when magical protection fails or when they travel to areas of extreme depth variation.

## Historical Background
Pressure damage was one of the first hazards documented during early surface-to-depth expeditions. Initial diving attempts resulted in catastrophic casualties until magical protection methods were developed.

## Current State
Modern understanding includes both physical pressure effects and magical pressure damage caused by dimensional stress. Protection methods have improved but remain imperfect.

## Mechanics
### Requirements
Occurs during:
- Unprotected deep-water diving
- Rapid pressure changes
- Magical protection failure
- Exposure to pressure-based attacks

### Effects
- **Crushing Damage**: Direct physical injury from water pressure
- **Decompression Sickness**: Rapid ascent complications
- **Magical Disruption**: Pressure interferes with spell casting
- **Equipment Failure**: Gear damaged by pressure changes

### Duration
Immediate damage with potential long-term complications requiring magical healing.

## Adventure Hooks
1. **Deep Rescue**: Characters must save someone suffering severe pressure damage
2. **Equipment Failure**: Pressure protection fails during critical mission
3. **Pressure Warfare**: Combat involving pressure-based attacks

## Campaign Use
Provides realistic environmental challenges and consequences for deep-water exploration.
