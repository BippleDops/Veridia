## Description
Ice drakes are found in cold, mountainous caves and chasms. Most encounters are with a solitary drake. Only in the winter months is it common to find a mated pair or family. An ice drake’s scales are white, and it is often mistaken for a young white dragon (especially when it chooses to appear as one). Ice drakes range from 3 feet to 6 feet long.
