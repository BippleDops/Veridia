# Bexley Port Authority

## General Info
**Location**: [[Bexley]]

## Description
The Bexley Port Authority is the law enforcement agency that is responsible for patrolling the waters around the city of Bexley. They are a well-trained and well-equipped force, and they are dedicated to keeping the peace.

## GM Notes
- The Port Authority is led by the tough and determined Captain Helena Stormwatch.
- The Port Authority is a rival of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Crimson Tide Pirates.md]].
- The Port Authority is a potential ally for the party, but they are also very by-the-book and will not tolerate any illegal activities.
