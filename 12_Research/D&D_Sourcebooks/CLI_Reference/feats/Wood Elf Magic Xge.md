*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 75*  

**Prerequisite**: [[elf-xphb|Elf]]

You learn the magic of the primeval woods, which are revered and protected by your people. You learn one druid cantrip of your choice. You also learn the [[longstrider-xphb|longstrider]] and [[pass-without-trace-xphb|pass without trace]] spells, each of which you can cast once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast these two spells in this way when you finish a long rest. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for all three spells.
