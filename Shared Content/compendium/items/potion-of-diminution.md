# Potion of Diminution
*Potion, minor, rare*  

- **Cost**: ⏤
- **Weight**: ⏤

When you drink this potion, you gain the "reduce" effect of the [enlarge/reduce](/compendium/spells/enlarge-reduce.md) spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion's liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.
