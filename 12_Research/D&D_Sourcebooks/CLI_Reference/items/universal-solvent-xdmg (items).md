# Universal Solvent
*Wondrous item, legendary*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/universal-solvent.webp#right)

This tube holds milky liquid with a strong alcohol smell. When found, a tube contains `1d6 + 1` ounces.

You can take a [[actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action to pour 1 or more ounces of solvent from the tube onto a surface within reach. Each ounce instantly dissolves up to 1 square foot of adhesive it touches, including Sovereign Glue.
