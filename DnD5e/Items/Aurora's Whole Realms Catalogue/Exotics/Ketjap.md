## Description
From the eastern lands beyond Durpar comes a new flavor wonder. There in the kitchens of caliphs and viziers, the chefs of Durpar created a new condiment using the exotic new fruits of Maztica. Now, for the first time in the west I offer the results of their effortsâ€”ketjap. This thick, spicy condiment is the perfect addition to grilled and roasted meats, adding flavor to an otherwise plain meal. (20 gp/pt.)
