# Tentacles (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (10-foot long tentacles)

**Components**: V, M (a dried octopus tentacle)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour


## Effects
Two 10-foot-long greenish tentacles grow out of your body. You may use them as addi-tional arms. They grant you one additional attack: you may use the tentacles to wield weapons, using your proficiency bonus, or to slam an opponent, using your spell attack modifier.

If you use them to slam, they inflict 2d6 + your Strength modifier in bludgeoning damage, and if the creature is your size or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC equal to your spell save DC) and restrained until the grapple ends. You may only grapple as many creatures as you have available tentacles. At the beginning of each of your turns, you constrict, inflicting an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage as long as the creature is restrained.

Each tentacle has AC 11 + your Dexterity modifier and 8 hit points. Damage inflicted on a tentacle does not harm you.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a 7th-level or higher spell slot, you grow an additional tentacle for each spell slot higher than 6th level.
