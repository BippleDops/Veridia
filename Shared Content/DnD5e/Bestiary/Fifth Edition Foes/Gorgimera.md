## Special Traits
**Dragon Breath:** The breath weapon used by a gorgimera's dragon head depends on the color of its dragon head, as listed on the table below. Regardless of its type, a gorgimera's breath weapon deals 13 (`dice: 3d8`) points of damage, or half damage to targets that make a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. To determine a gorgimera's head color and breath weapon randomly, roll `dice: 1d10` and consult the table.


| **`dice: 1d10`** | **Head Color** | **Breath Weapon** | **Damage** |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1-2 | Black | 40-foot line | acid |
| 3-4 | Blue | 40-foot line | lightning |
| 5-6 | Green | 20-foot cone | gas (acid) |
| 7-8 | Red | 20-foot cone | fire |
| 9-10 | White | 20-foot cone | cold |

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A gorgimera bites once, and attacks once with its horns and twice with claws. The horn attack can be replaced by gorgon breath, and the bite attack can be replaced by dragon breath.

**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 13 (`dice: 2d8+4`) piercing damage.

**Claw:*** Melee Attack*: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (`dice: 1d8+4`) slashing damage.

**Horns:** *Melee Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (`dice: 1d8+4`) bludgeoning damage.

**Dragon Breath (Recharge 5—6):** *Area Attack:* automatic hit, range varies, creatures in area. Hit: 13 (`dice: 3d8`) damage (type varies), or half damage with a successful DC 15 Dexterity saving throw.

**Gorgon Breath (Recharge 5—6):** *Area Attack:* automatic hit, range 30 ft. cone, creatures in cone. Hit: targets must make a successful DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be restrained as they begin turning to stone. A restrained creature attempts the saving throw again at the end of its next turn. If the second saving throw succeeds, the effect ends. If the second saving throw fails, the target is permanently petrified; a greater restoration spell can reverse the petrification.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate hills and mountains

**Organization**: Solitary or pair

## Description
A gorgimera is a chimerical creature with the heads of a lion, a dragon, and a gorgon. It has the hindquarters of a gorgon and the forequarters of a lion. A gorgimera’s dragon head can be that of any of the chromatic dragons. The lion head has no mane, and the scaled gorgon head is a deep navy blue with glowing red eyes.

These creatures are highly territorial predators, and their hunting range covers many square miles around their lairs. The creature makes its home inside deep caverns with openings atop high mountains. A typical lair contains a mated pair and one or two young.

A gorgimera prefers to attack from ambush or to plunge suddenly onto unsuspecting targets from high in the sky. It usually attacks by biting with its dragon head, butting with its gorgon head, and slashing with its leonine paws. The dragon and gorgon heads can also use their characteristic breath weapons.
