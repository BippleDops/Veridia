# Body Blades (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (two sharp pieces of metal) and a shard of bone.

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
Dagger-like growths grow out of your body, passing harmlessly through any clothing or armor you wear. You gain +1 AC. If you grapple anyone or are grappled, you do 2d4 + your spellcasting ability bonus in piercing damage.

The growths are metallic-looking but are not made of metal and cannot be affected by spells that affect metal.
