# Transportation Infrastructure

Macro-systems that make journeys strategic. Connects to economies, factions, and reality stability. Cross-links with [[Memory Trading Economy System|Memory Trading Economy]] and [[Complete Reality Merger System]].

## Aquabyssos Networks
- Pressure Tube Highways: City-to-city sealed tubes with adaptation checkpoints
- Parasite Beacons: Organic wayfinders; illegal in some districts
- Deep Current Rapid Transit: Ride boundary flows; schedule synced to tides
- Memory-Mapped Routes: Official chart repositories; black markets exist
- Adaptation Stations: AP certification, medical services
- Emergency Pressure Shelters: Bubble pods along routes; limited supplies

## Aethermoor Networks
- Crystal Resonance Flight Paths: Maintained frequencies; weather-integrated
- Wind Current Highways: Seasonal routes; migration aligned
- Gravity Wells: Rapid descent/ascent nodes; risky in storms
- Star-Navigation Anchors: Night-only precise lanes
- Height Transition Stations: Crew acclimation and maintenance
- Emergency Grounding Platforms: Storm refuges with anchor pylons

## Cross-World Connections
- Merger Portals: Scheduled flickers; faction-contested
- Reality Breach Points: Dangerous shortcuts; require anchors
- Dream-Sailing: Night crossings via mass lullaby; sanity costs
- Temporal Loops: Predictable shortcuts; paradox management required
- Deep Mother Passages: High risk/high reward; bargain mechanics

## Logistics & Control
- Faction Control of Routes: Tolling, patrols, piracy, and privateering
- Trade Lanes: Risk/Reward tables (see [[Journey_Event_Compiler]])
- Infrastructure Sabotage: Target anchors, beacons, stations to shift strategic balance
