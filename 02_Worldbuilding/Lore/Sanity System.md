# Sanity System

*When Reality Breaks, So Does the Mind*

## Overview

The Sanity System is an optional mechanic for campaigns featuring horror elements, reality distortion, and the psychological toll of confronting incomprehensible truths. In a world where shadow corruption warps reality, memory magic can rewrite identity, and the depths hide things that shouldn't exist, maintaining mental stability becomes as crucial as physical health.

This system tracks characters' psychological resilience through Sanity Points, a resource that depletes when encountering traumatic, horrifying, or reality-breaking events. Unlike physical damage that heals with rest, sanity damage requires time, therapy, and sometimes accepting that some truths can never be unlearned.

## Core Mechanics

### Sanity Points
Each character begins with Sanity Points equal to:
**Formula**: (Wisdom Score × 5) + Character Level + Background Modifier

**Background Modifiers**:
- **Soldier/Guard**: +5 (hardened by violence)
- **Scholar/Sage**: -5 (know too much)
- **Noble**: +0 (sheltered but fragile)
- **Criminal**: +3 (familiar with darkness)
- **Folk Hero**: +5 (grounded in simple truths)
- **Hermit**: -3 (isolation breeds strange thoughts)
- **Acolyte**: +2 (faith provides anchor)

### Sanity Saves
When encountering sanity-threatening situations:
**Save**: 1d20 + Wisdom modifier + Proficiency (if proficient in Wisdom saves)

**DC Examples**:
- DC 10: Witnessing brutal death
- DC 12: Seeing shadow corruption firsthand
- DC 15: Encountering aberrations or void creatures
- DC 18: Learning reality-breaking truths
- DC 20: Direct contact with [[Deep Mother]]'s dreams
- DC 25: Understanding the true nature of existence

### Sanity Damage
**Failed Save**: Lose sanity points based on severity
- Minor (DC 10-12): 1d4 sanity damage
- Moderate (DC 13-15): 1d6 sanity damage
- Major (DC 16-19): 1d8 sanity damage
- Severe (DC 20+): 1d10 sanity damage

## DM Guidance

### When to Use
Sanity system works best for:
- Horror and investigation campaigns
- Stories about corruption and transformation
- Exploring psychological themes
- Adding stakes beyond death

### When to Avoid
Skip sanity system if:
- Players uncomfortable with mental health themes
- Campaign is lighthearted
- Complex mechanics unwanted
- Focus on heroic fantasy

### Balancing Sanity
- Make restoration available but costly
- Balance horror with hope
- Allow player agency in madness
- Use as storytelling tool, not punishment

### Safety Tools
- Discuss boundaries before using
- Allow players to veto specific madness
- Provide content warnings
- Have alternative consequences ready

## Variant Rules

### Simplified System
Use only three states:
1. **Sane**: No effects
2. **Shaken**: Disadvantage on mental saves
3. **Mad**: Roll on madness table

### Corruption Integration
Link sanity to shadow corruption:
- Corruption damage also damages sanity
- Low sanity increases corruption vulnerability
- Madness and corruption create feedback loop

### Heroic Sanity
Characters are more resilient:
- Double starting sanity
- Advantage on all sanity saves
- Recover fully between adventures
- Madness is temporary flavor
