## Description

Marcus Blackwood was once a respected merchant's son until shadow corruption claimed his family's fortune and his soul. Now he operates as the Shade—Aethermoor's most dangerous criminal mastermind. His appearance shifts between his original form and something far more sinister: sometimes he appears as a handsome human with dark hair and piercing blue eyes, other times shadows writhe beneath his skin and his eyes become pools of absolute darkness.

Standing 6'1" with an athletic build, Marcus dresses impeccably in dark, expensive clothing that seems to absorb light. His most distinctive feature is how shadows bend toward him unnaturally, and how his reflection sometimes shows different expressions than his actual face.

He controls the Shadowmarket—a hidden bazaar where anything can be bought for the right price, including souls, memories, and forbidden knowledge. His network of informants, thieves, and corrupted officials spans both realms.

## Equipment

- **Twin Shadow Blades** (magical daggers that can phase between material and shadow)
- **Cloak of Shadowstep** (allows teleportation through shadows)
- **Ring of Mind Blank** (protects against divination magic)
- **Sending Stones Network** (connected to his criminal organization)
- **Blackmail Portfolio** (detailed records of secrets and compromising information)
- **Shadow Vault Key** (accesses his hidden treasury in the shadow plane)

## Relationships

**Allies:**
- **[[Shadow Parliament]]** - Primary faction, though he maintains independence
- **[[The Biomancers]]** - Occasional business partners for exotic goods
- **Corrupt Officials** - A network of bought politicians and guards across both realms

**Enemies:**
- **[[Sir Theron Crystalward]]** - The knight actively hunts him and his organization
- **[[The Crystal Guard]]** - Law enforcement that threatens his operations
- **[[High Priestess Celeste Dawnbringer]]** - Her purification efforts interfere with shadow magic

**Complicated:**
- **Lady Vivian Blackwood** - His sister who turned to the light and now opposes him
- **[[Vespara "Nightwhisper" Thorne]]** - Professional rival in the assassination business

## Quest Hooks

1. **The Shadow Auction** - Marcus is hosting a secret auction selling artifacts that could tip the balance of power. The party must infiltrate to stop dangerous items from falling into the wrong hands.

2. **Family Matters** - Marcus's sister has been kidnapped by his enemies. Despite their opposition, he needs help rescuing her—but can the party trust his motives?

3. **The Corruption Cure** - Marcus claims to have information about curing shadow corruption, but his price is eliminating three of his rivals. The party must decide if the ends justify the means.

4. **Shadow War** - Marcus's criminal empire is under attack from a rival organization. He offers valuable information in exchange for protection, forcing the party to choose sides in an underworld conflict.

5. **The Last Job** - Marcus wants to retire from crime but needs one final score to buy his freedom from his shadow patron. He offers the party a partnership that could make them rich—or damn their souls.

## Secrets

- **The Original Sin**: Marcus's family wasn't destroyed by random shadow corruption—he deliberately opened a portal to save their failing business, and the shadows consumed everyone but him.
- **The Twin Soul**: His sister Vivian shares a soul-bond with him. If one dies, the other gains their memories and some of their abilities.
- **The Shadow Master**: Marcus isn't the true leader of the Shadow Parliament—he serves a being from the Far Realm that whispers instructions through his shadow.
- **The Redemption Clause**: There is a way to cleanse his shadow corruption, but it requires him to sacrifice everything he's built and everyone he's corrupted.
- **The Royal Contract**: Marcus has a contract with a member of the royal family to eliminate political rivals, giving him protection from the highest levels.

## Motivations

**Primary**: Maintain and expand his criminal empire while avoiding the consequences of his past
**Secondary**: Find a way to break free from his shadow patron without losing his power
**Hidden**: Secretly seeks redemption but believes he's gone too far to ever deserve it

## Roleplaying Notes

**Personality**: Charming and sophisticated on the surface, with sudden flashes of cold ruthlessness. Never loses his temper but becomes dangerously quiet when angry.

**Ideals**: "Power is the only truth. Everything else—law, morality, love—is just another commodity to be bought, sold, or traded."

**Bonds**: "My sister is the last pure thing in my world. I'll do anything to keep her safe, even if she hates me for it."

**Flaws**: "I believe I can control any situation through manipulation and fear. My arrogance blinds me to genuine loyalty and friendship."

**Voice**: Smooth and cultured, with impeccable diction. Speaks softly, forcing others to lean in to hear him. Never raises his voice—when truly angry, he whispers.

**Speaking Patterns**: 
- "Let's discuss terms..."
- "I'm sure we can reach a mutually beneficial arrangement..."
- "Information is currency, and I deal in the rarest denominations..."
- "Everyone has a price. The only question is whether you're honest about what it is..."

**Mannerisms**: Always impeccably groomed. Has a habit of straightening his cufflinks when thinking. His shadow moves independently of his body when he's using magic. He never sits with his back to a door and always knows the location of every exit.
