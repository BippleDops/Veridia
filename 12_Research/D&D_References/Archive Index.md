## Archive Purpose

This archive preserves the vault's development history and provides rollback capability if needed. The content here represents previous iterations and cleanup artifacts that maintain the vault's historical record while keeping the main structure clean and organized.

## Maintenance

Archive contents should be reviewed periodically and older backups can be compressed further or moved to external storage as needed.
