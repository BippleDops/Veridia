# Crown of Tidal Sovereignty
*Symbol of Unity, Now Broken Like the Realm It Once Ruled*

## Overview
The Crown of Tidal Sovereignty once served as the ultimate symbol of unified rule over all Aquabyssos, incorporating fragments of [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards]] to grant its wearer unprecedented authority over the tidal forces that govern the realm. When [[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Scattered Emperor|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Scattered Emperor]] began fragmenting into multiple personalities, the crown responded by breaking into seven pieces, each piece bonding with a different aspect of his divided consciousness. Now scattered across the realm, the crown fragments represent both the potential for restored unity and the danger of absolute power falling into the wrong hands.
