Each crystal tree in this submarine forest contains a complete garden within its crystalline fruit, and each garden within contains more trees with more gardens, recursing into infinity. Visitors often spend lifetimes exploring a single branch, only to discover they've never left the entrance. ### The Primary Garden

The "outermost" layer spans roughly three square miles of seafloor, though measurements become meaningless here. Massive crystal trees grow from beds of prismatic coral, their branches heavy with fruit that contains entire worlds. **Crystal Tree Properties**:
- Height: 30-300 feet (simultaneously)
- Fruit: Each contains a complete garden 1/10th the size
- Roots: Extend into parallel dimensions
- Bark: Shows reflections of all possible versions of viewers ### The Fruit Worlds

Each crystalline fruit is a portal to a smaller but complete version of the garden. Time moves faster in deeper recursions:
- **Level 1**: 1 hour = 1 hour
- **Level 2**: 1 hour = 10 hours - **Level 3**: 1 hour = 100 hours
- **Level 4**: 1 hour = 1,000 hours
- **Level 5+**: Time becomes non-linear **Mechanical Effect**: Characters entering fruit worlds must make a **DC 15** WIS save or forget which level of reality they originated from. ### The Probability Flowerbeds

Flowers that bloom in all possible states simultaneously—budding, flowering, dying, and not-existing at once. Picking one collapses probability, potentially changing reality. **Probability Flower Effects** (Roll `dice: 1d12`):
1-2: Flower was never picked (action undone)
3-4: Flower becomes a different object entirely
5-6: Picker gains a memory of picking it before
7-8: Flower multiplies into `dice: 2d6` identical flowers
9-10: Flower grants vision of one possible future
11: Flower contains a tiny garden (new recursion)
12: Picker temporarily exists in all probable states ### The Fractal Fountain

At the garden's heart, an impossible fountain flows in all directions simultaneously—up, down, inward, and through dimensions. Its water is actually liquid mathematics, and drinking it allows comprehension of the garden's true nature. **Drinking Effects**:
- **Success** (**DC 20** INT save): Gain ability to navigate recursions, understand infinite mathematics
- **Failure**: Mind fragments across infinite possibilities, gain indefinite madness
- **Critical Failure**: Consciousness scattered across all garden levels ### The Gardener Recursions

The same gardener exists at every level of the garden, each a smaller or larger version, all working in perfect synchronization. They claim to be one entity experiencing infinite perspectives simultaneously. **The Infinite Gardener** (CR Variable)
- Exists at all CR levels simultaneously (CR 1 through CR 20)
- Can attack from multiple reality levels at once
- Immune to damage unless hit in all recursions simultaneously ### Nested Civilizations

Entire civilizations exist within the fruit worlds, unaware they're inside a garden inside a garden. Some have developed technology to travel between recursion levels, creating complex trade routes through dimensional layers. **Notable Nested Cultures**:
- **The Mote Empire**: Rules 17 levels deep, trades in compressed space
- **The Ascending Monks**: Attempting to reach the "true" reality
- **The Recursive Raiders**: Pirates who raid across dimensional scales ### Probability Sprites

Beings that exist in quantum superposition, experiencing all possible versions of themselves. They speak in overlapping voices, each stating different truths. ### Size Paradoxes

Characters can encounter themselves from other recursion levels:
- Meet a giant version from an upper level
- Encounter a microscopic version from a deeper level
- Find their own corpse from a failed timeline ### Navigation Challenges **Getting Lost** (Roll `dice: 1d20`):

- 1-5: Move one recursion deeper without realizing
- 6-10: Exit into the wrong level's version of the garden
- 11-15: Temporarily exist in multiple levels
- 16-19: Successfully navigate
- 20: Discover shortcut between non-adjacent levels ### "The Lost Expedition"

A research team entered the garden years ago but from their perspective, centuries have passed in the deeper recursions. They've built a civilization and forgotten the outside world exists. ### "The Reality Virus"

Something is causing the recursions to collapse into each other. Gardens are merging, creating impossible overlaps where multiple scales exist simultaneously. ### "The Original Seed"

Legend speaks of the seed that grew the first crystal tree. Finding it might grant power over all recursions—or destroy them all. ### "The Recursive War"

Two civilizations from different recursion levels have declared war, not realizing they're fighting across dimensional scales. The party must broker peace or choose a side. ### The Infinity Market

A market that exists in all recursions simultaneously. Traders can buy from their past selves and sell to their future selves, creating temporal economic loops. ### Recursion Sickness

Spending too long jumping between levels causes existential vertigo:
- **Stage 1**: Confusion about current size/level
- **Stage 2**: Seeing multiple recursions simultaneously - **Stage 3**: Consciousness splits across levels
- **Stage 4**: Become part of the garden's recursive loop ### The Collapse Points

Areas where recursions intersect incorrectly, creating:
- Gravity that pulls in multiple directions
- Time flowing at different rates in the same space
- Objects that are simultaneously huge and tiny
- Conversations with yourself across scales ### The Infinite Recursion Campaign

The garden serves as the central location for reality-bending adventures where players question the nature of existence and explore infinite possibilities. ### Connection to Aethermoor

During convergence events, Aethermoor's crystal formations begin showing recursive properties, with tiny kingdoms discovered inside crystal plague victims. ### The Depth Mother Connection

Some theorize the entire garden is just one scale of an even larger recursion—perhaps Aquabyssos itself is a fruit in an unimaginably vast garden. ### Memorable Encounters

- Fight the same enemy at multiple scales simultaneously
- Negotiate with a civilization inside the party's water bottle
- Race against time as it moves differently per level
- Discover the party's actions in one level affect all others --- *"I've spent three lifetimes mapping the garden, only to discover I've never left the shadow of the first tree. The infinite is not just vast—it's intimate, existing in every scale simultaneously."*

— Explorer's log, recursion level unknown ## Player-Facing Summary The Infinite Garden is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Infinite Garden as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Infinite Garden. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Alliance - Manipulate succession ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The First Prophecy of Stars ## Plot Hooks - Someone is blackmailing information for love
