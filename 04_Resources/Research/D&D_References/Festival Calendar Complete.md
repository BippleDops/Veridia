Understanding this calendar helps characters navigate social expectations, plan activities around community events, and participate meaningfully in the cultural life of both realms. ## Lore Details The development of a unified festival calendar represents one of the most successful examples of inter-realm cultural cooperation. Originally, each realm maintained completely separate celebration schedules based on their unique environmental and cultural needs. The creation of the Convergence Calendar required extensive negotiation and cultural innovation, ultimately producing a system that honors both traditional celebrations while creating new opportunities for unity and understanding. Many festivals have evolved significantly from their original forms, adapting to include cross-cultural participation while maintaining their essential cultural and spiritual significance. The calendar reflects not just the celebration of traditions, but the living evolution of culture as different communities interact and influence each other. ## DM Notes Use the festival calendar as a framework for creating regular community events that provide opportunities for character development, cultural learning, and community integration. Festivals can serve as excellent backdrops for adventures, providing natural gathering points for NPCs, opportunities for social interaction, and contexts for both celebration and conflict. Consider how festival timing might affect other campaign elements - trade routes might be busier during certain festivals, political meetings might be scheduled around celebration seasons, and different festivals might provide cover for various types of activities both legitimate and illicit. The extensive festival calendar also provides natural campaign pacing, with seasonal celebrations marking the passage of time and providing regular opportunities for characters to engage with community life and cultural traditions. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Related Notes - [Similar Topic 1]]
