## Overview
The [[Order of the Drowned Star]] has developed a horrifying weapon called the "Grief Bomb" - a crystalline device that forces entire populations to experience profound, paralyzing sorrow. Intelligence suggests it's hidden somewhere in the [[Abyssos Prime - Inverse Palace]], designed to be detonated during a major political gathering to cripple [[Aquabyssos]]'s leadership permanently.

## Background
[[High Inquisitor Maltheos]] discovered plans for the Grief Bomb in captured [[Shadow Surgeons Collective]] documents. The weapon works by amplifying traumatic memories and projecting them into the minds of everyone within a 2-mile radius. Victims become catatonic with grief, reliving their worst losses on an endless loop.

## Key NPCs
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Anti-Priest Nullus]]**: Fanatical creator of the Grief Bomb, believes suffering purifies
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Memory Merchant Zephyr Mindweaver]]**: Has crucial intelligence about memory-based weapons

- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/High Inquisitor Maltheos]]**: Lead investigator who discovered the plot
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Palace Guard Captain Ironclad]]**: Security expert coordinating palace defenses

## Investigation Phases

### Phase 1: Gathering Intelligence (1 session)

**Clues to Find:**

2. **Memory Harvesting Equipment**: Strange surgical tools found in raids
3. **Timeline Anomalies**: Temporal distortions around the palace suggest active magic
4. **Emotional Residue**: Psychic investigators detect "grief shadows" in certain areas

### Phase 2: The Palace Infiltration (1-2 sessions)
**Location:** [[Abyssos Prime - Inverse Palace]]  
**Objective:** Navigate the twisted architecture to locate the bomb

**Challenges:**
- **Inverted Gravity**: Rooms where "down" points in different directions

### Phase 3: The Confrontation (1 session)
**Location:** [[The Original Palace]] (accessed through reality tears)  
**Objective:** Stop [[Anti-Priest Nullus]] from activating the Grief Bomb

- **Memory Amplification**: Traumatic memories feel fresh and overwhelming
- **Emotional Contagion**: The grief spreads to anyone who interacts with victims
- **Despair Aura**: Hope becomes literally impossible to feel

2. **Memory healing magic** to repair fractured emotional channels

#### Special Abilities
**Grief Aura.** All creatures within 30 feet of Nullus have disadvantage on saving throws against fear and charm effects. Additionally, any creature that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be overwhelmed with sorrow, reducing their movement speed by half until the start of their next turn.

**Sorrow Empowerment.** Nullus gains power from others' suffering. For each creature within 60 feet that is frightened, charmed, or has been reduced to half hit points or fewer, Nullus gains +1 to attack rolls, damage rolls, and spell save DCs (maximum +5).

**Despair Shield.** While any creature within 60 feet is frightened or charmed, Nullus takes half damage from all sources and has advantage on concentration saving throws.

**Memory Sight.** Nullus can see the most traumatic memories of any creature he can see, giving him insight into their greatest fears and losses. This grants him advantage on Insight checks and allows him to target specific emotional vulnerabilities.

#### Actions
**Multiattack.** Nullus makes two Sorrow Spike attacks or casts two spells of 3rd level or lower.

**Sorrow Spike.** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +11 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 18 (2d10 + 7) psychic damage. The target must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On failure, they are stunned until the end of their next turn as they relive their most traumatic memory in vivid detail.

**Manifestation of Regret (Recharge 5-6).** Nullus creates illusory manifestations of the party's greatest regrets and losses. Each creature within 60 feet must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On failure: 27 (6d8) psychic damage and the creature is frightened for 1 minute (can repeat save at end of each turn). On success: Half damage and not frightened.

**Activate Grief Bomb (1/Day).** If Nullus is within 30 feet of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Items/Grief Bomb]], he can spend his action to begin activating it. This requires 3 consecutive rounds of concentration. If successful, the bomb detonates (see Grief Bomb effects). The activation can be interrupted by breaking his concentration or moving him more than 30 feet from the device.

**Emotional Vampire (3/Day).** Nullus drains the emotional energy from a creature within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 19 Charisma saving throw. On failure, the target takes 22 (4d10) necrotic damage and Nullus regains the same amount as hit points. The target's maximum hit points are reduced by half the damage taken.

**Final Grief (When reduced to 0 hp).** Nullus triggers a localized grief bomb explosion. All creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by intense grief for 24 hours (as per the *confusion* spell, but the creature can only take the "do nothing but weep" action).

#### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)
**Move.** Nullus moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
**Sorrow Strike.** Nullus makes one Sorrow Spike attack.
**Cast Spell (Costs 2 Actions).** Nullus casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.
**Empathic Assault (Costs 3 Actions).** Nullus targets one creature within 60 feet with concentrated emotional manipulation. The target must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the end of their next turn and take 13 (3d8) psychic damage.

#### Spellcasting
Nullus is a 14th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit). He knows the following spells:

- **Cantrips (at will):** *guidance*, *resistance*, *thaumaturgy*, *toll the dead*
- **1st level (4 slots):** *bane*, *cause fear*, *inflict wounds*  
- **2nd level (3 slots):** *detect thoughts*, *hold person*, *suggestion*
- **3rd level (3 slots):** *bestow curse*, *fear*, *speak with dead*
- **4th level (3 slots):** *confusion*, *locate creature*, *polymorph*
- **5th level (3 slots):** *dominate person*, *modify memory*, *scrying*
- **6th level (1 slot):** *harm*, *mass suggestion*
- **7th level (1 slot):** *plane shift*, *reverse gravity*

#### Equipment
- **Robes of Eternal Sorrow**: AS 17, grants immunity to fear and charm while attuned
- **Staff of Memory Drain**: +2 spellcasting focus that can store extracted memories
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/Items/Grief Bomb]] Activation Crystal**: Allows remote activation of the device
- **Vial of Concentrated Despair**: Can be thrown to create a 20-foot radius area of magical despair
- **Memory Extraction Tools**: Surgical implements for harvesting traumatic experiences

**Tactics:** Nullus focuses on emotional manipulation and psychological warfare rather than direct damage. He attempts to activate the [[02_Worldbuilding/Items/Grief Bomb]] while using the party's own memories and regrets against them. He prioritizes spellcasters and leaders, seeking to break their will through targeted emotional attacks.

> [!danger] DM Secret
> The Grief Bomb contains a fragment of [[The Deep Mother]]'s consciousness, making it partially sentient and capable of adaptive tactics. It "learns" from each attempt to defuse it, becoming harder to stop with repeated failure.
