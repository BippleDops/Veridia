*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 70* **Tragedies**`dice: [](secondary-tables-tragedies-xge.md#^tragedies)`| dice: d12 | Tragedy |
|-----------|---------|
| 1-2 | A family member or a close friend died. Roll on the Cause of Death supplemental table to find out how. |
| 3 | A friendship ended bitterly, and the other person is now hostile to you. The cause might have been a misunderstanding or something you or the former friend did. |
| 4 | You lost all your possessions in a disaster, and you had to rebuild your life. |
| 5 | You were imprisoned for a crime you didn't commit and spent`d6`years at hard labor, in jail, or shackled to an oar in a slave galley. |
| 6 | War ravaged your home community, reducing everything to rubble and ruin. In the aftermath, you either helped your town rebuild or moved somewhere else. |
| 7 | A lover disappeared without a trace. You have been looking for that person ever since. |
| 8 | A terrible blight in your home community caused crops to fail, and many starved. You lost a sibling or some other family member. |
| 9 | You did something that brought terrible shame to you in the eyes of your family. You might have been involved in a scandal, dabbled in dark magic, or offended someone important. The attitude of your family members toward you becomes indifferent at best, though they might eventually forgive you. |
| 10 | For a reason you were never told, you were exiled from your community. You then either wandered in the wilderness for a time or promptly found a new place to live. |
| 11 | A romantic relationship ended. Roll a`d6`. An odd number means it ended with bad feelings, while an even number means it ended amicably. |
| 12 | A current or prospective romantic partner of yours died. Roll on the Cause of Death supplemental table to find out how. If the result is murder, roll a`d12`. On a 1, you were responsible, whether directly or indirectly. |
