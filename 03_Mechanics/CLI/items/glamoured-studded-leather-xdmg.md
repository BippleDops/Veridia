# Glamoured Studded Leather
*Light armor ([studded leather armor](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/studded-leather-armor-xphb.md)), rare*  


- **Armor Class**: 12 + Dex modifier
- **Weight**: 13.0 lbs.

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to [Armor Class](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/armor-class-xphb.md). You can also take a [Bonus Action](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md) to cause the armor to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of armor. You decide what it looks like—including color, style, and accessories—but the armor retains its normal bulk and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or doff the armor.
