You can use any weapon you summon with your Pact of the Blade feature as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

In addition, the weapon gains a +1 bonus to its attack and damage rolls, unless it is a magic weapon that already has a bonus to those rolls.

Finally, the weapon you conjure can be a [[shortbow xphb|shortbow]], [[longbow xphb|longbow]], [[light crossbow xphb|light crossbow]], or [[heavy crossbow xphb|heavy crossbow]].
