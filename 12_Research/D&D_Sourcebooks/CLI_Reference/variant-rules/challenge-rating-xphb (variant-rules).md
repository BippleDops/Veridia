--- # Challenge Rating

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 363. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* Challenge Rating (CR) summarizes the threat a [[Charm Monster Xphb]] poses to a group of four [[Player Character Xphb]]. Compare a [[Charm Monster Xphb]] CR to the characters' level. If the CR is higher, the [[Charm Monster Xphb]] is likely a danger. If the CR is lower, the [[Charm Monster Xphb]] likely poses little threat. But circumstances and the number of [[Player Character Xphb]] can significantly alter how threatening a [[Charm Monster Xphb]] is in actual play. The "Dungeon Master's Guide" provides guidance to the DM on using CR while planning potential combat [[Encounter Xphb]]. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Challenge rating xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of challenge rating xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around challenge rating xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[1 How to Use a Monster]]
