# TIMELINE FIXES REPORT
*Documentation of All Temporal Inconsistency Corrections*

## Overview

This report documents all temporal inconsistencies found during the comprehensive timeline validation and the corrections made to establish canonical continuity. The validation revealed a fundamental conflict between two different historical narratives that needed resolution.

---

## MAJOR INCONSISTENCY DISCOVERED

### The Core Timeline Conflict

Two incompatible historical narratives were found in the vault:

#### **Narrative A: "Great Drowning Timeline" (CANONICAL)**
- **Event**: The Great Drowning/Convergence
- **Date**: 1247 years ago (1 PD → 1247 AE)
- **Nature**: Surface civilization was drowned and merged with underwater realm
- **Source Files**: Great Drowning.md, Shadow Conspiracy Timeline.md, Crystal Plague Origins.md, Parliamentary Founding.md, Post-Merge Chronology.md

#### **Narrative B: "Sundering Timeline" (INCORRECT)**
- **Event**: The Sundering
- **Date**: 300 years ago
- **Nature**: Unified world was magically split into two separate realms
- **Source Files**: Player guides, Quick Start materials, World Primer

### Resolution Decision

**CANONICAL TIMELINE ADOPTED**: The "Great Drowning Timeline" (Narrative A) has been established as canonical because:

1. **More Detailed Documentation**: Extensive historical records with specific dates and events
2. **Character Integration**: Characters with established histories that align with this timeline
3. **Causal Relationships**: Complex cause-effect chains that span centuries
4. **World-Building Depth**: Rich historical development across multiple eras
5. **Mechanical Integration**: Game mechanics built around depth adaptation and post-convergence society

---

## FILES CORRECTED

### 1. World_Bible_Index.md

**INCONSISTENCY FOUND**:
```
1. **900 years ago**: The Great Drowning
2. **500 years ago**: First inter-realm contact  
3. **100 years ago**: Trade treaties established
```

**CORRECTION APPLIED**:
```
1. **1247 years ago (1 PD)**: The Great Drowning/Convergence
2. **1159 years ago (89 AE)**: First inter-realm exploration begins
3. **100 years ago (1147 AE)**: Modern trade treaties established
```

**RATIONALE**: Updated to match canonical timeline where Great Drowning occurred 1247 years ago, not 900.

### 2. Quick_Start_Guide.md

**INCONSISTENCY FOUND**:
```
- **Two Worlds**: Aquabyssos (underwater empire) and Aethermoor (surface world) were separated 300 years ago
```

**CORRECTION APPLIED**:
```
- **Two Worlds**: Aquabyssos (underwater empire) integrated with Aethermoor (sky realm) after the Great Convergence 1247 years ago
```

**RATIONALE**: Corrected fundamental historical premise to match canonical merger rather than separation.

### 3. World_Primer.md

**INCONSISTENCY FOUND**:
```
Three hundred years ago, Aquabyssos and Aethermoor were one world—a realm where sky touched sea, where floating cities drifted above coral palaces, where humans lived both above and below the waves in harmony.

### The Sundering Event
The exact cause remains debated, lost in propaganda and fractured memories. What's known:
- A catastrophic magical event separated the worlds
- The Surface Seal formed, an impenetrable barrier
```

**CORRECTION APPLIED**:
```
Over twelve centuries ago, surface civilization and the sky realm of Aethermoor existed separately until the Great Convergence merged them into the unified underwater realm of Aquabyssos.

### The Great Convergence
The dimensional merger that created modern Aquabyssos is well-documented. What happened:
- Surface world and Aethermoor were pulled into oceanic space
- Reality merged creating breathable underwater environment
- Survivors adapted through biological and magical transformation
```

**RATIONALE**: Completely revised to match canonical convergence narrative rather than separation narrative.

### 4. Master_Lore_Index.md

**INCONSISTENCY FOUND**:
```
- **Era**: Pre-Drowning (1000+ years ago)
- **Era**: The Transition (500 years ago)
- **Era**: Post-Drowning (400 years ago)
- **Era**: Medieval Period (300 years ago)
- **Era**: Recent Past (50-20 years ago)
```

**CORRECTION APPLIED**:
```
- **Era**: Pre-Drowning (1247+ years ago)
- **Era**: The Adaptation Era (1-156 AE, ~1247-1091 years ago)
- **Era**: The Expansion Era (157-445 AE, ~1090-802 years ago)
- **Era**: The Modern Era (446-1247 AE, ~801 years ago-present)
- **Era**: Contemporary Period (1100-1247 AE, ~147 years ago-present)
```

**RATIONALE**: Updated all era references to align with canonical AE dating system.

### 5. Campaign_Relationship_Matrix.md

**INCONSISTENCY FOUND**:
```
**Immediate Impacts (500 years ago):**
**Historical Fragmentation (300 years ago):**
**Reform Period (50-20 years ago):**
```

**CORRECTION APPLIED**:
```
**Post-Convergence Adaptation (1247-1091 years ago / 1-156 AE):**
**Expansion Period (1090-802 years ago / 157-445 AE):**
**Modern Era Developments (801 years ago-present / 446-1247 AE):**
```

**RATIONALE**: Restructured to match canonical era divisions with proper AE dating.
