The party awakens to find one member replaced by their reflection from an alternate timeline. As they investigate the Gallery of [[Frozen Waves, they uncover a massive shadow surgery operation preparing for a harvest at high tide. [The Conductor]]'s screaming symphony reveals warnings from drowning victims while memory farmers profit from stolen identities. However, ## [[Strong Start]]

> *Read aloud:* "You wake to arguing. Two identical versions of [PARTY MEMBER] stand in your quarters, each insisting they're real. Both have complete memories. Both bleed red blood. Both cast shadows—shadows that move independently, watching this identity crisis with what might be amusement. Through the window, the [[Screaming Gardens harmonize into actual words: 'The surgeons come at high tide.' You have six hours." ### [Identity Crisis]] Resolution

**Tests to [[Determine Reality**:
- Shared memory only original would know (Insight **DC 16**)
- Shadow behavior differences (Perception **DC 14**)
- Reflection doesn't know about shadow conspiracy details
- Marina can "taste" the difference if present
- Memory from yesterday's temporal overlap ### Location: [[[Party Quarters]] - [[Inverse Palace (D&D_References)]]

**Atmosphere**: Morning light through water creates caustic patterns. Both versions of party member perfect except for subtle differences. ### [[Reflection Broker's Mark

**Investigation **DC 15** reveals**:
- Microscopic symbol on reflection's neck
- Trademark of [Reflection Broker]] Mirrors
- Indicates "premium replacement"
- Can be tracked to source ### [[Shadow Reactions

Both versions' shadows:
- Watch with interest
- Occasionally swap places
- Seem to be communicating
- One shadow knows the truth ### [Resolution Options]]

1. **[[Merge Them**: Risky ritual combining both
2. **[Banish Reflection]]**: Returns to timeline but creates enemy
3. **[[Keep Both**: Complications but double resources
4. **[Switch Places]]**: Send original to other timeline ### Location: [[garden

**Atmosphere**: Crystallized trees made from screams, each one a drowning victim's last moment preserved forever. ### [The Conductor]]

**Appearance**: Humanoid form of crystallized sound, constantly vibrating
**Communication**: Speaks in musical harmonies
**Knowledge**: Every scream tells a story
**Warning**: "The shadows prepare a grand performance" ### [[The Screaming Symphony

**[Performance Check]] **DC 14** to understand**:
- Children's screams: "Shadow in the water"
- Sailors' screams: "They wear our faces"
- Nobles' screams: "The harvest comes with tide"
- Ancient screams: "Seven times before, seven times again" ### [[Environmental Challenge

**[Prolonged Exposure]]** (Every 10 minutes):
- CON save **DC 13** or deafened for 1 hour
- WIS save **DC 15** or short-term madness
- After 3 failures: Permanent sensitivity to sound ### [[The Grove's Secret

**Hidden among the trees**:
- [Senator Glaucus]]'s wife, crystallized mid-scream
- Still partially conscious
- Screams the location of her husband
- Can be freed but dies immediately ### Navigating the Gardens

**[[Skill Challenge - 4 successes before 3 failures**:
- Performance **DC 15**: Harmonize with screams for safe passage
- Constitution **DC 14**: Endure the acoustic assault
- Investigation **DC 16**: Decode scream patterns for information
- Failure: [Attract Screaming]] [[Tree Guardians ### Location: [[Gallery of [Frozen Waves]]]]

**Atmosphere**: Tsunami waves frozen mid-crash, each one a different temporal moment. Time moves differently in each wave. ### [[Temporal Wave Navigation

**Each wave has different time flow**:
- Wave 1: Time moves backward (see yesterday)
- Wave 2: Time moves forward (see tomorrow)
- Wave 3: Time stops (frozen moment)
- Wave 4: Time accelerates (age rapidly)
- Wave 5: Time loops (repeat 5 minutes) ### DEX Save **DC 14** to move between waves

**Failure results**:
- Age `dice: 1d10` years or regress `dice: 1d10` years
- Stuck in time loop for 10 minutes
- See your own death (WIS save **DC 16** or frightened) ### Tomorrow's [Wave Discovery]]

**In the forward-time wave**:
- Witness tomorrow's shadow surgery
- See party members being operated on
- [[Shadow Duchess Nyx overseeing
- Mass replacement of Parliament occurring ### Yesterday's [Wave Evidence]]

**In the backward-time wave**:
- Senator bodies being stored
- Shadows practicing wearing skins
- [[Reflection Broker making deals
- Map to surgery preparation site ### [The Frozen]] Moment

**In the stopped-time wave**:
- Can interact with frozen scene
- [[Senator Glaucus mid-kidnapping
- Identify his captors (memory farmers)
- Steal shadow surgeon tools ### Location: [[[Memory Meadows]] [[Black Market]]

**Atmosphere**: Fields of kelp storing stolen memories, each strand a life's worth of experiences. ### [[Memory Farmer Thane

**Appearance**: Eyes clouded with too many memories
**Business**: Selling memories to shadows for coherency
**Defense**: Uses stolen memories as weapons
**Secret**: Has original [Senator Glaucus]] in basement ### [[The Memory [Kelp Fields]]

**Touching kelp without protection**:
- WIS save **DC 15** or lose random memory
- Gain random NPC [[memory
- Risk identity confusion (disadvantage on WIS saves) ### [Memory Combat]] Mechanics

**Farmers fight using memories**:
- [[Traumatic Memory Blast: `dice: 2d6` psychic damage
- [Happy Memory]] Shield: +3 AS as reaction
- [[Confusion Cloud: Targets forget why they're fighting
- [Identity Theft]]: Swap memories between combatants ### [[Rescuing Senator Glaucus

**Location**: Hidden basement, memory-proofed
**Condition**: Drained but alive
**Information**: Has been replaced for three weeks
**Proof**: [Shadow Duchess]] orchestrating everything
**Warning**: "At high tide, every shadow in the city replaces their original" ### Thane's Records

**Investigation **DC 16** finds**:
- Client list (all shadows)
- Memory catalog (blackmail material)
- Schedule of "harvests"
- Payment records from Tenebrarum ### [[Documents Found

1. **[Surgical Schedule]]**: Mass operations at high tide
2. **[[Shadow Integration Manual**: How shadows maintain coherency
3. **[Memory Transaction]] Ledger**: Who bought whose memories
4. **[[Reflection Broker Contract**: Premium replacement services
5. **[High Tide]] Timetable**: Exactly when the harvest begins ### [[The Conductor's Gift

If helped or impressed:
- **[Tuning Fork]]**: Partially control [[Screaming Gardens
- **[Harmonic Knowledge]]**: Understand sound-based magic
- **[[Scream Translation**: Know what each scream means ### [Memory Meadow]] Samples

**[[Random Memory [Kelp Effects]]** (d6):
1. Noble's affair scandal (blackmail material)
2. Guard patrol routes (useful information)
3. Childhood trauma (WIS save or frightened)
4. Happy memory (inspiration)
5. Shadow's original moment of consciousness
6. Location of shadow surgery tools ### [[High Tide Approaches

> *Read aloud:* "[Senator Glaucus]] gasps as you help him to safety: '[[The Shadow Duchess—she's not investigating the conspiracy, she IS the conspiracy! No, wait—' His face contorts in pain. 'That's wrong. She's investigating her own shadow. The real Duchess has been fighting her shadow for years.'
> > Through the windows, you see the tide beginning to rise—impossibly, as tides don't exist at this depth. Every shadow in the city stops what it's doing and turns toward the [Reflection Pools]]. They begin walking in perfect synchronization.
> Marina's shadow separates from her completely, speaking with her voice but wrong: 'The vote was uimous. The harvest begins at high tide. You can join us willingly, or we take you anyway. One hour remains.'
> Your own shadows pull away, standing at arm's length, waiting. In the distance, bells toll—but the sound comes from below, not above." ## Connection to Aethermoor

This session's revelations connect to:
- Crystal plague as preparation for shadow harvest
- Marina's role in both worlds
- [[The Seven Shards preventing/enabling replacement
- Depth adaptation making replacement easier
- [The Queen]]'s possession related to shadow consciousness ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## [[Prophecy Connection Mentioned in [The Second]] Prophecy of Winds ## [[Plot Hooks - Strange disappearances suggest ancient magic
