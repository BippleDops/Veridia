# Sand Shroud (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a lump of dried mud or clay, which is crumbled during the cast-ing)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
Sand or loose soil or gravel opens up un-der an non-living, inanimate object that is Large-sized or smaller and swallows it up instantly, burying it to a depth of 60 feet. The ground above it looks completely undis-turbed.

You may also cast this spell on an undead or construct. The creature may make a Dex-terity saving throw to avoid being buried. If it fails its roll, it is buried, but can dig its way out eventually.
