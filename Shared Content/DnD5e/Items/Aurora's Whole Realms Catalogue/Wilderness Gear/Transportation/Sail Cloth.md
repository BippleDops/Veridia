## Description
Since the opening of the magnificent shores of Maztica, sailcloth has become a critical commodity. After a hundred voyages to the golden lands, we have learned what material best withstands the rigors of sun and rain, the sea and its thousand leviathansâ€”even the torches of generals like Cordell! We offer that double-thick, [[Clay|clay]]-steeped sailcloth in 15-yard widths at a price of 1 gp/sq yd.
