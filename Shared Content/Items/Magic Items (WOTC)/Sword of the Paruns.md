## Description

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, once on each of your turns, you can use one of the following properties if you're holding the sword:
 
- Immediately after you use the [[Attack]] action to attack with the sword, you can enable one creature within 60 feet of you to use its reaction to make one weapon attack.

- Immediately after you take the [[Dash]] action, you can enable one creature within 60 feet of you to use its reaction to move up to its speed.

- Immediately after you take the [[Dodge]] action, you can enable one creature within 60 feet of you to use its reaction to gain the benefits of the [[Dodge]] action.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
