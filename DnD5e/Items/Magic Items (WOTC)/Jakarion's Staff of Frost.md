# Jakarion's Staff of Frost

## Description

You have resistance to cold damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [[cone of cold]] (5 charges), [[fog cloud]] (1 charge), [[ice storm]]) (4 charges), or [[wall of ice]] (4 charges).

The staff regains `dice: 1d6+4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a `dice: d20`. On a 1. the staff turns to water and is destroyed
Imprinted on this staff is a fragment of a dead wizard's personality. The first character who touches the staff gains the following flaw: "I crave power above all else, and will do anything to obtain more of it." This flaw trumps any conflicting personality trait.

**Versatile.** This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the propertyâ€”the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.
