# Suspended Cauldron
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 97*  

An iron pot is suspended so that it can be tipped easily, spilling its contents. Once emptied, a cauldron must be refilled before it can be used again. Filling the cauldron requires three [Utilize](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Utilize) actions. Then a crew member can take the Spill action.

Cauldrons are typically filled with boiling oil but can be filled with other substances, such as acid or [green slime](/03_Mechanics/CLI/traps-hazards/green-slime-xdmg.md) (see ""Hazards""), with different effects.
