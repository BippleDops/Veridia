*Source: Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes p. 104* - **Alignment**: Neutral
- **Domains**: Trickery
- **Pantheon**: Halfling
- **Province**: Adventure, thievery
- **Symbol**: Halfling footprint Dashing trickster, patron of thieves, and star of fantastical fables and wild stories of adventure-that's the legacy of Brandobaris, the Master of Stealth. Stories of Brandobaris, full of artful trickery and narrow escapes, inspire many young halflings to play at roguish pursuits. In their imagination, a grain silo becomes a lofty wizard's tower to scale in search of treasures, or a rowboat becomes the setting for a swashbuckling adventure. And for someâ€”the youngsters who are said to "have a bit of Brandobaris in them"â€”that play-acting is the prelude to a life of living as Brandobaris does: always on the lookout for the next challenge. Brandobaris continues to wander in search of excitement, and now, as an ascended being, his travels span the planes of existence. His curiosity takes him to all corners of the multiverse in search of magical curios, rare treasures, and mystical puzzles. When Brandobaris moves stealthily, no mortal or god can hear his footfalls-an ability he uses not only for defense, but also to bestow unlooked-for treats upon those he favors. Although he never seems to rest in his travels, Brandobaris always has time to reward halflings who dare to take risks and explore the world to make their own mark on it. He has been known to give a bit of aid to halflings in dire straits, turning them invisible for a time or intervening so that they can't be heard or tracked. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Halfling brandobaris mtf is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
