These maritime highways carry everything from essential supplies to forbidden luxuries, controlled by powerful [[Merchant_Guilds|Merchant Guilds, criminal syndicates, and independent operators willing to brave the dangers for massive profits.

## Lore Details

Ancient mariners speak of golden currents that flow between the realms, carrying not just cargo but destiny itself.

The routes themselves seem to have consciousness, responding to the ambitions of those who traverse them. Successful merchants report an almost mystical connection to their chosen paths, while those who abuse the trade winds find themselves cursed with perpetual misfortune, their vessels forever drawn off course by currents that lead only to ruin.
