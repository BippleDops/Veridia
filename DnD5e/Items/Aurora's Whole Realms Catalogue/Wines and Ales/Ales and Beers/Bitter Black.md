## Description
This hearty stout from Arabel is one of that cityâ€™s major exports, and deservedly so. Best served at cellar temperature (Arabellans sniff at any other way of serving this drink), the stout is heavy and is jet black with a dark brown head of foam. Hand keg, 3 sp; cask, 2 gp; barrel, 5 gp; butt, 15 gp; tun, 30 gp.
