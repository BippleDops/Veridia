## Description
An origami warrior is a magical creation made of intricately folded paper with the shape and size of a humanoid warrior. They can be made to resemble any type of humanoid, but humans and elves are the most common. Except in dim light or darkness, however, no one would ever mistake an origami warrior for a living creature. They are flat and angular, just like the small paper sculptures they’re named for. They range from very simplistic in their structure to tremendously complex and intricate, but all have the same statistics.

The magic for creating origami warriors is not widely known, but it doesn’t seem much of a leap from making origami creatures that resemble humans to making origami trolls, ogres, bulettes, or even dragons. Somewhere, an ambitious or curious wizard undoubtedly is working on that, if it hasn’t been done already.

Like most constructs, origami warriors have limited autonomy. They wait for orders from their creators, then follow those orders narrowly and to the letter, but also patiently and for as long as they survive.

A “typical” origami warrior is armed with a longsword, but they can be given any weapon. The only restriction is that their creator must be able to fold paper into the appropriate shape.
