# 1 - The Entrance
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!INFO]+ Callout
> Evinrood has the treasure, and the Delvers get the shaft.

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The entrance to the Tomb ofEvinrood is located on a grim, dark moor overlooking the sea. Soaring sea birds seem to cry his lament, as well as a forlorn warning to the advancing party of delvers.
> 
> The actual location is marked by a large graven capstone set almost flush to the ground, in a collar ring of stone work. On the surface of the capstone is a message, carved so long ago that the letters have faded almost to illegibility. With care the carving becomes clear:

> [!QUOTE]+ Read-Aloud
> *This is the last resting place of EVINROOD the Water Wizard*
> 
> *He did battle with Selgolub the Master of Daemons*
> 
> *In the year of the Bitter Wyvern, Sixth year of the Reign of the Death Empress*
> 
> *He failed to overthrow the daemon lord and was Accursed*
> 
> *EVIN ROOD, Savior of Karthaki.friend of the dwarves, and kobolds*
> 
> *MASTER OF THE ELEMENTS THEMSELVES*
> 
> *Rests herein with his great treasure disturb them at your peril*

> [!QUOTE]+ Read-Aloud
> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> If the promise of treasure and what is clearly an undisturbed Tomb complex doesn't inspire your prospective victims they are in the wrong line of work. So it is without further ado I submit for your approval the first trap. (Being as it is, before the party actually enters the Tomb, this will serve to separate the sheep from the goats in any party of delvers.)
