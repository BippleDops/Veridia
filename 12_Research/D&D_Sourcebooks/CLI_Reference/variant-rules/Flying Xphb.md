# Flying
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 367. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A variety of effects allow a creature to fly. While flying, you fall if you have the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] or [[conditions#prone|Prone]] condition or your [[fly-speed-xphb|Fly Speed]] is reduced to 0. You can stay aloft in those circumstances if you can hover.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
