# Blight Monkey
## Overview
### Blight Monkey
![[n4coayi5.yxz.png|Blight Monkey|300]]
[[n4coayi5.yxz.png|open outside]]

*This dark-furred monkey has slightly lighter fur around its face and chest, but all of it is matted with reeking filth. It hangs by its prehensile tail as it prepares to throw a handful of the filth that it wears so copiously.*

**Alignment**: Chaotic Evil

**Armor Class**: 14

Two different species of primate call the streets and rooftops of the city of Castrohage home. Whether they were once truly wild animals or not is unknown, but what is known is that, whether through the corruption or the sophistication of the city, each has developed very differently into something else.

## Other Details
**Ability Scores**: Str 6 (-2), 18 Dex (+4), Con 10 (+0), Int 3 (-4), Wis 10 (+0), 6 Cha (-2)

## Special Traits
**Blight Monkey Mange:** A creature infected with this disease must make a successful DC 10 Con saving throw every time it completes a long rest. On a failure, the creature’s Dexterity score is reduced by `dice: 1d2` and its Constitution score is reduced by 1. The disease ends when the creature’s Con saving throw succeeds two days in a row or when it receives a lesser restoration or comparable magic. Once the disease ends, the creature’s ability scores recover at a similar rate.

## Actions
**Melee Attack—Bite:** +6 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d3 + 4` piercing damage, and the creature must make a successful DC 10 Con saving throw or contract [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] monkey mange (see below).

**Ranged Attack—Excrement:** +6 to hit (range 10 ft./30 ft.; one creature). Hit: the creature must make a successful DC 10 Con saving throw or contract [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] monkey mange (see below).

**Area Attack—Enraged Screech:** The [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] monkey emits a harsh screech. Creatures within 30 feet that hear the screech must make a successful DC 10 Wis saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn. Once a creature makes a successful saving throw, it’s immune to the screeching of [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] monkeys for 24 hours.

## Description
**Environment**: Urban (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary, pair, band (3–9), or troop (10–40)

Like [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] apes, these little beasts are believed to have originated in distant Libynos and were originally brought to Casterhage as part of menageries, but unlike the apes no one wanted to continue importing the creatures after their nasty disposition was discovered. Somehow, it seems, they just kept creeping unseen onto ships in Libynosi ports and disembarking upon reaching the city. There was a time when seeing dozens of the things scampering across yardarms and hawser lines to reach the docks from ships newly arrived from the East was a common sight. When the true extent of their colonization of Castorhage was realized and their disease-ridden nature fully grasped, the city took steps to curtail this mass immigration. However, despite its best efforts the city’s efforts were far too late, and now thousands, if not tens of thousands, of the creatures clamber unseen — though certainly not unheard — across the city’s maze of rooftops.

Something about the city’s influence appears to have corrupted the creatures and changed them from previously mischievous and unruly animals to actual beasts with just enough intelligence to have a taste for cruelty and a strong penchant for chaos. Despite their nimbleness and glimmerings of intelligence, all attempts by folk to domesticate them and spellcasters to take them as familiars have failed as they invariably turn against their would-be masters at the first chance. They routinely destroy books and valuables, and attack family pets. Their habit of biting off the fingers and toes of humanoid infants sleeping in their cribs has earned them the eternal ire of [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] apes everywhere who always attack them on sight. [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] monkeys share this animosity, going out of their way to ambush or abuse [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] apes at every opportunity even flinging themselves into suicidal attacks in their attempts to bring harm to the apes. They are truly fearless in their stupefying anarchy and attack a creature much larger than themselves, using their grating screech to summon more of their kind to join in the attack. It is fortunate for the city that [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] monkeys appear to be a favored prey of gable spiders and [[Rat, Festering Lyme|festering Lyme rats]], because otherwise the fecund beasts would likely plague the city to an even greater degree.

All [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] monkeys are a carrier of a disease that is transmitted through their bite and through contact with their excrement. This disease causes the disgusting monkeys to lose patches of fur in clumps, but otherwise appears to cause them no harm. To others infected with [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] monkey mange, it causes a red, scaly rash in the crooks of elbows and knees and in the armpits. The rash is itchy and raw, causing pain and limiting movement until it clears up. [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] apes are known to be particularly susceptible to the ravages of this disease (see [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]] ape).
