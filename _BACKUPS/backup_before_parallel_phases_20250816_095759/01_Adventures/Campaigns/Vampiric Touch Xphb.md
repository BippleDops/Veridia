--- # Vampiric Touch

*3rd-level, Necromancy* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within reach. On a hit, the target takes``dice: 3d6``Necrotic damage, and you regain [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules) equal to half the amount of Necrotic damage dealt. Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as a [actions#Magic|Magic]] action, targeting the same creature or a different one. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by`d6`for each spell slot level above 3. **Classes**: [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 337.
