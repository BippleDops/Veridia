# Tenfold Ironguard (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a handful of iron fil-ings and a drop of aqua regia)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


## Effects
You and up to seven other willing targets become completely intangible to metal items. A target is immune to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical metallic weapons. It can pass through metal bars, gates and the like as if they were difficult terrain (a creature takes 1d10 force damage if it ends its turn inside a metal structure).

Each target may specify one metal object that they are holding while you cast this spell. The target will be able to continue holding that item for the duration. If that item is a container of some sort, it can continue hold other metal items inside of it.
