# Tentacle of Withering (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *6th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a small bone and a piece of rubber)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
One of your arms transforms into a wriggling gray tentacle with sticky suction cups.

You can use this tentacle to pick up objects with ease. The tentacle is 30 feet long.

If you strike someone with this tentacle, it does 1d6 + your Strength ability modifier in bludgeoning damage, plus 2d8 necrotic damage. In addition, the DM rolls on the following table to determine hit location and the effect that has:

**d8 Body Part Effect**

1-6 That limb is paralyzed until the end of your next turn. If it’s an arm, you cannot hold a weapon or shield in that hand. If it’s a leg, you must make a DC 15 Dexterity check or fall prone.

7-8 The creature is blinded or deafened until the end of your next turn.

On a successful hit, you may choose to grapple that creature (escape DC is equal to your spell save DC). As long as the grapple remains in effect, that target is restrained. At the start of each of your turns, you inflict an additional 2d8 necrotic damage.
