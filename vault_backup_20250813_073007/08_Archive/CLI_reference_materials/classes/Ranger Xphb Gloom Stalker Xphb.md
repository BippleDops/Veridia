## Class Features

### Gloom Stalker (Level 3)

*Draw on Shadow Magic to Fight Your Foes*

Gloom Stalkers are at home in the darkest places, wielding magic drawn from the Shadowfell to combat enemies that lurk in darkness.

### Dread Ambusher (Level 3)

You have mastered the art of creating fearsome ambushes, granting you the following benefits.

#### Ambusher's Leap

At the start of your first turn of each combat, your [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/speed-xphb|Speed]] increases by 10 feet until the end of that turn.

#### Dreadful Strike

When you attack a creature and hit it with a weapon, you can deal an extra `2d6` Psychic damage. You can use this benefit only once per turn, you can use it a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]].

#### Initiative Bonus

When you roll [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/initiative-xphb|Initiative]], you can add your Wisdom modifier to the roll.

### Gloom Stalker Spells (Level 3)

When you reach a Ranger level specified in the Gloom Stalker Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

**Gloom Stalker Spells**

| Ranger Level | Spells |
|--------------|--------|
| 3rd | [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/disguise-self-xphb|Disguise Self]] |
| 5th | [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/rope-trick-xphb|Rope Trick]] |
| 9th | [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/fear-xphb|Fear]] |
| 13th | [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-invisibility-xphb|Greater Invisibility]] |
| 17th | [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/seeming-xphb|Seeming]] |
^gloom-stalker-spells

### Umbral Sight (Level 3)

You gain [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/senses#Darkvision|Darkvision]] with a range of 60 feet. If you already have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/senses#Darkvision|Darkvision]] when you gain this feature, its range increases by 60 feet.

You are also adept at evading creatures that rely on [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/senses#Darkvision|Darkvision]]. While entirely in [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/darkness-xphb|Darkness]], you have the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Invisible|Invisible]] condition to any creature that relies on [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/senses#Darkvision|Darkvision]] to see you in that [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/darkness-xphb|Darkness]].

### Iron Mind (Level 7)

You have honed your ability to resist mind-altering powers. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice).

### Stalker's Flurry (Level 11)

The Psychic damage of your Dreadful Strike becomes `2d8`. In addition, when you use the Dreadful Strike effect of your Dread Ambusher feature, you can cause one of the following additional effects.

#### Sudden Strike

You can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and that is within the weapon's range.

#### Mass Fear

The target and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature has the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Frightened|Frightened]] condition until the start of your next turn.

### Shadowy Dodge (Level 15)

When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can take a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb|Reaction]] to impose [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on that roll. Whether the attack hits or misses, you can then teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.
