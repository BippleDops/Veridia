# Poisoned Tempest
## Overview
*Complex trap (level 11â€“16, deadly threat)*
This fiendish trap was built to eliminate intruders who infiltrate a yuan-ti temple. The trap is a room, 60 feet on a side, with 5-foot-wide stone doors in the middle of each wall. In each corner of the room stands a 10-foot-tall statue of a great serpent, coiled and ready to strike. The eyes in each statue are rubies worth 200 gp apiece.

### Trigger.
This trap activates when a ruby is pried from one of the statues. Each statue's mouth slides open, revealing a 1-foot-wide pipe that runs down its throat.

### Initiative.
The trap acts on initiative count 20 and initiative count 10.

### Active Elements.
The trap fills the room with poison and other deadly effects.

### Locked Doors (Initiative 20).
The four doors to this room slam shut and are locked in place by magic. This effect activates only once, the first time the trap is triggered.

### Poison Gas (Initiative 20).
Poison gas floods the room. Each creature inside must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, taking 33 (6d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Tempest (Initiative 10).
Air and gas boils from the trap. Roll a d6, and consult the following table.
