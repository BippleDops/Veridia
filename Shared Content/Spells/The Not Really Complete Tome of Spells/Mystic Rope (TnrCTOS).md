# Mystic Rope (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 300 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a rope made of braided hairs from a nightmare or a pegasus)

**Duration**: 10 minutes


## Effects
You create a magical, 100-foot long rope. You can mentally move the rope (it moves with a speed of 20 feet). The rope has two functions, climbing and entangling, and each round you may choose which function you wish to use.

♦ ***Climbing.*** The rope can climb up walls or cliffs, and secure and knot itself. It can also form a loop and hoist or lower weights up to 500 pound. You can command the rope to unknot and return to you.

♦ ***Entangling.*** You can throw the rope (range of 30 feet), or command it to move on its own. The rope will attack, using your spell attack modifier. On a hit, it grapples the target (escape DC equal to your spell save DC), and the target is restrained until the spell ends or you retract the rope.
