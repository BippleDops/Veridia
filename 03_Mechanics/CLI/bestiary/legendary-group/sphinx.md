# Sphinx

## Lair actions
_Source: Monster Manual_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the sphinx can take a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects; the sphinx can't use an effect again until it finishes a short or long rest:

- The flow of time is altered such that every creature in the lair must reroll initiative. The sphinx can choose not to reroll.  
- The effects of time are altered such that every creature in the lair must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become `d20` years older or younger (the sphinx's choice), but never any younger than 1 year old. A [greater restoration](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/greater-restoration-xphb.md) spell can restore a creature's age to normal.  
- The flow of time within the lair is altered such that everything within moves up to 10 years forward or backward (sphinx's choice). Only the sphinx is immediately aware of the time change. A [wish](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/wish-xphb.md) spell can return the caster and up to seven other creatures designated by the caster to their normal time.  
- The sphinx shifts itself and up to seven other creatures it can see within in its lair to another plane of existence. Once outside its lair, the sphinx can't use lair actions, but it can return to its lair as a bonus action on its turn, taking up to seven creatures with it.

## Player-Facing Summary

Sphinx is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of sphinx as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around sphinx.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties sphinx to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at sphinx to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to sphinx active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
