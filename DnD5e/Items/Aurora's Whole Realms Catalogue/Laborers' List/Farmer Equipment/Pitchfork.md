## Description
Seafarers call it the “land trident,” and for good reason: a pitchfork is as mighty in battle as in planting and tilling. We offer the traditional three-pronged maple pitchfork (2 gp) as well as an inventive variation from the lands of Thay that has a four-pronged head of steel (9 gp). (I suspect that this latter variety was never intended for farm use.)

## Additional Details
Pitchfork: Wt 4(8) lb; S L; Typ P; Spd Fctr 7; Dmg `dice: 1d4`/1d4(`dice: 1d4+1`/1d4+1)
