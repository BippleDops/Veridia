# Nature Call (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *cantrip*

**School**: *Conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 hour


## Effects
You summon fey spirits that take the form of beasts and appear in unoccupied spaces you can see within range. Choose one of the following options:

♦ One beast of challenge rating 1/8.

♦ Two beasts of challenge rating 0.

Each beasts is also considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions, but otherwise act normally. You may give them directions, but they are not under your total control.

***At Higher Levels.*** You summon twice as many creatures when you reach 5th level, three times as many when you reach 11th level, and four times as many when you reach 17th level.
