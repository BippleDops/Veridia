# Ballant's Stonesplit (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a diamond-tipped chisel worth 500 gp, which is consumed in the casting)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You channel the power of extreme magical force and strike a Large or smaller rock or object (or portion of an object) made primarily of stone, such as a stone wall. When you touch the stone, brilliant magical light flares out and a huge glowing crack grows in the rock. At the end of your next turn, the rock crumbles into rubble.

At any point between your casting the spell and the end of your next turn, this spell can be countered by *dispel magic* or a similar effect, preventing the rock from crumbling.

If cast on a creature made from stone, such as a stone-based earth elemental (a gar-goyle) or a stone golem, the creature may make a Constitution saving throw. The crea-ture suffers 10d10 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** This spell can affect a Huge object and do 11d10 damage if cast with an 8th-level spell slot, and can affect a Gargantuan object and do 14d10 damage if cast with a 9th-level spell slot.
