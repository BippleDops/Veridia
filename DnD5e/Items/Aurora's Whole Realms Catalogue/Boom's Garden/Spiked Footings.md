## Description
Surely it was a man who developed these ankle-twisting, nightmare shoes. I can little believe that one could walk in these footings across a perfectly smooth floor, let alone in some slanted dragonâ€™s lair. Even so, I have received enough ardent requests that I am compelled to stock these. By lifting the heel at an impossible angle from the ground, a stiletto blade has been imbedded vertically in the sole of these shoes. Another blade protrudes from the impossibly narrow toe. We offer shoes in red, brown, or black, with steel or bone blades. (10 gp)
