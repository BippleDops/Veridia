# Cover
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 364. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

Cover provides a degree of protection to a target behind it. There are three degrees of cover, each of which provides a different benefit to a target: Half Cover (+2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws), Three-Quarters Cover (+5 bonus to AC and Dexterity [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/saving-throw-xphb|saving throws]]), and Total Cover (can't be targeted directly). If behind more than one degree of cover, a target benefits only from the most protective degree.

## Player-Facing Summary

Cover xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of cover xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around cover xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties cover xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at cover xphb to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to cover xphb active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
