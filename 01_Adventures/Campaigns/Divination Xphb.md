--- # Divination

*4th-level, Divination (ritual)* - **Casting time:** 1 Action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (incense worth 25+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous This spell puts you in contact with a god or a god's servants. You ask one question about a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. The DM offers a truthful reply, which might be a short phrase or cryptic rhyme. The spell doesn't account for circumstances that might change the answer, such as the casting of other spells. If you cast the spell more than once before finishing a [[long-rest-xphb|Long Rest]], there is a cumulative chance for each casting after the first that you get no answer. **Classes**: [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 264.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of divination xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around divination xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## References - [[Master_Spell_Compendium]]
