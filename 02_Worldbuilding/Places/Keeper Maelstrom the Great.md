Legends speak of Keeper Maelstrom the Great as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Keeper Maelstrom the Great.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Keeper Maelstrom the Great to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
