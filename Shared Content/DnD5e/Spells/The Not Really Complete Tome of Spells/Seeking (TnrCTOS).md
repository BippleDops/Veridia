# Seeking (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 10 minutes


## Effects
You touch an arrow, slingstone, handaxe, or other object that is fired or thrown at a target. This object then will invariably hit the first creature it is aimed at, even traveling around corners to get to its target and past its normal range. It cannot pass through solid obstructions.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell with a 3rd-level or higher spell slot, you may enchant one additional missile for every spell slot above 2nd.
