## Description
When youâ€™ve come to the end of a long hike, and are ready for a hot meal, this miniature firegrate is perfect. It is a simple iron rack, about 6 inches by 12 inches, with a set of hinged legs on both ends. Simply swing the legs away from the rack, and it looks like a table, ready to hold your cookpot while it stands over the fire. Includes an iron prod for moving hot pots. 3 gp.
