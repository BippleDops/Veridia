# Blessed Warrior
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 110*  

**Prerequisite**: When Gaining the Level 2 Paladin "Fighting Style" Feature

You learn two Cleric cantrips of your choice. [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/guidance-xphb|Guidance]] and [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/sacred-flame-xphb|Sacred Flame]] are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Cleric cantrip.
