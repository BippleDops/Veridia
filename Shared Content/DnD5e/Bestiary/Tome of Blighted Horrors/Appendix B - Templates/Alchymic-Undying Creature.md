More commonly referred to as the “reborn,” alchymic-undying creatures are living creatures infused with the gifts of undeath through exposure to the mysterious elixir of life.

Any living creature can be transformed into an alchymic-undying creature when exposed to elixir of life (see The [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Spells/PHB Spells/A-E/Blight]]: Richard Pett’s Crooked City by Frog God Games). An alchymic-undying creature uses the base creature’s stat block, with the following differences:

- Challenge increases by 1.

- Constitution declines by 2; adjust hit points accordingly.

- Always has proficiency on Str and Dex saving throws, and on saves against disease (including ongoing effects of diseaases), paralysis, and poison.

- Is immune to exhaustion and unconsciousness

- Never ages or sleeps, and needs only 1/10 as much food, drink, and air as a normal creature of its kind.

- Negative Energy Affinity: An alchymic-undying creature never has its maximum hit points reduced by attacks from undead creatures.

- **Regeneration:** An alchymic-undying creature heals 1 hit point per 2 HD at the start of its turn, unless it took acid or fire damage since its last turn.
