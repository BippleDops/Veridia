# Scapegoat (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *enchantment*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (goat hair and a small stone)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


## Effects
You touch the target, who must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, all other creatures within 20 feet of the target that have an Intelligence of at least 5 believe that the target is responsible for whatever troubles are plaguing them. They are allowed to make an Intelligence saving throw to come to their senses. This saving throw is at disadvantage if they already have reason to dislike or distrust the target.
