## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting (1/Day).*** The mephit can innately cast blur, requiring no material components. Its innate spellcasting ability is Charisma.

***Death Burst.*** When the mephit dies, it explodes in a cloud of steam. Each creature within 5 ft. of the mephit must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 4 (`dice: 1d8`) fire damage.

## Actions
***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 2 (`dice: 1d4`) slashing damage plus 2 (`dice: 1d4`) fire damage.

***Steam Breath (Recharge 6).*** The mephit exhales a 15-foot cone of scalding steam. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4 (`dice: 1d8`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Variant: Summon Mephits (1/Day).*** The mephit has a 25% summoning chance chance of summoning `dice: 1d4` mephits of its kind. A summoned mephit appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other mephits. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

## Description
Composed of fire and water, steam mephits leave trails of hot water wherever they go, and they hiss with tendrils of steam. Bossy and hypersensitive, they are the self-appointed overlords of all mephits.
