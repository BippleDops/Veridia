## Overview

When the [[Crown of Stars shattered during [The Great Crystallization]], it broke into seven primary fragments, each containing a portion of [[The Crimson Sage ([Aetheron]])'s divine essence. These Shards are the most powerful artifacts in [[Aethermoor, capable of granting godlike power or bringing about the world's destruction. Their growing activity may be connected to [The Convergence Point]] between [[Aethermoor and [Aquabyssos]].

### The Convergence

> [!warning] DM Only

> 4. Choice determines world's fate

### Destroying a Shard

*"Seven lights that fell from grace,*
*Seven powers [[Time won't erase,*
*When united in one hand,*
*Gods shall walk upon the land."*

### The Warning

*"Beware [The Crown]] reformed in haste,*
*For power gained is humanity waste,*
*The price of godhood, mortals learn,*
*Is everything for which they yearn."*

## The Prophecy of Reunification

> **For the Table - Using the Prophecy:**
> - **Partial Reveals:** Give players one line per major milestone
> - **Multiple Interpretations:** Each faction reads it differently - let players discover why
> - **False Prophecies:** Include 2-3 red herrings that seem equally valid
> - **Player Agency:** The prophecy describes what COULD happen, not what MUST happen

### The Ultimate Choice

If party gathers all seven:
1. **Destroy**: Save world, lose magic
2. **Reform**: New god rises
3. **Scatter**: Restart cycle
4. **Transform**: Change reality's nature

## DM Secrets

> [!warning] Ultimate Truth
> The Shards aren't just fragments—they're Aetheron's attempt to experience mortality through division. Each represents an aspect of divinity experiencing mortal existence. The Golden Shard in Aria is his heart, experiencing innocence and growth. Reunification means choosing between godhood's power and mortality's meaning.
