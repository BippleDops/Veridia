# Pact of the Chain
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 157. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span>*  

You learn the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/find-familiar-xphb|Find Familiar]] spell and can cast it as a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Magic|Magic]] action without expending a spell slot.

When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/imp-xmm|Imp]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/dragon/pseudodragon-xmm|Pseudodragon]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/quasit-xmm|Quasit]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/undead/skeleton-xmm|Skeleton]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/slaad-tadpole-xmm|Slaad Tadpole]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/celestial/sphinx-of-wonder-xmm|Sphinx of Wonder]], [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fey/sprite-xmm|Sprite]], or [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/beast/venomous-snake-xmm|Venomous Snake]] (see appendix B for the familiar's stat block).

Additionally, when you take the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Attack|Attack]] action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb|Reaction]].
