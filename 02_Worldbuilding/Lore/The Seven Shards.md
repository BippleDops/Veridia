# The Seven Shards

*Fragments of Godhood Scattered Across the World*

> **For the Table:** The Seven Shards are your campaign's nuclear option - use them to escalate stakes, corrupt heroes, or offer terrible choices. Each shard should feel like handling unstable dynamite that whispers promises.

## Overview

When the Crown of Stars shattered during [[12_Research/D&D_References/The Great Crystallization]], it broke into seven primary fragments, each containing a portion of [[12_Research/D&D_Statblocks/The Crimson Sage]] (Aetheron)'s divine essence. These Shards are the most powerful artifacts in [[12_Research/D&D_References/Aethermoor]], capable of granting godlike power or bringing about the world's destruction. Their growing activity may be connected to [[12_Research/D&D_References/The Convergence Point]] between [[12_Research/D&D_References/Aethermoor]] and [[12_Research/D&D_References/Aquabyssos]].

## The Nature of Shards

- Seek reunification with each other
- Alter reality in their vicinity

- Size of a human fist
- Glow with inner light
- Resonate when near each other

The Golden Shard in Aria is his heart, experiencing innocence and growth. Reunification means choosing between godhood's power and mortality's meaning.

## Player-Facing Summary

The Seven Shards is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of The Seven Shards as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Seven Shards.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties The Seven Shards to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at The Seven Shards to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to The Seven Shards active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
