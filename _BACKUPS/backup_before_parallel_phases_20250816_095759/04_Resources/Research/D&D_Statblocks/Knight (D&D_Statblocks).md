He can use this feature 5 times per long rest. **Lay on Hands (70 points).** Theron can heal wounds or cure diseases as an action, expending points from his pool. **Aura of Protection.** Friendly creatures within 10 feet add +4 to saving throws. **Crystal Communion.** Theron can attune to Aethermoor crystals, gaining insight into their properties and recent events around them. This connection also allows him to purify corrupted crystals. **Champion's Challenge.** When Theron sees an ally attacked within 30 feet, he can use his reaction to force the attacker to make a **DC 17** Wisdom save or be compelled to target him instead. **Spellcasting.** Theron is a 14th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save **DC 17**, +9 to hit). He has the following paladin spells prepared:

- 1st level (4 slots): *bless*, *detect evil and good*, *protection from evil and good*
- 2nd level (3 slots): *aid*, *find steed*, *zone of truth*
- 3rd level (3 slots): *dispel magic*, *remove curse*, *spirit guardians*
- 4th level (1 slot): *freedom of movement*, *locate creature* ## Actions **Multiattack.** Theron makes two attacks with Dawnbreaker or casts a spell and makes one weapon attack. **Dawnbreaker (Crystal Longsword +2).** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (`dice: 1d8` + 6) slashing damage plus 9 (`dice: 2d8`) radiant damage. Against undead or shadow-touched creatures, deals an additional 9 (`dice: 2d8`) radiant damage. **Shield Bash.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`dice: 1d6` + 4) bludgeoning damage. Target must succeed on a **DC 17** Strength save or be knocked prone. **Crystal Beacon (1/Day).** Theron raises his sword, creating a 30-foot radius of bright light centered on himself for 10 minutes. Undead and fiends in this area have disadvantage on attack rolls, and allied creatures gain advantage on saves against fear and charm effects. **Purifying Strike (3/Day).** When Theron hits with a melee attack, he can expend a spell slot to deal additional radiant damage: `dice: 1d8` per spell slot level, and the target must succeed on a Constitution save or have any curse, disease, or shadow corruption suppressed for 24 hours. ## Description Sir Theron Crystalward stands as a beacon of hope in troubled times, his crystal-enhanced plate armor gleaming with inner light even in the deepest shadows. At 6'2" with steel-gray hair and piercing blue eyes that seem to reflect the very essence of Aethermoor's crystals, he embodies the ideals of knighthood while wrestling with the complexities of a changing world. Born into minor nobility, Theron earned his knighthood through valor during the Crystal Wars, where he discovered his unique ability to commune with and purify corrupted crystals. This gift has made him invaluable in the fight against shadow corruption, but it has also burdened him with knowledge of how deeply the taint has spread through both realms. His armor bears the crystalline sigil of his order, and intricate engravings tell the story of his greatest victories. Most notably, the crystal embedded in his breastplate pulses with a gentle light—a fragment of the original Heart of Aethermoor, gifted to him by [[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde herself. ## Relationships **Allies:**

- **[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]]** - His sovereign, whom he serves with absolute loyalty despite growing concerns about her recent decisions
- **[[Crystal Guard|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/Crystal Guard** - His knightly order, brothers-in-arms who share his burden of protecting the realm
- **[High Priestess Celeste Dawnbringer]]** - Spiritual advisor who helps him maintain his connection to divine power
- **[[Captain Lyanna Brightshield** - Fellow knight and former lover, their relationship ended when duty demanded different paths **Enemies:**
- **[Shadow Parliament]]** - The corruption they spread is antithetical to everything he stands for
- **[[The Biomancers** - Their twisted experiments disgust him, though he recognizes some may be necessary
- **Void Cultists** - Shadow worshippers who specifically target him for his crystal-purification abilities **Complicated:**
- **[Prince Caspian Duskwater]]** - The prince's recent behavior suggests possible shadow influence, putting Theron in an impossible position
- **[[Ambassador Korvin Blacktide** - He suspects the ambassador of treachery but lacks proof ## Quest Hooks 1. **The Tainted Crown** - Theron discovers that one of the crown jewels has been corrupted with shadow magic. He needs the party's help to investigate who had access and how to purify it without causing a political crisis. 2. **Knight's Dilemma** - Evidence suggests that [Prince Caspian Duskwater]] is working with shadow cultists. Theron must choose between his oath to the crown and his duty to protect the realm. He seeks trustworthy allies to help him uncover the truth. 3. **The Fallen Brother** - Sir Marcus Blackthorne, Theron's former squire, has joined the [[Shadow Parliament]]. Theron believes he can be saved and asks the party to help him rescue his old friend from corruption. 4. **Crystal Pilgrimage** - Ancient texts speak of a ritual that could permanently shield Aethermoor from shadow corruption, but it requires visiting seven sacred crystal sites. Theron needs companions for this dangerous journey. 5. **The Oath Breaker's Trial** - A fellow knight stands accused of breaking their oath and serving shadow masters. Theron must lead an investigation that could expose corruption at the highest levels of the Crystal Guard. ## Motivations **Primary**: Protect Aethermoor and its people from shadow corruption at any cost

**Secondary**: Preserve the ideals of knighthood in a world growing increasingly gray
**Hidden**: Find a way to permanently end the shadow threat while maintaining his own purity ## Roleplaying Notes **Personality**: Honor-bound and principled, but increasingly troubled by moral complexities. Speaks formally but warmly to those he trusts. **Ideals**: "True strength comes not from the sword, but from the will to do what's right even when it costs everything." **Bonds**: "My oath binds me to crown and crystal, but my heart belongs to the innocent who need protection." **Flaws**: "I hold myself to impossible standards and expect the same of others. Sometimes mercy is seen as weakness." **Voice**: Deep and resot, with a tendency to quote knightly codes and ancient wisdom. Uses formal address ("Sir," "My Lady") even with close friends. When angry, his voice becomes dangerously quiet rather than loud. **Mannerisms**: Often touches his crystal pendant when thinking, polishes his armor obsessively, and has a habit of standing at windows looking toward the Crystal Spires when troubled. ## Campaign Integration Sir Theron serves as an ideal quest giver for parties aligned with justice and order, though his rigid moral code can create interesting tension when players prefer morally ambiguous solutions. His crystal-purification abilities make him valuable in anti-corruption campaigns, while his political connections provide access to the highest levels of Aethermoor society. DMs can use his internal conflicts to explore themes of duty versus personal desire, and his growing awareness of political complexity can mirror player character development. ## DM Notes Theron works best as a recurring ally who grows and changes alongside the party. His formal speech patterns and tendency to quote classical wisdom can provide comic relief, while his genuine care for others creates emotional investment. Use his crystal pendant as a visual cue for his emotional state - it glows brighter when he's confident and dims when he's troubled. His nightmares about corrupted crystals can provide adventure hooks or foreshadowing for major threats. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Alliance - Manipulate succession ## Plot Hooks - A prisoner has gone missing and evil awakens
