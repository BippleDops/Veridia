# Continual Flame
*2nd-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50+ GP, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

A flame springs from an object that you touch. The effect casts [Bright Light](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) in a 20-foot radius and [Dim Light](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) for an additional 20 feet. It looks like a regular flame, but it creates no heat and consumes no fuel. The flame can be covered or hidden but not smothered or quenched.

**Classes**: [Druid](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Cleric](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Wizard (Evoker)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-evoker-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard (College of Lore)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
