## Description
This rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to [[Entangle|entangle]] a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15 [[Dexterity|Dexterity]] saving throw or become [[Restrained|restrained]].

You can release the creature by using a [[12 - The Order of Combat|bonus action]] to speak a second command word. A target [[Restrained|restrained]] by the rope can use an action to make a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15 [[Strength|Strength]] or [[Dexterity|Dexterity]] check (targetâ€™s choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.

The rope has [[2 - Armor|AC]] 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.
