# D20 Test
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 364. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

D20 Tests encompass the three main d20 rolls of the game: [[ability-check-xphb|ability checks]], [[attack-roll-xphb|attack rolls]], and [[saving-throw-xphb|saving throws]]. If something in the game affects D20 Tests, it affects all three of these rolls. The DM determines whether a D20 Test is warranted in a given circumstance.
