# Scroll of Titan Summoning (Animal Lord)
*Scroll, legendary*  

When you take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to read this scroll, an [[animal-lord-xmm|Animal Lord]] appears in an unoccupied space on the ground or in water that you can see within 1 mile of yourself.

The [[animal-lord-xmm|Animal Lord]] is [[hostile-attitude-xphb|Hostile]] toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]]. If the [[animal-lord-xmm|Animal Lord]] is summoned into a space that isn't large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted.
