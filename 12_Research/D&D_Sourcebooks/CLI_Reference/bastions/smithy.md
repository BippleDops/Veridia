## Craft Options

When you issue the "Craft" order to this facility, choose one of the following options:

- **Craft.** Smith's Tools. The facility's hirelings craft anything that can be made with [[smiths-tools-xphb (items)]], using the rules in the "Player's Handbook".  
- **Craft.** Magic Item (Armament). If you are level 9+, can you commission the facility's hirelings to craft a Common or an Uncommon magic item chosen by you from the "Armaments" tables in "chapter 7". The facility has the tool required to craft the item, and the hirelings have proficiency with that tool as well as proficiency in the [[skills#Arcana|Arcana]] skill. See the ""Crafting Magic Items"" section in "chapter 7" for the time and money that must be spent to craft the item. If the item allows its user to cast any spells from it, you must craft the item yourself (the facility's hirelings can assist), and you must have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item.

## Player-Facing Summary

Smithy is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of smithy as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around smithy.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
