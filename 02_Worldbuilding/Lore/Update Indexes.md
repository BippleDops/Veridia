## Lore Details

Legends speak of Update Indexes as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens‚Äîshifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind‚Äîthat herald change around Update Indexes.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties Update Indexes to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at Update Indexes to avert a public scandal.
