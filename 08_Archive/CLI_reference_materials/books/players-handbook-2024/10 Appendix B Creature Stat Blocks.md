# Appendix B: Creature Stat Blocks
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024), p. 346* 

This appendix provides stat blocks for creatures mentioned elsewhere in the book, particularly in the class, equipment, and spell chapters. See the "rules glossary" for how to read a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/stat-block-xphb|stat block]], and see the *Monster Manual* for even more creatures.

The following stat blocks are presented in alphabetical order. When the Dungeon Master uses a stat block, the DM may change details in it.
