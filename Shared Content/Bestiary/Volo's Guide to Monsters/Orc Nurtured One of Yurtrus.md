## Special Traits
***Aggressive.*** As a bonus action, the orc can move up to its speed toward a hostile creature that it can see.

***Corrupted Carrier.*** When the orc is reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes, and any creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (`dice: 4d6`) poison damage and becomes poisoned. On a success, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. A creature poisoned by this effect can repeat the save at the end of each of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. While poisoned by this effect, a creature can't regain hit points.

***Nurtured One of Yurtrus.*** The orc has advantage on saving throws against poison and disease.

## Actions
***Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 4 (`dice: 1d4+2`) slashing damage plus 2 (`dice: 1d4`) necrotic damage.

***Corrupted Vengeance.*** The orc reduces itself to 0 hit points, triggering its Corrupted Carrier trait.

## Description
When plague strikes a tribe, the hands of Yurtrus isolate the sick. The priest\~ then minister to those who can be saved but not healed. The hands cultivate the sickness of these nurtured ones, turning them into instruments of defense and weapons of war. When ores go to battle, a band of nurtured ones might charge in first-to give themselves up while softening up the enemy by spreading Yurtrus's vile blessing in its ranks.
