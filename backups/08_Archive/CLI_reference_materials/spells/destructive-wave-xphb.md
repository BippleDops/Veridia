# Destructive Wave
*5th-level, Evocation*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Sphere)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Destructive energy ripples outward from you in a 30-foot [Emanation](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md). Each creature you choose in the [Emanation](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes `5d6` Thunder damage and `5d6` Radiant or Necrotic damage (your choice) and has the [Prone](/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions.md#Prone) condition. On a successful save, a target takes half as much damage only.

**Classes**: [Cleric (Tempest Domain)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-tempest-domain.md "class=XPHB"); [Paladin](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-paladin.md)
