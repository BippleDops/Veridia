# The Seven Shards
*Fragments of Godhood Scattered Across the World*

> **For the Table:** The Seven Shards are your campaign's nuclear option - use them to escalate stakes, corrupt heroes, or offer terrible choices. Each shard should feel like handling unstable dynamite that whispers promises.

## Overview
When the Crown of Stars shattered during [[The Great Crystallization]], it broke into seven primary fragments, each containing a portion of [[The Crimson Sage]] (Aetheron)'s divine essence. These Shards are the most powerful artifacts in [[Aethermoor]], capable of granting godlike power or bringing about the world's destruction. Their growing activity may be connected to [[The Convergence Point]] between [[Aethermoor]] and [[Aquabyssos]].

## The Nature of Shards

### Divine Properties
- Contain fragments of Aetheron's consciousness
- Grant divine-level magical abilities
- Corrupt mortals who wield them
- Seek reunification with each other
- Alter reality in their vicinity

- Indestructible by mortal means
- Size of a human fist
- Glow with inner light
- Resonate when near each other
- Transform surroundings slowly

## Player-Facing Summary

The Seven Shards is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of The Seven Shards as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around The Seven Shards.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties The Seven Shards to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
