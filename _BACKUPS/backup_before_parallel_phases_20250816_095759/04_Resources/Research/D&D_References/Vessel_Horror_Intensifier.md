--- # Vessel Horror Intensifier Turn ships into characters and haunted spaces.

- Horror Scenes grant XP to ship and crew; but drain Sanity Pool (see [[Vehicle_Core_Rules)
- Exorcism/Communion: Anchor rites vs. Deep Mother bargains Tables are expanded under [Travel_Event_Table|Travel Event Table]]. ## Player-Facing Summary Vessel Horror Intensifier is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Vessel Horror Intensifier as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Vessel Horror Intensifier. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Shadow Alliance - Control trade routes ## Plot Hooks - Strange accidents suggest a curse
