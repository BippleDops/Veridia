These corporate giants offer opportunities for employment, partnership, investigation, or opposition, depending on player interests and moral alignments. ## Lore Details Merchants say that in the deepest vaults of the great trading companies, ledgers are kept not in ink but in liquid starlight, recording transactions that span dimensions and time itself. Some believe that the most successful corporate executives have made pacts with entities from beyond the mortal realm, trading portions of their humanity for unlimited wealth and influence. Ancient prophecies speak of a time when the corporate powers will either unite the realms in prosperity or destroy them in an endless war of greed and ambition. The signs are already visible to those who know where to look: mysterious disappearances of whistleblowers, impossible profits from failing ventures, and trade agreements signed in languages that predate known civilization. ## DM Notes Use the trading companies as a framework for complex political and economic intrigue, allowing players to engage with power structures that operate through influence rather than force. The competing interests and secret alliances between companies provide endless opportunities for plots involving espionage, betrayal, moral dilemmas, and the consequences of unchecked corporate power. Consider how corporate actions ripple through society, affecting everything from individual livelihoods to international relations. The companies serve as both potential allies and enemies, offering resources and opportunities while representing systematic corruption and inequality that can drive character motivations and campaign themes. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is blackmailing information for revenge
