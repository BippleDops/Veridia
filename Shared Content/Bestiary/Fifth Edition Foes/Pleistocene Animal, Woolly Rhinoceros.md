## Description
The woolly rhino is an herbivore of the Pleistocene era and of remote, lost worlds. It always lives near areas with plentiful water, such as along rivers, near lakes, and even in marshes and swamps. It does most of its foraging in the morning, so encounters are more common at this time. Although these beasts spend much time on their own, they gather in herds around watering holes when females have young that need protection.

The woolly rhino averages 11 feet long. The two horns on its snout grow to three feet in length. Its body is covered in a thick, dark fur that enables it to withstand harsh climates. The creature has poor eyesight, which only makes it more likely to overestimate the threat from an intruder and attack.
