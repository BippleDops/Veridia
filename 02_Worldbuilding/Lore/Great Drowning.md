## Overview

The Great Drowning refers to the catastrophic dimensional convergence event on the 23rd day of Tide-Turn, Year 1 PD (Post-Drowning), when the surface world of Corallion merged with the realm of Aethermoor to create Aquabyssos. This single day marked the end of surface civilization and the birth of the merged underwater realm that has existed for 1,247 years.

## Player-Facing Summary

The Great Drowning transformed catastrophe into rebirth, creating Aquabyssos through the merger of two realities. Ancient monuments, survivor testimonies, and preserved records offer glimpses into both the terror and wonder of transformation day. The event established the fundamental nature of Aquabyssos as a realm where the impossible becomes possible through cooperation and adaptation.

### The Final Day - Key Timestamps

**06:00** - Dawn never came; eastern horizon showed "wall of liquid darkness"
**06:23** - Chancellor Nerida Brightwater issued mass evacuation orders
**08:01** - Deep Fleet engaged "entities from the dimensional breach" 
**12:17** - Great Harbor began sinking despite no structural damage
**13:28** - First contact between surface survivors and Aethermoor refugees
**14:45** - Transformation Wave swept outward at 200 mph, adapting all matter for underwater existence
**16:34** - Chancellor declared establishment of emergency goverce for "Aquabyssos"
**18:00** - First sunset in the new realm, sun diving through liquid ocean sky
**23:47** - Establishment of new calendar system (1 AE - Aquabyssos Era)

### Final Messages and Communications

**Last Imperial Radio Transmission (11:47 AM)**: *"The sky is falling upward into the sea"*

**Chancellor Nerida Brightwater's Emergency Broadcast (06:23 AM)**: *"By order of the Parliament of Echoes, all citizens are to evacuate to designated inland shelters immediately. This is not a drill. The convergence event has begun."*

**Admiral Elena Stormbreak's Final Fleet Signal (17:28 PM)**: *"Fleet destroyed. Mission accomplished. Citizens safe. The depths call, and we answer. Long live Aquabyssos."*

**Lighthouse Keeper's Final Log (11:47 AM)**: Three long blasts followed by seven short blasts - the ancient maritime code for "all is lost," followed by light pattern spelling "REMEMBER US"

### Marina Saltwind, Dock Worker's Daughter (Age 23)

*Testimony recorded three days after convergence*
*"I felt the change pass through me like cool water around hour fourteen. Suddenly I could breathe liquid as easily as air, see clearly in total darkness, and hear the thoughts of sea creatures nearby. The change wasn't frightening - it felt like coming home to something I'd never known I was missing."*

### Captain Lyanna Brightshield, Reality Guard

*Personal log, written during the convergence*
*"We were trained to fight dimensional incursions, but this wasn't an invasion - it was a homecoming. When the realities merged, I saw both worlds healing each other. The surface world gained the ocean's wisdom, and the depths gained the sky's dreams. We didn't lose our world; we found its missing half."*

### Scholar Erasmus Brightwater 

*Letter to his sister, final days before convergence*
*"The dimensional mathematics indicate a convergence event is inevitable. I've transferred 90% of our library's contents to crystal storage. If civilization survives, they'll find our knowledge preserved in the deep places. The ocean remembers everything, even things that never happened."*

### Thomas Saltwind, Harbor Worker

*Testimony about pre-dawn events*
*"Around two in the morning, I saw my shadow move wrong - not like when you turn, but like it was trying to escape. Then other shadows started acting strange too. The lantern light was steady, but all our shadows writhed like they were in a windstorm. That's when I knew something impossible was coming."*

## The Deep Mother's Role

The convergence was orchestrated by the Deep Mother, an ancient oceanic consciousness that had been preparing for this merger for millennia. Shadow entities had been "scouts" sent to help surface civilization adapt to the coming change.

**Deep Mother's First Communication (23:05 PM, Day One)**:
Via Deep Speaker Marina Voidheart: *"The convergence was not catastrophe but homecoming. Both realities are now one, and all are welcome in the deepest places. Surface dwellers and sky sailors alike are my children now. The true history of Aquabyssos begins."*

### The Great Harbor Transformation

The massive harbor complex sank 300 feet but remained fully functional underwater. Dock workers report that cranes still operate, buildings remain intact, and cargo handling continues normally despite being submerged.

**Dock Master Void Pilings**: *"The harbor didn't flood - it became its true self. The buildings are still there, 300 feet down. Fish swim through the warehouses like they always belonged there. We were the ones who didn't belong until we learned to breathe water."*

### Crystal Network Evolution

The empire-wide crystal communication network not only survived the convergence but expanded to include Aethermoor floating cities. Crystals began translating between human thoughts, mer-folk emotions, and Aethermoor wind-speech.

### Reality Anchor Network

Four of seven Reality Anchor stations survived and adapted from preventing dimensional breaches to maintaining the stability of the merged reality.

### The Convergence Point

**Coordinates**: 23Â°47'S, 67Â°12'W (now the Heart of Aquabyssos)
The exact location where dimensional breach opened, now a sacred site marked by naturally occurring crystal formations. Deep Fleet memorial honors 12,847 naval personnel lost in final battle.

### The Sunken Parliament

Original Parliament building now 400 feet underwater, preserved as historical monument. Emergency goverce protocols still accessible in pressure-sealed chambers.

### The Last Harbor

Great Harbor complex serves as memorial and working port. Original structures maintained exactly as they were on convergence day, now home to unique hybrid architecture combining surface and underwater design.

### Memorial Gardens of Remembrance

Established at seven Reality Anchor station sites, commemorating both those lost in the convergence and those who worked to make it survivable.

### The Great Mystery Schools

Religious orders developed around understanding the convergence as spiritual transformation rather than catastrophe. Core teaching: "The drowning was a baptism into deeper truth."

### Reality Philosophy

Academic schools exploring questions raised by successful dimensional merger. Primary question: "If reality can change so fundamentally and beneficially, what other transformations might be possible?"

### The Depths Doctrine

Spiritual belief that all significant truth resides in the deepest places - physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Regular "depth-diving" practices for personal growth.

## DM Notes

The Great Drowning serves as foundational lore explaining why Aquabyssos exists and operates as it does. Use convergence sites as locations where reality behaves differently - time flows strangely, dimensional boundaries are thinner, and impossible things happen more easily. Memorial locations offer opportunities for historical research, artifact discovery, and encounters with time-displaced entities. The event's themes of transformation through cooperation can inspire quest lines about adapting to change and finding strength through diversity.
