# Vote Vaults

*"Democracy is the illusion of choice - here lies the machinery that creates that illusion."*

## Overview

The Vote Vaults are among the most dangerous secrets in Aquabyssos - a sophisticated network of hidden chambers where the city's elections are truly decided, long before citizens cast their votes. This underground complex serves as the operational headquarters for political manipulation, vote buying, and electoral fraud on a massive scale.

Built beneath the [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Parliament of Echoes, the Vote Vaults represent the shadow government's most critical infrastructure. Here, political outcomes are predetermined through a combination of bribery, blackmail, memory manipulation, and when necessary, elimination of uncooperative candidates.

## DM Secrets

### The Ultimate Truth
The Vote Vaults are actually a test system created by an ancient civilization to determine if current inhabitants deserve self-governance. Failure results in external control by the original builders.

### The Real Controllers
The shadow government is itself controlled by entities from another dimension who feed on political chaos and corruption.

### The Escape Clause
A hidden protocol exists to restore legitimate democracy, but activating it requires sacrifice from all current shadow government members.

*The Vote Vaults represent the corruption of democracy itself - where the people's will is manufactured rather than respected, and freedom becomes another commodity to be bought and sold in the shadows.*
