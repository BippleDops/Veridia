## Description
Our heat mats (5 cp) are quilted in Sembia and can absorb lead-melting heat levels before bursting into flame. We also offer pads made of a fibrous white crystalline material (5 gp) recently discovered in the Osraun Mountains and capable of withstanding any heat. (I knew one mage who constructed a suit of the stuff before descending to the Abyss. He returned untouched by the fire, but died shortly afterward with a hacking cough.)

## Additional Details
10 of the first type are required for a complete laboratory
