# Hunter's Mark
*1st-level, Divination*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You magically mark one creature you can see within range as your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra `d6` Force damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack roll. You also have [[advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on any Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]] or [[skills#Survival|Survival]]) check you make to find it.

If the target drops to 0 [[hit-points-xphb|Hit Points]] before this spell ends, you can take a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] to move the mark to a new creature you can see within range.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Your [[conditions#Concentration|Concentration]] can last longer with a spell slot of level 3-4 (up to 8 hours) or 5+ (up to 24 hours).

**Classes**: [[list-spells-classes-ranger|Ranger]]; [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-oath-of-vengeance-xphb "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"|Paladin (Oath of Vengeance)]]
