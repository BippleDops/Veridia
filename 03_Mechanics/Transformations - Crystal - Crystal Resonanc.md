# Crystal Resonance Transformation Path

*Harmonizing with the crystalline frequencies of the deep*

## Overview

The Crystal Resonance transformation represents a gradual attunement to the living crystals that grow throughout Aquabyssos. Unlike the violent Crystal Plague, this path involves willing harmonization with crystalline structures, trading flesh for mineral perfection while maintaining consciousness and control.

Those who follow this path become living tuning forks for magical energy, their bodies gradually transforming into resonant crystal that amplifies and focuses arcane power. The transformation is both beautiful and terrible—creating beings of stunning geometric perfection who have sacrificed their humanity for transcendent power.
