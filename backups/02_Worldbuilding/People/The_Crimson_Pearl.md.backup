# The Crimson Pearl

## Description

No one knows Scarlett's real name anymore - she's been The Crimson Pearl for so long that even she might have forgotten. A hauntingly beautiful sea elf with skin like polished alabaster and eyes that glow crimson in darkness. She drapes herself in strings of blood-red pearls that pulse with an unnatural light. Her movements are too fluid, too graceful, as if she's not quite bound by the same physics as others.

## Background

### The Surface Tragedy
Two hundred years ago, Scarlett was a legitimate pearl trader who made regular runs to [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Market District]]. During one surface visit, she encountered a vampire lord who saw potential in her ability to move between worlds. He turned her into a spawn, but the transformation went wrong when she returned to water - creating something unique and terrible.

### Rise to Power
- Murdered the previous Syndicate leader in single combat
- United the smuggling guilds through fear and profit
- Established the first reliable surface-to-depth black market
- Created the "Pearl Network" - criminals who wear her red pearls

## Criminal Empire
