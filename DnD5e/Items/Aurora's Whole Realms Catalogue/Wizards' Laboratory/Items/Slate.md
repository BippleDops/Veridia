## Description
Though our papyrus is cheap by market value, it still may cost a mage dearly. To reserve papyrus for permanent records, a mage’s laboratory needs a set of slates and some chalk. We offer two sizes of slates—a 1-foot square lap slate (10 gp) and a 4-by-6 foot wall slate (30 gp), which can either be either mounted on a (sturdy) wall or set on one of our [[Easels|easels]]. Chalk comes at 1 cp per stick, or a bundle of 12 for 1 sp. We also offer chalk in red and yellow for 3 cp each (2 sp for 12).

## Additional Details
A complete laboratory requires 1 lap slate, 1 wall slate, and 2 chalk bundles
