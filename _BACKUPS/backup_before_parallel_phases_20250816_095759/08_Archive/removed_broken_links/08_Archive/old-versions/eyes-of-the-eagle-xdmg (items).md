--- # Eyes of the Eagle

*Wondrous item, uncommon* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/eyes-of-the-eagle.webp#right) These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have [[Advantage Xphb on Wisdom ([skills#Perception|Perception]]) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 261.
