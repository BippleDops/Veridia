# Protyugh
## Overview
### Protyugh
![[miyzpvbh.1hx.png|Protyugh|300]]
[[miyzpvbh.1hx.png|open outside]]

*The creature is a horrible mix of otyugh and … something. It has the basic tripod shape of an otyugh with its fanged maw on the side of its central body, but instead of a tentacle and an eyestalk, it has an arcing tail with thick spikes down its entire length. In addition, two arms ending in wicked claws emerge from the mouth of the beast to grope at whatever it can make its next meal.*

**Alignment**: Chaotic Neutral

**Initiative**: +1

**Armor Class**: 15 (natural armor)

**Hit Points**: 140 (`dice: 14d10 + 70`)

**Speed**: 30 ft.

**Challenge**: CR 7

**Experience**: 2,900 XP

## Other Details
**Ability Scores**: Str 17 (+3), Dex 12 (+1), Con 20 (+5), Int 6 (-2), Wis 13 (+1), Cha 6 (-2)

**Saving Throws**: Con +8, Cha +1

**Skills**: Perception +4

**Damage Resistances**: Lightning damage

**Damage Immunities**: Acid, disease; any effect that would alter the protyugh’s form

**Senses**: Blindsight 30 ft., darkvision 60 ft.

**Languages**: Otyugh; understands Common but can’t speak it

**Size**: Large

**Type**: Aberration

## Special Traits
**Magical Attacks:** A protyugh’s attacks count as magical.

**Regeneration:** If the protyugh has at least 1 hit point at the start of its turn, it heals 5 hit points.

**Swallow:** If a protyugh starts its turn with a creature grappled in its claws, it immediately makes a claws attack as a bonus action. If the attack hits, the creature takes `dice: 3d6` slashing damage and is swallowed. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained. It takes `dice: 1d6` bludgeoning damage plus `dice: 1d8` acid damage automatically at the start of each of the protyugh’s turns. One Large, two Medium, or four Small creatures can be inside the protyugh at one time, thanks to its unstable form. A swallowed creature is unaffected by anything happening outside the protyugh or by attacks from outside it. A swallowed creature can get out of the protyugh by using 5 feet of movement, but only after the protyugh is dead.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The protyugh attacks once with its tail and once with its claws.

**Melee Attack—Tail:** +6 to hit (reach 10 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d8 + 3` bludgeoning damage, and the creature must make a successful DC 16 Wis saving throw or be confused (per the confusion spell) until the end of its next turn. Chaotically-aligned creatures have tactical advantage on this saving throw.

**Melee Attack—Claws:** +6 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 2d10 + 3` slashing damage, and the creature must make a successful DC 14 Str saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 13).

## Description
**Environment**: Underground (the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Tome of Blighted Horrors/Appendix C - Hazards/Blight]])

**Organization**: Solitary

Aberrations are notoriously difficult for physicians to use in experiments, but their discovery of the unique chaos properties of proteans and the ever-endurable pliability for which otyughs are known within their ranks proved to be the key to finally crafting a mortal-aberration cross. The resulting protyugh, an otyugh with an infusion of naunet protean, has bred true and become an extremely interesting experiment, even if its utility is limited by the randomness that is inherent to its very nature. Even the feasibility of using otyugh as guard beasts in sewers and abattoirs is somewhat lost since the protyugh gained none of the naunet’s intellect but also lost the otyugh’s territorial instincts. A protyugh is just as likely to wander away as to establish a lair in any given location. Despite these setbacks, the physicians still consider its existence to be one of their greatest successes and continually seek ways to further enhance the species.

Like otyughs, protyughs are primarily offal eaters. However, unlike otyughs, their palate is even less refined, causing them to try to ingest anything from garbage and corpses to former allies and even furniture and large pieces of masonry. The result is that protyughs manage to keep few allies (most either flee or are eventually eaten), and they are continually regurgitating previous meals because of the inedible nature of so much that is placed in their maws. Certain scavengers have learned that if one is cautious enough, it is often beneficial to follow behind a protyugh and search through its regurgitated past meals because there are often items of value that it has ingested and then left carelessly behind after they proved to be indigestible.
