# Weird Tank
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/weird-tank.webp#right)


A weird tank is a ten-gallon tank of blown glass and sculpted bronze with a backpack-like carrying harness fashioned from tough leather. A [water weird](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird-xmm.md) is contained within the tank. While wearing the tank, you can use an action to open it, allowing the [water weird](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird-xmm.md) to emerge. The [water weird](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird-xmm.md) acts immediately after you in the initiative order, and it is bound to the tank.

You can command the [water weird](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird-xmm.md) telepathically (no action required) while you wear the tank. You can close the tank as an action only if you have first commanded the [water weird](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird-xmm.md) to retract into it or if the [water weird](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird-xmm.md) is dead.

If the [water weird](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird-xmm.md) is killed, the tank loses its magical containment property until it spends at least 24 hours inside an elemental water node. When the tank is recharged, a new [water weird](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird-xmm.md) forms inside it.

The tank has AC 15, 50 hit points, vulnerability to bludgeoning damage, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing the tank to 0 hit points destroys it and the [water weird](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/elemental/water-weird-xmm.md) contained within it.
