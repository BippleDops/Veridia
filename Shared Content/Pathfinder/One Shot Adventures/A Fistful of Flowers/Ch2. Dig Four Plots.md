## Chapter 2: Dig Four Plots

Whether the PCs learn the address from Darius himself or find it in his ledgers, the next step for them is the trip to the nearby town of Rosentry. The trip itself is uneventful, and the PCs should be able to safely rest and recover to full strength before arriving. The town of Rosentry is little more than a glorified vacation town—pandering to the many nobles who keep seasonal homes away from home in the area is the settlement’s primary industry. The numerous estates that make up the town’s forest-facing borders all have large rolling lawns separating one another but are still close enough that an easy trip on horseback or by carriage can allow neighbors to visit. The Meliosa estate is a relatively average example of Rosentry’s estates, and there’s very little to bother the leshys as they make their way toward the indicated address, a fact the GM should make abundantly clear. Every insect has been poisoned with a vengeance; every mole and vole that might ruin the perfect lawns has been massacred. Few of the plants in the area are native species, and the only sign of natural life comes from the few stray songbirds who visit the local birdbaths or the distant sight of a horse in tack porting a cart of supplies for one of the local residences.

As the PCs draw near to the Meliosa Estate, though, the sounds of her gala in the expansive garden in her manor’s back yard become impossible to ignore.

Lady Constance Meliosa (NE female human sorcerer 5) is a sorcerer with a primal bloodline. During her leshy research, she discovered a ritual to create the creatures. While she knew that leshys were sapient, Constance found the idea inconvenient and dismissed the notion.

In her opinion, “her” leshys (be they ones she created or those she had abducted and brought to her) have little more intelligence than insects or a very slow-witted dog but are oh-so-much-more appealing in appearance. While she technically serves as the villain of this adventure, she isn’t willing to involve herself in combat or risk herself at all. Instead, the main threats of this climactic encounter are four particularly surly leshys she created and which currently serve as garden guardians.

Lady Constance Meliosa’s garden and manor is surrounded by a 5-foot-tall cast iron fence, surrounded by a thick privet hedge. The PCs can hear the chattering of humans enjoying a tea party on the other side, but without a means to see over the hedge, they have no line of sight into the garden. The iron gate to the garden is locked, and knocking or calling out simply results in Constance peering over the fence, making a disgusted face, and telling the offending party to leave her property immediately.

A PC who succeeds at a DC 16 Athletics check or DC 19 Acrobatics check can Climb over or Squeeze through the hedge and fence (a PC with an ability that allows them to avoid difficult terrain from foliage gains a +2 circumstance bonus on their check); the PCs can try this check as many times as they like, but a critical failure alerts the garden guests to the PCs’ presence. They can also attempt to Pick the Lock on the garden gate with a DC 20 Thievery check, but unless they use stealth to Hide as well, they’ll be noticed and alert the partygoers.

The PCs might also attempt to cause a commotion or even a dangerous event, such as a fire, outside of the gates; so long as Lady Constance is unaware of the PCs’ presence, she quickly opens the gate to deal with the problem via magic, but if she knows the PCs are outside the fence, she does her best to handle the issue without opening the gate.

The glass tables are 4 feet tall, and the wood chairs are 2 feet tall. The tables have a Hardness of 1 and 4 Hit Points, and create difficult terrain in their squares if broken. The patches of wildflowers along the east and west sides of the garden are all 2 feet tall or higher, creating difficult terrain but also offering cover to Hide in. Most of these flowers look foreign to the PCs, as they’ve been imported from other countries with little regard to whether they’re invasive to the local environment.

**Creatures:** The garden is currently playing host to Lady Constance, five luxuriously dressed ladies, and two fabulously dressed gentlemen. The guests are enjoying a tea party with two tiny kidnapped leshys serving as centerpieces for the tables, each pair trapped within decorative glass bell jar displays and unable escape on their own.

So long as the PCs haven’t alerted the guests to their presence and are able to avoid being spotted by Lady Meliosa’s leshys, the guests are too engrossed in their conversation to notice the PCs enter the garden. With the kidnapped leshys displayed openly on the tea tables, however, it’s unlikely that the PCs can retrieve their friends and escape stealthily. If Constance notices the PCs, she extremely politely informs them that her garden is by invitation only and asks them to leave. Confronted about the kidnapped leshys, she calmly—if unconvincingly—tells the PCs that they’re mistaken and that the leshys decorating the table were creations of Constance’s own making and are merely “animated distractions.” Constance is clearly aggravated that a group of uninvited plants have interrupted her gathering, especially to accuse her of wrongdoing. Her responses are as disgustingly saccharine and condescending as possible with barely concealed malice dripping behind every polite word.

The party guests seem to be having a great time, but a PC who succeeds at a DC 16 Perception check to Sense Motive recognizes that they seem quietly strained; these nobles were unlucky enough to fall afoul of Constance’s disapproval earlier in the day and are trying desperately to get back into her good graces before suffering consequences. All of the guests lapse into stunned silence at any verbal altercation, hastily supporting Constance if prompted but otherwise not acting for or against the PCs or Lady Meliosa. A PC who succeeds at a DC 20 Diplomacy check can sway a specific guest to sympathize with the PCs and stolen leshys—sympathetic guests aren’t willing to take any risks to help the PCs but are willing to subtly help if they think Lady Constance isn’t looking, such as quietly slipping a kidnapped leshy off the table and to a nearby PC. Any critical failure on this check, however, results in Constance realizing what the PCs are trying to do, at which point she commands her own leshy guards to attack. Should violence break out, the guests immediately hide behind cover and don’t interfere in the fight, beyond “ooo”ing at any particularly nasty blow. The guests immediately try to flee if they take damage.

Meliosa’s four unique leshy guards hide throughout the garden, each standing among a thicket of similar plants: a mint leshy, a wisteria leshy, a honeysuckle leshy, and a golden bamboo leshy. They only reveal themselves if Lady Constance commands them to attack, if violence breaks out, or if they see the PCs when Lady Constance hasn’t.

The garden leshys hold no solidarity with the PCs or the kidnapped leshys, as all of them are as foreign to the area as the rest of the garden plants and view the overmanicured town of Rosentry as a lush refuge in the middle of an unseemly wilderness.

Lady Constance is willing to play along with the PCs until it’s clear they have no intention of leaving, at which point she claps her hands to command her leshys to attack. Constance isn’t willing to risk harm by taking any action in combat beyond ducking for cover. Should a fight break out, she hides behind furniture, shrieking and verbally cursing the PCs. Any damage to her person makes her flee for safety. She only considers using her spells against the PCs as a last resort if they block her escape and continually attack her with lethal damage.

Though defeating the enemy leshys is the most straightforward means of resolving the conflict, the PCs can just as easily attempt to grab the kidnapped leshys and run—once the PCs are 100 feet away from the garden fence, Meliosa’s leshys give up pursuit. If the PCs defeat all of the enemy leshys, the party guests come to realize that their host’s actions were deplorable and are quick to take the PCs’ side—the guests don’t stand in their way as they exit the garden with their rescued kin.
