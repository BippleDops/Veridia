# Vicious Mockery
You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take `dice: 1d4|avg` (1d4) psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

This spell's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (`dice: 2d4|avg` (2d4)), 11th level (`dice: 3d4|avg` (3d4)), and 17th level (`dice: 4d4|avg` (4d4)).
