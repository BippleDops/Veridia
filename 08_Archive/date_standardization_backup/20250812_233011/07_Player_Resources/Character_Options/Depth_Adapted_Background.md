# Depth Adapted Background
*"The pressure doesn't break me - it makes me stronger."*

## Overview
You were born or raised in the crushing depths of Aquabyssos, where pressure shapes both body and soul. Your life has been defined by the vertical hierarchy of depth-based society, whether you thrived within its structure or chafed against its restrictions. The weight of water above has forged you into someone who understands that true strength comes from adapting to forces beyond your control.

## Skill Proficiencies
Choose two from: Athletics, Insight, Medicine, Perception, or Survival

## Languages
Aquan and one other language of your choice

## Equipment
- Depth gauge (pressure meter)
- Set of common clothes adapted for underwater wear
- Pressure-resistant personal effects
- Belt pouch containing 15 gp worth of deep-sea currency (pressure-forged coins)

## Feature: Depth Dweller
You have lived your entire life under crushing water pressure and understand its effects intimately. You can accurately estimate depth and pressure conditions, predict pressure-related weather patterns, and navigate by pressure gradients. In Aquabyssos settlements, you can secure food and lodging for yourself and companions at depths appropriate to your caste level. You also have contacts within the depth-based social hierarchy who can provide information or minor assistance.

## Suggested Characteristics
Your experience in the depths has shaped your worldview. You may embrace the rigid structure of depth-based society or rebel against its inequalities. The constant pressure has either made you incredibly resilient or given you a deep appreciation for rare moments of relief.
