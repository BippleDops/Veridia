## Description
You'll not find a wealthy wheelwright north of Neverwinter: wheels either mire in the northern snow or slide helplessly across the ice. Cutters, on the other hand, are another matter entirely. In our sleigh, you can travel north of Icewind Dale until your horse freezes before you will get mired in snow. All of our sleighs have hardwood runners plated with steel, canted frames for stability, broad footboards, and a leather-padded seat. We offer both two-person (200 gp) and four-person (300 gp) models.
