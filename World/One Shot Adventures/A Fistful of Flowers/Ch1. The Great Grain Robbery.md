> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> Here and there in the wilds of the Verduran Forest, a seemingly normal plant suddenly reveals themself as a leshy, a curious little human-shaped plant crafted by a druid as a companion or minion. Sometimes, leshys outlive their druid creators, while many others are set free to live their own lives. Most of those who live in the Verduran Forest today have stories along these lines, yet recently the forest’s clusters of leshys have seemed thinner and fewer. You are but four of these stories.
> 
> It’s hardly unusual for the leshys of Verduran to come and go as they please, but this morning it has become impossible to ignore the fact that your numbers have dwindled significantly. Many of those who remain grow fearful, and as the larger and more powerful leshys in the area, it’s your duty to protect the smaller spirits. It’s time to admit something is wrong. It’s time to investigate.

In A Fistful of Flowers, your players take on the role of four leshys who seek out the cause of these problems. When you begin, each player should choose one of the four leshy characters presented on pages 12–15 of this adventure, or alternatively, create 3rd-level leshy characters of their own design. Full rules for leshy PCs appear on pages 52–55 of Pathfinder Lost Omens Character Guide.

As the players get to know each other’s characters, you can give them some time for a bit of light roleplaying before they begin their adventure, if you wish. The PCs are the closest thing the local leshys have to an authority—they and their missing companions are very delicate creatures, unable to even speak, and so can offer little assistance. Fortunately for the PCs, they have a lead! The latest vanished locals are a pair of lavender leshys who often played down by a nearby river crossing. So far, no one’s been to the river to look for clues—this task falls to the PCs!

## THE RIVER CROSSING

The river’s rapid flow makes it difficult for lightweight creatures like leshys to cross. Normally, swimming isn’t required, however. In her youth, Popcorn found herself at a loss at this very spot when the sprites she enjoyed playing with flew across the water with ease and taunted her from the far side. Though there was little she could do that day other than fume in rage, Popcorn returned the next morning and used vines and fallen branches to build a leshy-sized rope bridge strung between a pair of trees on opposite banks. In the years since, many local leshys have learned of the [[rope]] bridge and come to appreciate its convenience, and particularly enjoyed using the bridge as a sort of swing to sit on and sway back and forth over the river. When the PCs arrive, Popcorn’s carefully crafted handiwork lies in ruins. All that remains of the rope bridge are fragments of vines hanging from the trees on both banks.

While this fact isn’t yet clear to the PCs, the lavender leshys who went missing were indeed playing on the rope bridge here when an alchemist named Darius, an associate of Lady Constance Meliosa, came into the woods hunting for leshys. Darius found the two lavender leshys playing on the bridge, then crept up and cut the vines, dropping the leshys into the river. They clung to the vines for dear life, making it easy for Darius to simply pull the vine in and bag the two drenched creatures before wading across the river back to his home.

**Clues:** A PC who succeeds at a DC 16 Crafting or Nature check or a DC 18 Perception check while Searching the vines for clues determines conclusively that the vines didn’t snap on their own; they were cut deliberately with a sharp knife.

A PC who examines the nearby riverbank and succeeds at a DC 16 Perception check to Seek notices a scattering of tiny purple flowers amid the gravel on the bank. A successful DC 10 Nature check to Recall Knowledge correctly identifies them as lavender flowers, while a critical success confirms these petals came from the missing leshys.

The far bank is muddy, and a character who examines that side and succeeds at a DC 18 Perception check to Seek notices footprints of a Medium-sized, bipedal creature who wears shoes in the mud, appearing to emerge from the river and then lead up the opposite embankment. If no PC notices the tracks, they do so automatically just before leaving the area, but doing so causes them to become delayed (see the Becoming Delayed sidebar on page 5).

**Crossing the River:** To follow the tracks, the PCs must cross the river. Swimming across is possible but difficult due to the current—a PC who succeeds at a DC 20 Athletics check to Swim can make it across, but on a failure, they wash ashore back on their side of the river (on a critical failure, they take 1d6 bludgeoning damage from being swept against submerged rocks).

If Bottlespeaker uses his scroll of enlarge to become Large, he can wade back and forth across the river, carrying one fellow PC at a time, automatically.

The PCs can also Repair the rope bridge with a DC 18 Crafting check, as long as they can reach overhanging vines and branches on the opposite bank to start the repair work. Popcorn, using her grasping reach ability, or a leshy who has become Large from an enlarge spell can do this. At your discretion, creative ways to reach the hanging vines on the opposite bank can also suffice.

No repair kit is needed to Repair the bridge, as all of the materials needed are present. The PCs become delayed each time they attempt to repair the bridge but fail to do so.

Finally, the PCs can simply travel downstream for a while to cross the river at a shallow spot, but doing so causes them to become delayed.

**Tracking the Footprints:** After crossing the river, the PCs can Track the footprints with a DC 18 Survival check; this trail includes both footprints and the occasional lavender flower. The PCs become delayed if none succeed at this check, but they catch up (see the Becoming Delayed sidebar on page 5) if anyone critically succeeds at this Survival check.

## DARIUS’S CAMPSITE

![[npc - glimmer2.png|right]]

After following the trail of footprints from the riverbank for an hour, the PCs come to a small clearing in the forest, in which sits a recently used but currently unoccupied campsite. Darius uses this camp as a base of operations when he visits the forest to abduct leshys. [[Shared Content/Pathfinder 2e/Bestiary/Bestiary/Pixie|Pixie]]

**Clues:** A search of the campsite reveals half-burned candles that smell of jasmine and the mostly-eaten remnants of a meal of trail rations. If the PCs succeed at a DC 16 Perception check, they also discover a scattering of shiny shells, smooth stones, and mostly burnt feathers among the campfire’s now cold coals. As leshys, the PCs automatically recognize these as “lucky charms” often carried by the smaller leshys in the region. (Darius paused here to examine his catch; when he discovered the lucky charms among the possessions of the leshys he abducted, he tossed them into the fire to bully the poor creatures into silence before eating his lunch and then moving on.)

**Creature:** As the PCs reach the campsite, they’re observed by a local pixie named Glimmer. Roll Glimmer’s Stealth +11 as the PCs begin to search for Clues. If she remains undetected by rolling above all four of the PCs Perception DCs (DC 21 if the party consists of the four leshys presented in this adventure), she watches quietly as the PCs examine the camp. Once it looks like they’re about to leave, she giggles and tosses a satchel filled with teardrop-shaped blue seeds at Popcorn, hitting the leshy in the head. This does no damage but certainly attracts the PCs’ attention. Glimmer then calls out a cheerful greeting, “Poooppcoorn! The seeds in that bag are just your type! Cook ‘em up and munch ‘em and you’ll toughen up for a bit! Sorry about hitting you in the head, but it’s such a tempting target!” before she flutters down to talk.

```statblock
monster: Pixie
```

```encounter-table
name: Glimmer
creatures:
 - 1: Pixie
```


If the PCs notice her, Glimmer waves at the group, then tosses the seed bag down to Popcorn’s feet before fluttering down to speak to them.

Glimmer continues to playfully banter with the PCs, her speech growing faster and flittering between topics until one of them mentions the missing leshys. At this point, Glimmer’s eyes widen, and she exclaims, “So that’s what that fella was on about!” The pixie goes on to explain to the PCs that she was out gathering neat new seeds (indicating the bag she gave Popcorn) when she came upon this campsite while it was still occupied.

She describes the camp’s occupant as a human man with shiny teeth, messy red hair, a green and yellow outfit, and muddy boots. When she arrived, he’d just finished yelling at a squirming burlap sack to “Be quiet or I’ll throw more than your toys in the fire!” The sack went still after that, and the man enjoyed his lunch in peace. Glimmer watched for a bit but didn’t confront the man; she then grew bored when he took too long, so she settled in on her tree branch for a nap. She only woke when she heard the PCs arrive and isn’t sure when the man below left the campsite—“Couldn’t have been too long though, since my naps don’t last that long!”

Asked why she didn’t investigate further, she snorts: “I didn’t want to end up in that sack along with whatever else he had in there—oh! You don’t think it’s your leshy friends do you?”

Glimmer has little else to say other than to wish the PCs good luck in their search for the missing leshys and to remind Popcorn that the seeds in the bag taste “real good when you cook them up!” The pixie won’t accompany the PCs on their quest, but at your option, if the PCs get in over their head later on, Glimmer can pop in to rescue them. 

### GLIMMER CREATURE 4
Female pixie (Pathfinder Bestiary 309)
Initiative Perception +12

**Treasure:** The sack Glimmer tosses to Popcorn contains four large blue seeds that taste quite bitter if eaten raw. If they’re properly cooked up, they pop loudly into a fluffy pale blue treat, at which point each seed functions as a barkskin potion. The campfire itself is a perfect place to prepare these seeds for later eating—while no check is required to prepare them properly, a DC 18 Crafting check allows them to be prepared quickly and efficiently; a failure on this check causes the PCs to become delayed.

## FOREST’S EDGE TRIVIAL 3

After another hour of following Darius’s trail, the PCs come to the southern edge of the Verduran Forest. Here, the trees give way to fields of crops and wildflowers, and a small village—Petalbrook—can be seen just a bit further on. Darius’s trail leads in this direction, only to fade away once the tracks lead onto the road leading into the village.

**Hazard:** From among the thinning trees, a curious and brave pack of deer decides to investigate the strangely mobile bundles of delicious petals, leaves, gourds, and mushrooms that have stumbled across their path. It’s only a moment later before the deer approach the PCs and start to nibble on them.

==ENTERR DEER STATBLOCK==

**Reward:** For tracking Darius to Petalbrook, grant the PCs 80 XP.

#### BECOMING DELAYED

The alchemist Darius has a head start on the PCs, but if they act fast, they can eventually catch up to him in the village of Petalbrook. Along the way, failed checks to follow the clues can result in the group becoming delayed.

Delayed always has a value. Increase all of the DCs for skill checks found in “Clues” portions of encounters by an amount equal to the party’s delayed value. In addition, foes encountered in Chapter 1 gain a circumstance bonus to their initiative checks equal to this value, as they’ve had a bit more time to prepare.

Each time a failed skill check indicates the PCs become delayed, increase the value of their delayed condition by 1, to a maximum of delayed 4. Every time the PCs stop to rest for the night, they become delayed.

There are opportunities for the PCs to catch up as well, typically by achieving critical successes on key skill checks. Each time the PCs catch up, reduce their delayed condition value by 1.

## PETALBROOK





The village of Petalbrook is friendly enough to visitors, and safe enough for its citizens to ensure the classic feel of small town comfort. This close to the Verduran Forest, and with several productive fields nearby, the villagers have no trouble securing food. The wildflower fields also make Petalbrook an ideal place for beekeeping. The village produces a considerable surplus of honey, which it trades with other villages in exchange for crafted goods.

The citizens of Petalbrook are no strangers to leshys, and while they might react to the PCs’ arrival in town with curiosity or vague amusement, they won’t overreact to the arrival of a group of leshys in the same way they might at the arrival of a group of dangerous looking criminals or forest monsters. Older citizens treat visiting leshys with careful respect, correctly surmising that the PCs are spirits from the woods and believing that nothing good can come from angering the forest’s guardians. Village children react with a mixture of astounded curiosity and fear—very few of them have seen a leshy before, and they aren’t quite sure what to make of the PCs.

As the leshy PCs draw more and more attention, how they comport themselves will determine how long it’ll take for them to learn about the missing leshys from the villagers. Each PC must attempt a DC 18 check, using Deception (to trick the villagers into cooperating), Diplomacy (to diffuse the tension and befriend the villagers), Intimidation (to cow the villagers into compliance), Performance (to entertain the villagers and set them at ease), or Society (to know how to behave properly in a small town). Regardless of the results of these, the PCs can speak with the villagers to uncover more clues, but if more PCs fail their chosen checks than succeed, the group becomes delayed. If all of the PCs succeed at their checks, they catch up. And if at least one PC is critically successful, they’ll earn a gift (see Treasure, below).

Clues: If the PCs ask the villagers about the missing leshys, the locals shrug and point out that the PCs are the first leshys they’ve seen in town in over a year. If, on the other hand, the PCs ask about a man fitting the description given to them by Glimmer, the villagers immediately know who they’re talking about—“That sounds like ol’ Darius Wick for sure!” The villagers describe him as a bit of a strange fellow who isn’t much one for chatting and who tends to stay in his store on the south side of town. Some of the locals do muse about having seen him making regular trips to and from the forest to the north, but for the most part, they note that the Darius normally only interacts with other townsfolk when he’s making a supply run for food or a new shipment of bee’s wax for his shop. One bitter-sounding man observes “He seems more interested in hosting parties for his fancy friends from the city than he does being a part of Petalbrook—not sure why he sticks around!”

Anyone in town can direct the PCs to Darius’s shop, “Crystals and Candlewax,” near the village’s southern edge. Treasure: If at least one PC critically succeeded at a check to interact with the villagers, the villagers give each PC a little jar of high-quality honey—these jars of exquisite honey each function as a lesser elixir of life.

Read or paraphrase the following when the PCs enter Crystals and Candlewax.

As the shop’s door swings open, a crystalline wind chime rings pleasantly. Far less pleasant is the shop’s overpowering aroma of jasmine flowers, which rises like a curtain across the threshold. Crystals of all shapes and sizes are displayed in fine glass cabinets and hung from the ceiling, while colorful candles adorn shelves that line the walls and floor.

When the PCs arrive, the person managing the storefront, Galan (N male human shopkeeper 1), is startled by their appearances. After openly staring at them, he composes himself and clears his throat, “I’m terribly sorry, it’s just I’ve never seen a walking talking plant before. Are you... customers? Can I help you?”

Galan is happy to show the PCs around and talk up the shop’s wares. If the PCs ask about the odor of jasmine or the candles, he claims that jasmine candles are mystically connected with youth, beauty, and vitality, and that his boss Darius believes that they’re about to become very popular among noble ladies. If the PCs succeed at a DC 18 Perception check to Sense Motive on Galan, they discern that he has indeed never seen a leshy before. They also notice that despite his promotion of jasmine candles, he seems to be sick of the smell.

If the PCs ask to see Darius, Galan apologizes and informs them that his boss is currently hard at work in the basement on a new batch of jasmine candles, and he is not to be disturbed under any circumstances. After all, it’s hot and delicate work.

The PCs can use a variety of strategies to reach the basement, using a wide range of DC 18 skill checks to do so. For example, a PC might create a diversion by feigning interest in wares or engaging Galan in a deep conversation with a Deception check while another PC uses Stealth to sneak over to the door followed by Thievery to Pick the Lock leading to the basement. Alternatively, the PCs could use skill checks, such as Diplomacy to convince him that they should be allowed to investigate Darius for potential involvement in the disappearance of some of their companions, or Intimidation to simply bully their way past him. Whatever solution the PCs use, three successful skill checks are enough to bypass the shopkeeper and gain access to the basement.

If all else fails, the PCs can force their way into the basement by breaking the door (Hardness 10, HP 40, BT 20). This direct approach frightens off Galan, who runs into the street in search of guards. Finding guards in the sleepy village takes some time, however, and as long as they don’t dawdle, the PCs should have plenty of time to conduct their basement business.

Finally, the PCs can opt to wait until night to move in and explore the shop after Galan heads home for the night (it’s only a DC 16 Thievery check to Pick the Lock on the front door). Darius remains downstairs all night in any event, but in this case, increase their delayed condition to 4 (the maximum).

### A1. CRYSTAL ROOM TRIVIAL 3

A wooden table covered with crystals of various size, including three particularly large ones measuring nearly four feet in diameter, sits against the southern wall of this storeroom. Stairs lead up to the north, while a wooden door is tucked into the wall to the southwest.

Darius uses this storage area to keep the crystals he thinks are most likely to interest members of the various secret societies he hopes to some day join. He also tries exposing these crystals to various alchemical substances to create colors or patterns that could make them more valuable.

Hazard: In his experiments on the crystals, Darius very recently stumbled across a method that allows the larger crystals to store sound and discharge it when triggered by additional noises. He’s attuned the crystals so that neither he nor his homunculi trigger them but hasn’t been able to replicate the effect yet, so in the meantime, he has kept the crystals here as a bit of added security.

==BAD VIBRATIONS==


### A2. WAX LABORATORY MODERATE 3 

[[npc - Darius Wick 2.png|Show to Players]]
![[npc - Darius Wick 2.png|right]]

> [!note]+ Read Aloud
> The concentrated smell of flowers in this spacious laboratory is somehow even stronger than it was upstairs. Long wooden tables along the south wall are covered with candles. A large, unlit stone fireplace takes up the room’s rounded southwest corner. The north wall features two rounded tables, one holding a cauldron of stew and the other riddled with burn marks and covered in wax. Similar scorch marks and splatters appear on the floor at the center of the room, beneath a massive cauldron of gently bubbling wax. Next to the bubbling cauldron, a towering set of sturdy wooden shelves are laden with a hodgepodge of tools for candle making and alchemy. Three doors lead out of this room, two along the east wall and a third in the northwest corner.

The ceiling of this stone room is 15 feet high. Its central feature, the bubbling cauldron, is filled with jasmine-scented wax. The homunculi in this room can use this cauldron to heal themselves unless a character Shoves it over (==DC 15 Athletics==). Toppling the cauldron creates difficult terrain in the cauldron’s square and all adjacent squares but stops the homunculi from using this strategy.

Next to the wax cauldron, the sturdy shelves are strong enough to bear the PCs’ weight; they can Climb up onto the top shelf with a ==DC 15 Athletics== check.

Darius can’t reach a character on the top shelf with melee Strikes, but the shelf can be toppled over with a successful Shove (==DC 18 Athletics==). A character atop the shelf when it’s toppled must attempt a ==DC 15 Reflex== save, landing prone and taking 1d6 points of bludgeoning damage on a failed save.

The stewpot on the table is half-filled with a bland, tepid, undercooked vegetable stew seasoned with an excessive amount of salt. Darius’s long exposure to overpowering candle fumes has deadened his sense of smell.

**Creatures:** Darius Wick allows no one but his homunculi to enter his laboratory and immediately reacts to intruders with violence. It’s likely that he heard the PCs approaching down the stairs (especially if the trap in area A1 went off), in which case he drinks his moderate bestial mutagen just before they entered the room. If the PCs both avoided setting off the trap and Sneaked up to his door, he’s caught by surprise and must instead spend his first action drinking the mutagen. He was in the process of pouring small candles from his handheld wax pourer before the PCs arrived.

```encounter
name: Darius Wick
creatures:
 - 1: Alchemist
```

In combat, he exploits a flaw in the pourer to convert it into an improvised hot wax sprayer. His loyal pair of homunculus lab assistants flap to his aid when combat starts. The homunculi fight until destroyed, while Darius attempts to flee up the stairs if reduced to 10 Hit Points or fewer.

If the PCs manage to capture Darius alive and question him, the alchemist agrees to speak if the PCs promise to spare his life and leave his shop as soon as he answers their questions, but any amount of additional threat causes him to cave in and speak automatically. He admits to abducting a number of leshys from the Verduran Forest on behalf of a noblewoman named Lady Constance Meliosa of the nearby town of Rosentry, but he claims that he did so only under duress and bitterly observes that “she didn’t even invite me to the party she’s throwing tomorrow to show off her new leshys!”

A PC who doubts his claim and succeeds at a DC 18 Perception check to Sense Motive notices that while his confession of stealing the leshys for Lady Constance is accurate, his claim that his actions were forced was not. In truth, Darius was motivated by profit. He believed Lady Constance’s assurance that the plant creatures he would be capturing were less intelligent than the average animal, and when their behavior during capture started to suggest otherwise, he pushed such thoughts aside and put his trust in the beliefs that would line his pockets.

Darius hopes that by currying favor with Lady Constance he can eventually “buy” his way in to her inner circle. His alchemical skills are largely self-taught and focused more on mutagens, the creation of homunculi, and potential alchemical properties of wax—as such, he lacks any real ability with bombs or elixirs or other typical alchemical pursuits.

==DARIUS CREATURE 3==

### A3. DARIUS’S BEDROOM

The fine furnishings and imported Qadiran carpet in this bedroom are marred by soot and wax stains.

If the PCs Search the desk, they find Darius’s shipping manifests and accounts. Among the meticulous descriptions of crystals, candles, and alchemical concoctions, one entry stands out: a recent order for “house plants—lavender” made by Lady Constance Meliosa, successfully delivered very recently by hand to her manor in the nearby town of Rosentry. These same notes make clear that this order is to be a centerpiece for an upcoming gala hosted in her estate’s garden the very next day after the PCs read this note!

### A4. CLUTTERED STOREROOM

This cluttered room is packed with alchemical tools in various states of repair, prototype candles, and fragments of crystals.

Treasure: If the PCs Search the room and succeed at a DC 15 Crafting check or a DC 20 Perception check, they can sort through the clutter to find a few valuable items that Darius had brewed for later sale: two moderate cognitive mutagens and two moderate quicksilver mutagens.
