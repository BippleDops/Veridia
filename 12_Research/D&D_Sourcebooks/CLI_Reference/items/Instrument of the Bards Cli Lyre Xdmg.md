# Instrument of the Bards, Cli Lyre
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/cli-lyre.webp#right)

An Instrument of the Bards is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `2d4` Psychic damage.

You can play the Cli [[lyre-xphb|Lyre]] to cast one of the following spells: [[fly-xphb|Fly]], [[invisibility-xphb|Invisibility]], [[levitate-xphb|Levitate]], [[protection-from-evil-and-good-xphb|Protection from Evil and Good]], [[stone-shape-xphb|Stone Shape]], [[wall-of-fire-xphb|Wall of Fire]], and [[wind-wall-xphb|Wind Wall]]. Once the Cli [[lyre-xphb|Lyre]] has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
