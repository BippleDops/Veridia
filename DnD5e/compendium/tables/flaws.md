| During stressful times, I find myself crying for no reason. |

| I can't resist a clever riddle. |
| My family is prominent in another guild. I enjoy my wild life, but I don't want to embarrass them. |
| I am a moocher. I am so used to others providing for me that I have come to expect everyone to do it. |

| I'm convinced that I'm better and stronger than members of other guilds, isolated as they are from the realities of life and death. |

| I'm always changing my mind—well, almost always. |
| It's not stealing if I need it more than someone else. |

| Prone to rage |
| I am secretly jealous of the freedom that mortals enjoy. |

| My religious beliefs aren't widespread in my house. |

| I assume everyone is lying to me, even my most trusted allies, and constantly test their loyalty. |

| It doesn't take much to get me into a fight. |
| I strongly dislike enclosed spaces and require intoxication or firm encouragement to enter them. |
| Your mark is a source of constant physical pain. |

| I do not trust anyone who has not had a hard life.  |
| I'm obsessed with conspiracy theories and worried about secret societies and hidden demons. |

| I have many vices and tend to indulge them. |
| My supposed allies are my first victims. |
| I believe everyone has a price and am cynical toward those who present themselves as virtuous. |
| I am unable to keep secrets. A secret is just an untold story. |
| I've been lying so often and for so long that I can't help it anymore. I frequently lie for no reason at all. |
| I rage, but I use anger to distract from my fear of confrontation. |
| I follow orders, even if I think they're wrong. |
| If people find me unpleasant, that's their problem. |
| I'm always in debt. I spend my ill-gotten gains on decadent luxuries faster than I bring them in. |

| My hatred of my enemies is blinding and unreasoning. |
| I secretly believe things would be better if I was in charge. |
| The lesser creatures of the world have no souls |
| You don't know what I'm going through. You never can. |
| I'm forgetful. Sometimes I can't remember even the simplest things. |
| I can't afford to trust anyone. Not. Anyone. |
| Once I decide on a course of action, I do not waiver. |
| I'm slow to trust members of other guilds. |
| You are very fidgety. Sitting still is a major challenge. |
| I'd risk too much to uncover a lost bit of knowledge. |
| Years of thieving have become habit. I sometimes steal from strangers without thinking about it. |
| I am too eager for gossip. |
| I have a calm temperament and let insults roll off my back. |
| I have lived a hard life and find it difficult to empathize with others. |
| I would let my friends die rather than reveal my true identity. |
| I have difficulty caring about anyone or anything other than myself. |

| I'm quick to assume that someone is trying to cheat me. |
| An innocent person is in prison for a crime that I committed. I'm okay with that. |
| I'm afraid of the dark. |
| I will not tell a lie, but I can still say nothing, nod suggestively, or bend the truth a little to suit my needs. |
| I am very prideful and have trouble admitting when I'm wrong. |
| I'm a kleptomaniac who covets shiny, sparkling treasure. |

| I have little respect for anyone who is not a proven warrior. |
| I will never fully trust anyone other than myself. |
| I'm as stubborn as a batterboar. |
| I was once a terribly flawed person, like you. Let me tell you how you can save yourself. |
| Nothing gets between me and danger except my fellow adventurers. So I'll be sure to put them there. |
| I have a weakness for the exotic beauty of the people of these lands. |
| I worship a forbidden god. |
| I have trouble keeping my true feelings hidden. My sharp tongue lands me in trouble. |
| I'm easily distracted by an attractive person, which could be the death of me in the trials. |
| I'm never satisfied with what I have—I always want more. |
| I trust the chain of command more than anything—more even than my closest friends. |
| I must be the captain of any group I join. |
| I like to explore, and my curiosity will sometimes get me into trouble. |

| I would rather be righteously angry at problems than solve them. |
| I always over exaggerate my abilities. |
| No one must ever learn that I once stole money from guild coffers. |
| I once satirized a noble who still wants my head. It was a mistake that I will likely repeat. |
| I'd rather kill someone in their sleep than fight fair. |
| Dependence |
| I think far ahead, a detachedness often mistaken for daydreaming. |
| I judge people based on how well they stand their ground in a fight. I got not time for cowards... |
| I expect others to heed my orders and have little respect or sympathy if they don't. |
| I am still very uncomfortable wearing nice clothes, sleeping in a warm bed, and eating fine food. |
| I get frustrated to the point of distraction by shoddy craftsmanship. |
| I'll take any opportunity to steal from wealthier people, even for worthless trinkets. |
| Why spend gold here when you can buy the same thing for copper in the next town? |
| Gold seems like a lot of money to me, and I'll do just about anything for more of it. |
|  Don't expect me to save those who can't save themselves. It is nature's way that the strong thrive and the weak perish. |
| If there's a plan, I'll forget it. If I don't forget it, I'll ignore it. |
| If I could get away with it, I would gladly kill and eat a superior yuan-ti. |

| I know my future is written and that anything I do will lead to a prophesied end. |
| I've picked up some unpleasant habits living among goblins, lizardfolk, or orcs. |
| I am a glutton. I eat and drink to excess. |
| I'm convinced of the significance of my destiny, and blind to my shortcomings and the risk of failure. |

| Hunger and thirst are unbearable pains to me. |
| I am a secret informant for the Hawks. I send them reports about everything I see and hear, even what my friends and allies are up to. |
| Until my songs are sung in every tavern in this realm, I won't be satisfied. |
| I can't help but pocket loose coins and other trinkets I come across. |
| I consider the adherents of other gods to be deluded innocents at best, or ignorant fools at worst. |
| Shameful or scandalous history |
| I don't know when to quit. Especially when everyone else is telling me to. |
| The Red Plumes caught me once before, and I was branded for my crime. If they catch me again, for any offense, the punishment will be dire. |
| I sometimes stay up all night listening to the ghosts of my fallen enemies. |
| There's right and there's wrong, and there's no gray area in between. |
| Now that I've returned to the world, I enjoy its delights a little too much. |
| I hide a truly scandalous secret that could ruin my family forever. |
| I'd rather eat my armor than admit when I'm wrong. |

| I become irrational when innocent people are hurt. |

| I used the lives of children to facilitate my escape from Phlan. |
| I have a tendency to take shortcuts in my research and any other tasks I have to complete. |
| I took a bribe to tank an investigation and I would do anything to keep it secret. |
| I am haughty. I grew up among the elves and emulate them. Other races are crude in comparison. |
| I have no respect for those who flee. I harbor a deep grudge against the citizens who abandoned Phlan. |
| I am slow to anger, but when I do become enraged I fight until my enemies are dead, no matter the cost. |
| I killed a drunk member of the City Watch in a brawl. I am terrified that they might find out. |
| I folded under the torture, and gave information that I promised would be kept secret. My life would be in jeopardy if others found out. |
| I am obsessed with catching an elusive aquatic beast, often to the detriment of other pursuits. |
| Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment of everything else in my life. |
| There's no room for caution in a life lived to the fullest. |
| Death comes for us all, so you can't expect me to take care of someone who can't fight it off. |
| Being a spy in wartime is painful. I've seen so much suffering, I think I'm losing my mind. |
| Yeah, that's my name. Yeah, I'm a Grinner spy. Who cares about staying undercover? |
| My nerve endings are shot from the interrogations; I am numb to all but the harshest touch. |
| If you question my courage, I will never back down. |
| I'll do anything to get my hands on something rare or priceless. |
| When I'm not exploring dungeons or ruins. I get jittery and impatient. |
| I'm an informant for the Red Plumes. They let me continue my activities, so long as I pass them information about illegal activity in Hillsfar. |
| I don't trust anyone. |
| Your looks change slightly whenever you use the mark. |
| I hold a scandalous secret that could ruin my family forever—but could also earn me the favor of the Ghost Council. |
| I struggle to trust the words of others. |
| Others' concerns bore me, and I would rather have my lessers handle everything possible. |
| I am in love with an initiate, and I want to shield this person from death in the trials. |
| I have an insatiable desire for carnal pleasures. |
| I'm convinced something is after me, appearing in mirrors, dreams, and places where no one could. |
| I have a reputation for defeating a great evil, but that's a lie and the wicked force knows. |
| Years of getting away with minor crimes has left me believing that I am above the law, and have diplomatic immunity above my station. |
| Specific phobia |
| I can't sleep except in total darkness. |
| I've done unspeakable evil and will do anything to prevent others from finding out. |
| I couldn't hide my emotions and opinions even if I wanted to. |
| I have no sense of humor. Laughing is uncomfortable and embarrassing. |
| I am cowed by threats, and even preposterous ones make me pause. |
| I am oblivious to the emotions expressed by others. |
| Survival is worth more than friendship. |
| I'm not at all sure I'll be able to grant a glorified death to any of my crop-mates. |
| There is no difference between what you think and what you say. |
| I believe in the supremacy of the gith and that githzerai and githyanki will align to rule the multiverse. |
| I tend to assess my relationships in terms of profit and loss. |
| I'm terrified of getting into a fight where my side is outnumbered. |
| I have trouble trusting anyone but myself. |
| I work hard, but I play harder. |
| I am too enamored of ale, wine, and other intoxicants. |
| I jealously guard my secrets, because I think others will take advantage of me if they learn what I know. |
| I feel a need for revenge against those who enjoy the privilege of living above ground. |
| It is inconceivable that another creature could outsmart me. |
