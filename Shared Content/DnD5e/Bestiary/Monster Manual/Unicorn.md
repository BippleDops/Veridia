## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting.*** The unicorn's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). The unicorn can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

At will: *detect evil and good, druidcraft, pass without trace*
1/day each: *calm emotions, dispel evil and good, entangle*

***Charge.*** If the unicorn moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and then hits it with a horn attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (`dice: 2d8`) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Magic Resistance.*** The unicorn has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The unicorn's weapon attacks are magical.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The unicorn makes two attacks: one with its hooves and one with its horn.

***Hooves.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (`dice: 2d6+4`) bludgeoning damage.

***Horn.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (`dice: 1d8+4`) piercing damage.

***Healing Touch (3/Day).*** The unicorn touches another creature with its horn. The target magically regains 11 (`dice: 2d8+2`) hit points. In addition, the touch removes all diseases and neutralizes all poisons afflicting the target.

***Teleport (1/Day).*** The unicorn magically teleports itself and up to three willing creatures it can see within 5 ft. of it, along with any equipment they are wearing or carrying, to a location the unicorn is familiar with, up to 1 mile away.

## Description
Unicorns dwell in enchanted forests. Unrelated to the horses it resembles, a unicorn is a celestial creature that wanders sylvan realms, its white form glimmering like starlight.

A unicorn's brow sports a single spiraling horn of ivory whose magical touch can heal the sick and the injured. Its ears catch the words and whispers of the creatures that share its domain, and it knows the tongues of elves and sylvan folk. Unicorns allow good-hearted creatures to enter their woods to hunt or gather food, but they hold evil ever at bay. Foul-hearted creatures seldom leave a unicorn's domain alive.
