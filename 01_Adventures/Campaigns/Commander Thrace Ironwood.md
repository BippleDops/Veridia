**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).** If Thrace fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead.

**Crystal Corruption Sense.** Thrace can detect the presence of crystal corruption within 120 feet, including corrupted creatures, unstable crystal formations, and shadow-tainted areas.

**Tactical Genius.** Thrace and all allies within 60 feet gain a +2 bonus to initiative rolls. As a bonus action, he can grant one ally within 60 feet advantage on their next attack roll or saving throw.

**Unbreakable Will.** Thrace cannot be turned against his cause by magical or supernatural means. Any attempt to charm, dominate, or otherwise control him automatically fails.

**Crystal Bane Weapons.** All of Thrace's weapon attacks deal an additional `dice: `dice: 2d6`` force damage to crystal constructs, corrupted creatures, or anyone using crystal-powered magic items.

**Spellcasting.** Thrace is a 11th-level spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save **DC 18**, +10 to hit with spell attacks). He knows the following spells:

- **1st level (4 slots):** command, compelled duel, cure wounds, divine favor
- **2nd level (3 slots):** aid, hold person, zone of truth
- **3rd level (3 slots):** counterspell, dispel magic, spirit guardians
- **4th level (2 slots):** freedom of movement, locate creature

### Actions

**Multiattack.** Thrace makes three attacks with Ironwood's Wrath, or two weapon attacks and casts a spell.

**Ironwood's Wrath (Longsword +3).** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (`dice: `dice: 1d8`` + 8) slashing damage plus 7 (`dice: `dice: 2d6``) force damage. If the target is using crystal-powered abilities or equipment, they must succeed on a **DC 18** Constitution saving throw or have their crystal items temporarily disrupted for 1 minute.

**Crystal Disruption Grenade (3/Day).** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 60/120 ft., 20-foot radius. All creatures in the area must make a **DC 18** Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 21 (`dice: `dice: 6d6``) thunder damage and are deafened for 1 minute. Crystal constructs and crystal-powered magical effects in the area are automatically disrupted for 10 minutes.

**Inspiring Command (Recharge 5-6).** Thrace shouts a tactical order. All allies within 60 feet gain 15 temporary hit points and can immediately move up to their speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Purifier's Judgment (1/Day).** Thrace marks one creature within 60 feet as an enemy of purity. For the next minute, all attacks against that creature by Thrace and his allies deal an additional `dice: `dice: 1d8`` radiant damage, and the target has disadvantage on saving throws against effects from Thrace and his allies.

### Legendary Actions (3 per turn)
Thrace can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn.

**Move.** Thrace moves up to his speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Attack.** Thrace makes one weapon attack.

**Tactical Assessment.** Thrace makes an Investigation or Perception check, or uses his Crystal Corruption Sense.

**Command (Costs 2 Actions).** Thrace casts a spell of 2nd level or lower, or uses Inspiring Command if available.

**Coordinated Strike.** All Coalition forces in the area can immediately make one weapon attack against enemies within range.

**Anti-Crystal Field.** Thrace activates Coalition equipment that creates a 60-foot radius zone where all crystal-powered magic items and abilities function at disadvantage for 1 minute.
