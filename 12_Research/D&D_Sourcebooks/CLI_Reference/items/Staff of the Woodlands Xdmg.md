The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. | Spell | Charge Cost |


|-------|-------------|
| [[Animal Friendship Xphb]] | 1 |
| [[Awaken Xphb]] | 5 |
| [[barkskin-xphb (spells)]] | 2 |
| [[Locate Animals or Plants Xphb]] | 2 |

^spell-charge-cost ## Tree Form You can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to plant one end of the staff in earth in an unoccupied space and expend 1 charge to transform the staff into a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of Transmutation magic that can be discerned with the [[detect-magic-xphb (spells)]] spell. While touching the tree and using a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action, you return the staff to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when the tree reverts to a staff. ## Regaining Charges The staff regains`d6`expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll`d20`. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical Quarterstaff. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 311. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* ## Player-Facing Summary Staff of the woodlands xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of staff of the woodlands xdmg as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around staff of the woodlands xdmg. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Second Prophecy of Depths ## Plot Hooks - A stranger needs help finding before winter
