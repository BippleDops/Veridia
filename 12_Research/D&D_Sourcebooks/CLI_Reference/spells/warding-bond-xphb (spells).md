# Warding Bond
*2nd-level, Abjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth 50+ GP each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch another creature that is willing and create a mystic connection between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has [[boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats)]] to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.

The spell ends if you drop to 0 [[hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] or if you and the target become separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the connected creatures.

**Classes**: [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]; [[classes]]
