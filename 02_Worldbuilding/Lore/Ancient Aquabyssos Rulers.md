# Ancient Aquabyssos Rulers
*Chronicles of the Drowned Dynasties*

## Overview

Before the establishment of the [[Parliament of Echoes]], [[Aquabyssos]] was ruled by a series of monarchs whose reigns spanned from the pre-drowning era through the tumultuous centuries following [[The Great Drowning]]. These rulers, known collectively as the Drowned Dynasties, shaped the underwater civilization through periods of survival, adaptation, expansion, and eventually, the transition to democratic governance.

The records of these ancient rulers are fragmented, preserved in [[Memory Meadows Black Market|memory pearls]], coral-carved monuments, and the [[Abyssal Academy]] archives. Many details have been lost to time, aboleth manipulation, and the chaos of the early drowning years.

## The Pre-Drowning Dynasty (Lost Era)

### Emperor Nereon the Tidecaller (Dates Lost)
*"The Last Surface Emperor"*
- Ruled the coastal kingdom that would become Aquabyssos

**Legendary Artifacts:**
- **The Crown of Storms**: Said to control weather patterns (current location unknown)
- **The Tidecaller's Trident**: Ancient weapon with power over water (possibly the [[Tide Turner's Trident]])

### The Lost Princes
References exist to Emperor Nereon's children, but their names and fates remain mysteries. [[Memory Merchant Valeria]] claims to possess memory pearls containing their stories, offered at astronomical prices to scholars from the [[Abyssal Academy]].

## Game Mechanics (D&D 5e)

### Ancient Royal Artifacts
Powerful items from these rulers occasionally surface in campaigns:
- **Crown of Nereon**: Controls weather in 10-mile radius (Legendary, requires attunement)
- **Tethys's Adaptation Circlet**: Grants permanent water breathing and pressure immunity (Very Rare)

### Ancient Sites & Ruins
**Royal Tombs**: Hidden burial sites containing treasures and historical records
**Lost Palaces**: Submerged ruins from different dynastic periods

### Quest Opportunities
- Archaeological expeditions to locate lost royal sites

- Uncovering suppressed historical records about controversial rulers

## Modern Impact & Legacy

### Political Influence
Modern [[Parliament of Echoes]] still references ancient royal precedents in legal decisions, particularly those established by Emperor Thalassius the Wise.

### Cultural Memory
Royal festivals and commemorations continue throughout [[Aquabyssos]], serving as opportunities for historical education and cultural unity.

### Diplomatic Protocol
[[Aquabyssos Ambassadors]] still use ceremonial elements derived from Empress Marina's diplomatic innovations.

### Academic Research
The [[Abyssal Academy]] maintains active research programs studying ancient royal periods, though access to certain records requires special clearance.

## Quest Hooks

1. **The Lost Crown**: Ancient royal regalia surfaces in [[Port Meridian]], sparking international incident
2. **The Succession Claim**: Distant descendant claims legitimate right to rule Aquabyssos
3. **The Hidden Tomb**: Expedition discovers Emperor Hadal's sealed burial chamber with disturbing contents
4. **The Royal Conspiracy**: Evidence suggests one ancient ruler may have faked their death
5. **The Memory War**: Different factions fight over access to royal memory pearls containing state secrets
6. **The Diplomatic Crisis**: Ancient treaty obligations surface, affecting modern international relations
7. **The Royal Artifact**: Powerful royal relic begins affecting its surroundings in dangerous ways
8. **The Legitimacy Question**: Political rivals use ancient royal precedents to challenge current government
9. **The Archaeological Fraud**: Fake royal artifacts threaten to rewrite accepted history
10. **The Royal Ghost**: Spectral ancient ruler appears with warnings about current threats to [[Aquabyssos]]

## Scholarly Debates

### The Nereon Question
Did the first emperor truly control storms, or were these exaggerated accounts of advanced weather magic?

### The Hadal Mystery
Emperor Hadal's disappearance and connections to aboleths remain contentious subjects among historians.

### The Transition Paradox
How voluntary was Emperor Benthicus's abdication, and did external pressures influence the shift to democracy?

### The Artifact Authenticity
Many supposed royal artifacts may be later creations; distinguishing genuine relics from skilled forgeries challenges researchers.
