## Special Traits
**Lunge:** A ghost ammonite can extend its reach to 15 feet at will, but if it does, attacks against it have tactical advantage until the start of the ghost ammonite's next turn.

**Shell Retreat:** If a ghost ammonite suffers radiant damage, it retreats into its shell for `dice: 1d6` rounds. While withdrawn inside its shell, its AC increases to 16 and it heals 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns, but it can't attack.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A ghost ammonite attacks three times with tentacles.

**Tentacle:** *Melee Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (`dice: 2d4+2`) necrotic damage and the target's maximum number of hit points is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any (but chiefly, the Plateau of Leng)

**Organization**: Solitary, haunt (2–5), or fossil bed (10–100)

## Description
Unlike Leng-fossils, which are virtually unique to the Leng Plateau, ghost-ammonites are the remnants of some unspeakably ancient race that once traveled freely through many planes of existence—or so believe those rare scholars who’ve dared to study the enigmatic realm of Leng. Their wide travels explain the fact that they can be found literally anywhere. In life, they possessed genius-level intellects, but their ghostly remnants have been reduced to idiocy, propelled by little more than hatred and instinct.

Ghost ammonites are truly undead, unlike the fossils of Leng. These sixtentacled creatures are incorporeal and almost invulnerable to damage of any kind, but their spiraling, fossilized shells are real stone. If the shell is destroyed, the ghost-ammonite inside is destroyed along with it.

For reasons unknown, ghost ammonites often lie quiescent for centuries, usually in layers of earth thick with fossils. They become active for as long as a century or two before returning to eons-long hibernation deep within the alien rock, where they dream of unknown, unquiet realities.
