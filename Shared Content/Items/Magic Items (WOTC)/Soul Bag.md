# Soul Bag

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** very rare

## Description

When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a [[night hag]]'s Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).
