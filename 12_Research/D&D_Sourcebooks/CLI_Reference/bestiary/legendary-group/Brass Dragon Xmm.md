## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The area containing an adult or ancient brass dragon's lair is altered by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Mirages.** While in its lair, the dragon can cast [[major image xphb|Major Image]], requiring no Material components and using the same spellcasting ability as its Spellcasting action. When casting the spell this way, the spell's range is 1 mile, and the dragon doesn't need to see the spot where the illusion appears.  
- **Refreshing Water.** Water within 1 mile of the lair is magically refreshing. A creature that drinks such water gains `2d4` [[temporary hit points xphb|Temporary Hit Points]], and the dragon is immediately aware of the creature's presence.  

If the dragon dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
