--- # Complete Pressure Adaptation System

*The Ultimate Guide to Evolution Under Pressure* > **For the Table - Safety First:** This system includes body horror elements. Always check with players about comfort levels. Use the "Narrative Adaptation" option for players who want mechanical benefits without descriptive transformation. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Table of Contents

Every 100 feet of depth adds approximately 3 atmospheres of pressure, but in this world, pressure also carries metaphysical weight that can alter the fundamental nature of existence. ### Adaptation Points (AP) System **Adaptation Points** represent your body's capacity to change and evolve. They are earned through: | Source | AP Gained | Frequency | Risk |

|--------|-----------|-----------|------|
| Natural Exposure | 1 AP | Per week at depth | Low |
| Forced Adaptation | `dice: 1d4` AP | Per day of extreme exposure | High |
| Symbiotic Integration | `dice: 2d4` AP | Per parasite accepted | Extreme |
| Technological Augmentation | `dice: 1d6` AP | Per modification | Moderate |
| Deep Mother's Blessing | `dice: 3d6` AP | Per vision embraced | Variable |
| Memory Absorption | 1 AP | Per depth memory consumed | Low |
| Ritual Transformation | 10 AP | One-time ceremony | Guaranteed | ### Adaptation Stages Your total AP determines your overall adaptation stage: | Stage | AP Required | Depth Limit | Changes |

|-------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **Surface-Bound** | 0 | 30ft | Baseline human |
| **Shallow Adapted** | 10 | 500ft | Minor changes |
| **Depth Walker** | 25 | 1,500ft | Visible modifications |
| **Pressure Born** | 50 | 4,000ft | Major alterations |
| **Depth Speaker** | 75 | 10,000ft | Inhuman features |
| **Abyss Touched** | 100 | 20,000ft | Transcendent form |
| **Deep Merged** | 150 | Unlimited | One with the depths | ### Adaptation Resistance Not everyone adapts equally. Your **Adaptation Resistance** determines how your body responds: **Base Resistance** = 10 + Constitution modifier + Wisdom modifier | Resistance | Effect |

|-----------|--------|
| 0-5 | Hyper-adaptive: Double AP gains, unstable mutations |
| 6-10 | Receptive: Normal AP gains, controlled changes |
| 11-15 | Resistant: Half AP gains, fewer mutations |
| 16-20 | Stubborn: Quarter AP gains, minimal change |
| 21+ | Immutable: No natural adaptation possible | ## Safety Tools & Player Agency > **For the Table:** These options ensure all players can engage with the system comfortably. ### Narrative Adaptation Mode

Players uncomfortable with body horror can choose "Narrative Adaptation":
- Gain mechanical benefits without physical description
- Changes described as "auras," "spiritual evolution," or "pressure attunement"
- Same game effects, different narrative framing
- Player decides how much detail they're comfortable with ### The Veil System

**Green Light:** Full description okay
**Yellow Light:** Mechanical effects only, minimal description **Red Light:** Skip this content entirely, use alternate progression ### Recovery & Reversal Options > **For the Table - Giving Players Control:**

> - **Stabilization Rituals:** Pause adaptation at any stage (500gp components, 8-hour ritual)

> - **Regression Therapy:** Reverse `dice: 1d4` AP per week with medical treatment (100gp/week)
> - **Divine Intervention:** Clerics can halt/reverse with Greater Restoration
> - **Technological Suppression:** Pressure suits prevent further adaptation
> - **The Surface Cure:** Extended surface time (1 month+) reverses most changes ### Consent Checkpoints

Before major transformations, always ask:
1. "Are you okay with this change?"
2. "How would you like it described?"
3. "Do you want to explore reversal options?" ### Alternative Progression Paths

For players opting out of transformation:
- **Pressure Mastery:** Mental techniques for depth resistance
- **Technological Reliance:** Enhanced equipment instead of body changes
- **Symbiotic Partnership:** External creature provides adaptation
- **Magical Warding:** Protective spells replace physical change #### 1. The Natural Path (Biological Evolution)

Embrace organic transformation through exposure and acceptance. Your body becomes one with the depths through gradual metamorphosis. **Core Philosophy**: "The flesh is clay, pressure is the sculptor"
**Advantages**: No maintece, natural immunities, instinctive abilities
**Disadvantages**: Irreversible, socially isolating, loss of humanity #### 2. The Constructed Path (Technological Modification)

Use technology to overcome biological limitations. Pressure suits, implants, and mechanical augmentations preserve your humanity while granting depth access. **Core Philosophy**: "Master the depths, don't become them"
**Advantages**: Reversible, upgradeable, socially acceptable
**Disadvantages**: Expensive, requires maintece, can malfunction #### 3. The Synthesis Path (Hybrid Adaptation)

Combine biological and technological approaches, using technology to guide and control biological changes. **Core Philosophy**: "Evolution guided by intelligence"
**Advantages**: Best of both worlds, controlled transformation
**Disadvantages**: Complex management, expensive, requires expertise #### Tier 1: Basic Adaptations (10-24 AP) **Thickened Skin** (10 AP)

- [[Reality Merger Mechanics - Cross-dimensional adaptations --- *In the depths, pressure shapes all things. Whether you embrace it, resist it, or transcend it defines not just your body, but your very existence. Choose wisely, for each adaptation is a step away from what you were and toward what you might become.* ## Player-Facing Summary Complete Pressure Adaptation System is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Complete Pressure Adaptation System as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Complete Pressure Adaptation System. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Related Notes - [Similar Topic 1]]
