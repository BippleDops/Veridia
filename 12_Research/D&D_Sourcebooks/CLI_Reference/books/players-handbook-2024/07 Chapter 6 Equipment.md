# Chapter 6: Equipment
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024), p. 213* 

![[/03_Mechanics/CLI/books/players-handbook-2024/img/168-07-001-inventor-vi.webp#center "In the skies of Eberron, the inventor Vi and her Fixers escape the Lord of Blades and a plummeting airship that burns with green flame!"|In the skies of Eberron, t...]]

The right equipment can make the difference between success and failure for adventurers. This chapter provides rules and prices for weapons, armor, and other kinds of equipment that characters might purchase or find. The DM lets you know if a shop has an item for sale and whether it's available at the listed price.

## Coins

Characters often find coins on their adventures and can spend those coins in shops, inns, and other businesses. Coins come in different denominations based on the relative worth of their material. The Coin Values table lists coins and how much they're worth relative to the Gold Piece, which is the game's main coin. For example, 100 Copper Pieces are worth 1 Gold Piece.

A coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins weigh a pound.

> [!note] Selling Equipment
> 
> Equipment fetches half its cost when sold. In contrast, trade goods and valuables—like gems and art objects—retain their full value in the marketplace. The *Dungeon Master's Guide* has prices for magic items.

## Weapons

The Weapons table in this section shows the game's main weapons. The table lists the cost and weight of each weapon, as well as the following details:

- **Category.** Every weapon falls into a category: Simple or Martial. Weapon proficiencies are usually tied to one of these categories. For example, you might have proficiency with Simple weapons.  
- **Melee or Ranged.** A weapon is classified as either Melee or Ranged. A Melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet, whereas a Ranged weapon is used to attack at a greater distance.  
- **Damage.** The table lists the amount of damage a weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well as the type of that damage.  
- **Properties.** Any properties a weapon has are listed in the Properties column. Each property is defined in the ""Properties"" section.  
- **Mastery.** Each weapon has a mastery property, which is defined in the ""Mastery Properties"" section later in this chapter. To use that property, you must have a feature that lets you use it.

### Weapon Proficiency

Anyone can wield a weapon, but you must have proficiency with it to add your Proficiency Bonus to an attack roll you make with it. A player character's features can provide weapon proficiencies. A monster is proficient with any weapon in its stat block.

### Properties

Here are definitions of the properties in the Properties column of the Weapons table.

#### Ammunition

You can use a weapon that has the Ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from it. The type of ammunition required is specified with the weapon's range. Each attack expends one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). After a fight, you can spend 1 minute to recover half the ammunition (round down) you used in the fight; the rest is lost.

#### Finesse

When making an attack with a Finesse weapon, use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.

#### Heavy

You have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on attack rolls with a Heavy weapon if it's a Melee weapon and your Strength score isn't at least 13 or if it's a Ranged weapon and your Dexterity score isn't at least 13.

> [!note] Improvised Weapons
> 
> If you use an object—such as a table leg, frying pan, or bottle—as a makeshift weapon, see "[[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/improvised-weapons-xphb|Improvised Weapons]]" in the "rules glossary". Also see those rules if you wield a weapon in an unusual way, such as using a Ranged weapon to make a melee attack.
^improvised-weapons

#### Light

When you take the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Attack|Attack]] action on your turn and attack with a Light weapon, you can make one extra attack as a Bonus Action later on the same turn. That extra attack must be made with a different Light weapon, and you don't add your ability modifier to the extra attack's damage unless that modifier is negative. For example, you can attack with a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/shortsword-xphb|Shortsword]] in one hand and a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/dagger-xphb|Dagger]] in the other using the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Attack|Attack]] action and a Bonus Action, but you don't add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll of the Bonus Action unless that modifier is negative.

#### Loading

You can fire only one piece of ammunition from a Loading weapon when you use an action, a Bonus Action, or a Reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

#### Range

A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties#Ammunition|Ammunition]] or [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties#Thrown|Thrown]] property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second is the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the long range.

#### Reach

A Reach weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Opportunity%20Attack|Opportunity Attacks]] with it.

#### Thrown

If a weapon has the Thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack, and you can draw that weapon as part of the attack. If the weapon is a Melee weapon, use the same ability modifier for the attack and damage rolls that you use for a melee attack with that weapon.

#### Two-Handed

A Two-Handed weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.

#### Versatile

A Versatile weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property. The weapon deals that damage when used with two hands to make a melee attack.

### Mastery Properties

Each weapon has a mastery property, which is usable only by a character who has a feature, such as Weapon Mastery, that unlocks the property for the character. The properties are defined below.

#### Cleave

If you hit a creature with a melee attack roll using this weapon, you can make a melee attack roll with the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet of the first that is also within your reach. On a hit, the second creature takes the weapon's damage, but don't add your ability modifier to that damage unless that modifier is negative. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

#### Graze

If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can be increased only by increasing the ability modifier.

#### Nick

When you make the extra attack of the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/item-properties#Light|Light]] property, you can make it as part of the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Attack|Attack]] action instead of as a Bonus Action. You can make this extra attack only once per turn.

#### Push

If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from yourself if it is Large or smaller.

#### Sap

If you hit a creature with this weapon, that creature has [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on its next attack roll before the start of your next turn.

#### Slow

If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to it, you can reduce its Speed by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. If the creature is hit more than once by weapons that have this property, the Speed reduction doesn't exceed 10 feet.

#### Topple

If you hit a creature with this weapon, you can force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 plus the ability modifier used to make the attack roll and your Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, the creature has the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Prone|Prone]] condition.

#### Vex

If you hit a creature with this weapon and deal damage to the creature, you have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on your next attack roll against that creature before the end of your next turn.

## Armor

The Armor table lists the game's main armor. The table includes the cost and weight of armor, as well as the following details:

- **Category.** Every type of armor falls into a category: Light, Medium, or Heavy. The category determines how long it takes to don or doff the armor (as shown in the table).  

**Armor Class (AC**). The table's Armor Class column tells you what your base AC is when you wear a type of armor. For example, if you wear Leather Armor, your base AC is 11 plus your Dexterity modifier, whereas your AC is 16 in Chain Mail.

- **Strength.** If the table shows a Strength score in the Strength column for an armor type, that armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.  
- **Stealth.** If the table shows "Disadvantage" in the Stealth column for an armor type, the wearer has [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on Dexterity ([[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Stealth|Stealth]]) checks.  

![[/03_Mechanics/CLI/tables/armor-xphb|Armor]]

![[/03_Mechanics/CLI/books/players-handbook-2024/img/173-07-062-light-armor-and-shields.webp#center|Light Armor and Shields]]

![[/03_Mechanics/CLI/books/players-handbook-2024/img/174-07-063-medium-armor.webp#center|Medium Armor]]

![[/03_Mechanics/CLI/books/players-handbook-2024/img/175-07-064-heavy-armor.webp#center|Heavy Armor]]

### Armor Training

Anyone can don armor or hold a Shield, but only those with training can use them effectively, as explained below. A character's class and other features determine the character's armor training. A monster has training with any armor in its stat block.

#### Light, Medium, or Heavy Armor

If you wear Light, Medium, or Heavy armor and lack training with it, you have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on any [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb|D20 Test]] that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.

#### Shield

You gain the Armor Class benefit of a Shield only if you have training with it.

### One at a Time

A creature can wear only one suit of armor at a time and wield only one Shield at a time.

> [!note] Variant: Equipment Sizes
> 
> In most campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on your adventures, within the bounds of common sense. For example, an orc adventurer won't fit in a halfling's Leather Armor, and a cloud giant's robe would be far too large for a gnome.
> 
> The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of Plate Armor made for one human might not fit another one without significant alterations, and a guard's uniform might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries to wear it as a disguise.
> 
> Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing, and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit a smith, a tailor, a leatherworker, or a similar expert to make the item wearable. The cost for such work is `1d4 × 10` percent of the market price of the item.

## Tools

A tool helps you make specialized ability checks, craft certain items, or both. A tool's description includes the tool's cost and weight, as well as the following entries:

- **Ability.** This entry lists the ability to use when making an ability check with the tool.  
- **Utilize.** This entry lists things you can do with the tool when you take the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action. You can do one of those things each time you take the action. This entry also provides the DC for the action.  
- **Craft.** This entry lists what, if anything, you can craft with the tool. For crafting rules, see ""Crafting Equipment"" later in the chapter.  
- **Variants.** This entry appears if the tool has variants, which are listed. Each requires a separate proficiency.  

![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/books/players-handbook-2024/img/176-07-002-tools.webp#center)

### Tool Proficiency

If you have proficiency with a tool, add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check you make that uses the tool. If you have proficiency in a skill that's used with that check, you have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on the check too.

Your features might give you proficiency with a tool. A monster has proficiency with any tool in its stat block.

Barding is armor designed for a mount. Any type of armor on the "Armor table" in this chapter can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the normal cost, and it weighs twice as much.

### Saddles

A saddle comes with a bit, a bridle, reins, and any other equipment needed to use the saddle. A Military Saddle gives [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on any ability check you make to remain mounted. An Exotic Saddle is required for riding an aquatic or a flying mount.

### Large Vehicles

The Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles table provides statistics for various types of large vehicles. The following notes apply.

#### Speed

A ship sailing against a strong wind moves at half speed. In a dead calm (no wind), waterborne ships can't move under sail and must be rowed. Keelboats and Rowboats are used on lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically 3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can't be rowed against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals on the shores. A Rowboat can be carried and weighs 100 pounds.

#### Crew

A ship larger than a Keelboat or Rowboat needs a crew of skilled hirelings (see ""Services"" later in this chapter) to function. The minimum number of skilled hirelings needed to crew a ship depends on the type of ship, as shown in the table.

#### Passengers

The table lists the number of Small and Medium passengers the ship can accommodate using hammocks. A ship outfitted with private accommodations can carry one-fifth as many passengers. A passenger usually pays 5 SP per day for a hammock, but prices can vary from ship to ship. A small private cabin usually costs 2 GP per day.

#### Damage Threshold

If a vehicle has a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/damage-threshold-xphb|damage threshold]], it's noted in the table.

#### Ship Repair

Repairs to a damaged ship can be made while the vessel is berthed. Repairing 1 Hit Point of damage requires 1 day and costs 20 GP for materials and labor. If the repairs are made in a location where supplies and skilled labor are abundant, such as a city shipyard, the repair time and cost are halved.

This section outlines services and other expenses that adventurers might spend money on.

### Lifestyle Expenses

Lifestyle expenses summarize the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover lodging, food, equipment maintenance, and other necessities.

At the start of each week or month (DM's choice), choose a lifestyle below—Wretched, Squalid, Poor, Modest, Comfortable, Wealthy, or Aristocratic—and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle.

Lifestyles have no inherent consequences, but the DM might take them into account when determining risks or how others perceive your character.

#### Wretched (Free)

You survive via chance and charity. You're often exposed to natural dangers as a result of sleeping outside.

#### Squalid (1 SP per Day)

You spend the bare minimum for your necessities. You might be exposed to unhealthy conditions and opportunistic criminals.

#### Poor (2 SP per Day)

You spend frugally for your necessities.

#### Modest (1 GP per Day)

You support yourself at an average level.

#### Comfortable (2 GP per Day)

You spend modestly for your necessities and enjoy a few luxuries.

#### Wealthy (4 GP per Day)

You're accustomed to the finer things in life and might have servants.

#### Aristocratic (10 GP per Day)

You pay for the best and might have a staff that supports your lifestyle. Others notice your wealth and might encourage you to share it, either legally or otherwise.

### Food, Drink, and Lodging

The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for food and a single night's lodging. Prices for daily lodging and meals are included in your lifestyle's expenses.

![[/03_Mechanics/CLI/tables/food-drink-and-lodging-xphb|Food, Drink, and Lodging]]

### Travel

Drivers or crew hired to conduct passengers to their destinations charge the rates on the Travel table, plus any tolls or additional expenses.

![[/03_Mechanics/CLI/tables/travel-xphb|Travel]]

### Hirelings

Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, an artisan, a scribe, or the like. The pay shown on the Hirelings table is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for work that requires no particular proficiencies; they include laborers and porters.

![[/03_Mechanics/CLI/tables/hirelings-xphb|Hirelings]]

### Spellcasting

Most settlements contain individuals who are willing to cast spells in exchange for payment. If a spell has expensive components, add the cost of those components to the cost listed in the Spellcasting Services table. The higher the level of a desired spell, the harder it is to find someone to cast it.

![[/03_Mechanics/CLI/tables/spellcasting-services-xphb|Spellcasting Services]]

## Magic Items

Adventures hold the promise—but not a guarantee—of finding magic items. Hundreds of magic items are detailed in the *Dungeon Master's Guide*, since the DM decides when you find such an item. Here's what you need to know about using magic items.

### Identifying a Magic Item

Some magic items are indistinguishable from their nonmagical counterparts, while others are conspicuously magical. Handling a magic item is enough to give you a sense that it is extraordinary, but learning a magic item's properties isn't automatic.

The [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/identify-xphb|Identify]] spell is the fastest way to reveal an item's properties. Alternatively, you can focus on one magic item during a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb|Short Rest]] while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, you learn its properties and how to use them (but not any curse the item might bear).

Sometimes a magic item carries a clue to its properties. The command word to activate a ring might be etched inside the band, or a feathered design might hint that it's a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/ring-of-feather-falling-xdmg|Ring of Feather Falling]].

Wearing or experimenting with an item can also offer hints about its properties. In the specific case of Potions, a little taste is enough to tell the taster what a potion does. Other items might require more experimentation. For example, if your character puts on a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/ring-of-swimming-xdmg|Ring of Swimming]], the DM might say, "Your movement feels strangely fluid." Perhaps you then dive into a river to see what happens. The DM would then say you swim unexpectedly well.

### Attunement

Some magic items require a creature to form a bond—called Attunement—with them before the creature can use an item's magical properties. Without becoming attuned to an item that requires Attunement, you gain only its nonmagical benefits unless its description states otherwise. For example, a magic Shield that requires Attunement provides the benefits of a normal Shield if you aren't attuned to it, but none of its magical properties.

#### Attune during a Short Rest

Attuning to an item requires you to spend a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb|Short Rest]] focused on only that item while being in physical contact with it (this can't be the same Short Rest used to learn the item's properties). This focus can take the form of weapon practice (for a Weapon), meditation (for a Wand), or some other appropriate activity. If the Short Rest is interrupted, the Attunement attempt fails. Otherwise, at the end of the Short Rest, you're attuned to the magic item and can access its full magical capabilities.

#### No More Than Three Items

You can be attuned to no more than three magic items at a time. Any attempt to attune to a fourth item fails; you must end your Attunement to an item first. Additionally, you can't attune to more than one copy of an item. For example, you can't attune to more than one [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/ring-of-protection-xdmg|Ring of Protection]] at a time.

#### Ending Attunement

Your Attunement to an item ends if you no longer satisfy the prerequisites for Attunement, if the item has been more than 100 feet away for at least 24 hours, if you die, or if another creature attunes to the item. You can also voluntarily end Attunement by spending another [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb|Short Rest]] focused on the item unless the item is cursed.

### Wearing and Wielding Items

Using a magic item's properties might mean wearing or wielding it. A magic item meant to be worn must be donned in the intended fashion: boots go on feet, gloves on hands, hats and helmets on a head, and rings on a finger. Magic armor must be donned, a Shield strapped to the arm, a cloak fastened about the shoulders. A weapon must be held.

In most cases, a magic item that's meant to be worn can fit a creature regardless of size or build. Magic garments are made to be easily adjustable, or they magically adjust themselves to the wearer.

#### Multiple Items of the Same Kind

You can't wear more than one of certain magic items. You can't normally wear more than one pair of footwear, one pair of gloves or gauntlets, one pair of bracers, one suit of armor, one item of headwear, or one cloak. The DM might make exceptions.

#### Paired Items

Items that come in pairs—such as boots, bracers, gauntlets, and gloves—impart their benefits only if both items of the pair are worn. For example, a character wearing a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/boots-of-striding-and-springing-xdmg|Boot of Striding and Springing]] on one foot and a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/boots-of-elvenkind-xdmg|Boot of Elvenkind]] on the other foot gains no benefit from either.

## Crafting Equipment

Using the rules below, characters can make nonmagical items, [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing-xdmg|Potions of Healing]], and [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll-xdmg|Spell Scrolls]].

### Crafting Nonmagical Items

To craft a nonmagical item, you need tools, raw materials, and time, each of which is detailed below. If you meet the requirements, you make the item, and you can use it or sell it at its normal price.

#### Tools

This chapter's ""Tools"" section lists which tools are required to make certain items. The DM assigns required tools for items not listed there.

You must use the required tool to make an item and have proficiency with that tool. Anyone who helps you must also have proficiency with it.

#### Raw Materials

To make an item, you need raw materials worth half its purchase cost (round down). For example, you need 750 GP of raw materials to make Plate Armor, which sells for 1,500 GP. The DM determines whether appropriate raw materials are available.

#### Time

To determine how many days (working 8 hours a day) it takes to make an item, divide its purchase cost in GP by 10 (round a fraction up to a day). For example, you need 5 days to make a Heavy Crossbow, which sells for 50 GP.

If an item requires multiple days, the days needn't be consecutive.

Characters can combine their efforts to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Normally, only one other character can assist you, but the DM might allow more assistants.

### Brewing Potions of Healing

A character who has proficiency with the Herbalism Kit can create a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/potion-of-healing-xdmg|Potion of Healing]]. Doing so requires using that kit and 25 GP of raw material over the course of 1 day (8 hours of work).

### Scribing Spell Scrolls

A spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll and create a [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/spell-scroll-xdmg|Spell Scroll]], using the rules below.

#### Time and Cost

Scribing a scroll takes an amount of time and money based on the level of the spell, as shown in the "Spell Scroll Costs table". For each day of inscription, you must work for 8 hours. If a scroll requires multiple days, those days needn't be consecutive.

#### Prerequisites for the Scribe

To scribe a scroll, you must have proficiency in the [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/skills#Arcana|Arcana]] skill or with [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/calligraphers-supplies-xphb|Calligrapher's Supplies]] and have the spell prepared on each day of the inscription. You must also have at hand any Material components required by the spell; if the spell consumes its Material components, they are consumed only when you complete the scroll. The scroll's spell uses your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.

#### Cantrips

If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the scroll works as if the caster were your level.
