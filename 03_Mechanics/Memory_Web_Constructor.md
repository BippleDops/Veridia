# Memory Web Constructor

Builds 10,000+ interconnected memory fragments, archaeology, false memories, collective unconscious, viruses, and temporal bleed.

## Memory Fragments
- Nodes with tags (person, place, event, feeling); edges reflect causal and emotional links

## Archaeology
- Investigate, reconstruct, and trade fragments to learn truths

## False Memory Traps
- Mimicry nodes; reveal via anchor rituals or contradiction checks

## Collective Unconscious
- Shared dream zones; navigate with [[Merger Hybrid Vehicles|Dream Barges]]

## Memory Viruses
- Propagate along edges; cause identity drift or mass hysteria
