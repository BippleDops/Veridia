## Description
While wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak its [[Command|command]] word. When you do so, you can see into and through solid matter for 1 minute. This vision has a radius of 30 feet. To you, solid [[11 - Objects|objects]] within that radius appear transparent and donâ€™t prevent [[9 - The Environment|light]] from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.

Whenever you use the ring again before taking a long rest, you must succeed on a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 15 [[Constitution|Constitution]] saving throw or gain one level of [[Exhaustion|exhaustion]].
