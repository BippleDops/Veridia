# Mass Cure Wounds
*5th-level, Abjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of healing energy washes out from a point you can see within range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius [Sphere](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on that point. Each target regains [Hit Points](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) equal to `5d8` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The healing increases by `d8` for each spell slot level above 5.

**Classes**: [Druid](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Sorcerer (Divine Soul)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-divine-soul-xge.md "subclass=XGE;class=XPHB"); [Cleric](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Cleric (Life Domain)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-life-domain-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Druid (Circle of the Moon)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-circle-of-the-moon-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md)
