# Net

## Overview
**Type**: Martial Ranged Weapons

**Era**: Medieval Item

**Price**: 1 gp

**Damage**: â€”

**Weight**: 3 lb.

**Properties**: [[3 - Weapons|Special]], Thrown (range 5/15)

**Net.** A Large or smaller creature hit by a [[3 - Weapons|net]] is [[Restrained|restrained]] until it is freed. A [[3 - Weapons|net]] has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 [[Strength|Strength]] check, freeing itself or another creature within its [[3 - Weapons|reach]] on a success. Dealing 5 [[17 - Damage and Healing|slashing]] damage to the [[3 - Weapons|net]] (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the [[3 - Weapons|net]].



When you use an action, [[12 - The Order of Combat|bonus action]], or [[12 - The Order of Combat|reaction]] to [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] with a [[3 - Weapons|net]], you can make only one [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.
