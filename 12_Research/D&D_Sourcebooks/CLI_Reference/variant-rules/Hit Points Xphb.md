# Hit Points
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 368. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* 

Hit Points (HP) are a measure of how difficult it is to kill or destroy a creature or an object. Damage reduces Hit Points, and healing restores them. You can't have more Hit Points than your Hit Point maximum, and you can't have less than 0.
