# The Sundering

The Sundering was a magical cataclysm that occurred centuries ago, shattering the continent of Aethel into a vast archipelago. The event was caused by a ritualistic experiment by the ruling magocracy, who sought to ascend to godhood by drawing upon the raw magical energies of the planet. The ritual failed catastrophically, unleashing a wave of uncontrolled magic that tore the land apart.

The aftermath of the Sundering was a period of chaos and despair. The survivors were scattered across the newly formed islands, their civilization in ruins. Much of the knowledge and magic of the old world was lost, and the once-great cities of Aethel were either destroyed or submerged beneath the waves.

In the centuries since, the people of the Shattered Isles have slowly rebuilt their world. New civilizations have emerged, each with its own unique culture and traditions. The seas are now the lifeblood of Aethel, with trade and travel connecting the scattered islands. Yet, the legacy of the Sundering remains. The ruins of the old world are still scattered across the archipelago, filled with lost treasures and dangerous magic. And in the depths of the sea, the sunken cities of the magocracy lie waiting to be rediscovered.
