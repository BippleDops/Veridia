## Description
A well hung pack can make the difference between stamina and fatigue. Our equipment frame (10 gp) is a light (5 lb) steel [[Harness|harness]] that centers weight upon the hips rather than the shoulders. Bristling with one-way hooks, the frame can be loaded with [[Rucksack|rucksack]], waterskins, weaponry, map scrolls, and all manner of equipment in easy reach. For an added 3 sp, we supply a canvas fly that drapes over the frame, protecting equipment and body alike from even torrential rains.
