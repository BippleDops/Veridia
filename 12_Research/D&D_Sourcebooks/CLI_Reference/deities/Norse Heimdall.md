Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of norse heimdall as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around norse heimdall. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology.
