# Shadow Corruption

A mysterious phenomenon affecting both organic and inorganic matter in certain regions of Aquabyssos, where shadows gain independence from their sources and begin to influence reality directly.

## Overview

Shadow Corruption manifests as an autonomous separation of shadows from their casting objects, creating independent shadow entities that can act against their sources. This phenomenon appears to be linked to the deep pressures of Aquabyssos and certain reality-manipulation experiments.

## Manifestations

### Stage 1: Shadow Independence
- Shadows move seconds after their source
- Temperature drops near affected shadows
- Whispered conversations in unknown languages

### Stage 2: Active Opposition
- Shadows actively work against their sources
- Physical resistance to normal movement
- Memory gaps during shadow-active periods

### Stage 3: Reality Replacement
- Shadows begin replacing their sources
- Consciousness overlap between source and shadow
- Progressive identity dissolution

## Connection to Shadow Surgery

The Shadow Surgeons have learned to harness and direct Shadow Corruption for their consciousness manipulation experiments, using controlled corruption to separate and transfer awareness between entities.
