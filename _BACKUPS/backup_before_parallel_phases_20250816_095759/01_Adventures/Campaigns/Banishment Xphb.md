--- # Banishment

*4th-level, Abjuration* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pentacle)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute One creature that you can see within range must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be transported to a harmless demiplane for the duration. While there, the target has the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated condition. When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. If the target is an Aberration, a Celestial, an Elemental, a Fey, or a Fiend, the target doesn't return if the spell lasts for 1 minute. The target is instead transported to a random location on a plane (DM's choice) associated with its creature type. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4. **Classes**: [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]]; [[05_Rules/Character Classes; [05_Rules/Character Classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 245.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of banishment xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around banishment xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Covenant - Control trade routes ## Plot Hooks - A merchant needs help investigating before dawn
