# Ancient Aquabyssos Rulers
*Chronicles of the Drowned Dynasties*

## Overview

Before the establishment of the [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Parliament of Echoes, [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] was ruled by a series of monarchs whose reigns spanned from the pre-drowning era through the tumultuous centuries following [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Drowning|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Drowning. These rulers, known collectively as the Drowned Dynasties, shaped the underwater civilization through periods of survival, adaptation, expansion, and eventually, the transition to democratic governance.

The records of these ancient rulers are fragmented, preserved in [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Memory Meadows Black Market]], coral-carved monuments, and the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Abyssal Academy archives. Many details have been lost to time, aboleth manipulation, and the chaos of the early drowning years.

## The Pre-Drowning Dynasty (Lost Era)

### Emperor Nereon the Tidecaller (Dates Lost)
*"The Last Surface Emperor"*
- Ruled the coastal kingdom that would become Aquabyssos

- **The Tidecaller's Trident**: Ancient weapon with power over water (possibly the [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Tide Turner's Trident)

### The Lost Princes
References exist to Emperor Nereon's children, but their names and fates remain mysteries.

[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Aquabyssos Ambassadors]] still use ceremonial elements derived from Empress Marina's diplomatic innovations.

## Scholarly Debates

### The Nereon Question
Did the first emperor truly control storms, or were these exaggerated accounts of advanced weather magic?

Emperor Hadal's disappearance and connections to aboleths remain contentious subjects among historians.

How voluntary was Emperor Benthicus's abdication, and did external pressures influence the shift to democracy?
