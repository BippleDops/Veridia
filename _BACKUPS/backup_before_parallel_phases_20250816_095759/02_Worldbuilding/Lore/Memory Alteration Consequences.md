- Resolving memory problems might be necessary for controlling shadow corruption

### The Ultimate Consequence

> [!warning] DM Only
> The widespread memory alteration is not just a social problem—it's weakening the barrier between [[Aethermoor and [Aquabyssos]]. Each altered memory creates a small "reality wound" that allows dimensional bleeding. The memory alteration epidemic is actually accelerating [[The Convergence Point and making it more chaotic.

### The [Deep Mother]]'s Influence

> [!warning] DM Secret
> [[The Deep Mother]] has been subtly influencing the development of memory alteration technology through dreams. She wants the population to become comfortable with altered consciousness as preparation for merger into collective awareness. The memory alteration consequences are part of her awakening process.

### The True Cure

> [!warning] Hidden Knowledge
> The only way to fully resolve memory alteration consequences is to restore the original unified reality before the dimensional split. This is why [[The Real Marina's integration is so important—she holds the key to healing not just individual memories, but the fundamental nature of memory itself.

### Late Campaign

- Choose how to resolve memory problems in context of convergence
- Deal with society-threatening memory cascade event
- Use understanding of memory consequences to guide convergence outcome
- Confront entities responsible for memory alteration epidemic
- Make final decisions about role of memory in merged reality
