# Sphere of Adaptation (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *7th-level*

**School**: *abjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch (20-foot radius)

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 24 hours


## Effects
A glistening, transparent globe forms around one creature you touch and moves with that creature. Other creatures may re-main within the sphere as well if they stay close to the target.

The globe contains a self-renewing supply of air and allows no inanimate objects in (it does not prevent undead or constructs from entering). Creatures within the sphere are immune to gasses and respiratory attacks and can breathe underwater or even in a vacuum.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell with a 8th-level or higher spell slot, the duration increases to 1 week.
