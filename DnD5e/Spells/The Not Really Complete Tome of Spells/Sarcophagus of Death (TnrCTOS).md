# Sarcophagus of Death (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *5th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a fragment of a sar-cophagus)

**Duration**: 10 minutes


## Effects
A coffin-shaped rectangle of force forms around one target you can see within range. That target must make a Dexterity saving throw to avoid being trapped inside.

The sarcophagus is completely airtight and cannot be broken from the inside. On the outside, it is a physical object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.
