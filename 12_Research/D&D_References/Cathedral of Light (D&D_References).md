> [!tip] DM Note
> The Cathedral serves as a moral anchor and safe haven in campaigns, providing healing, information, and sanctuary for characters. Use it to introduce religious themes, moral dilemmas, and opportunities for characters to help others. The mysteries and secrets provide ongoing plot threads, while the daily operations offer realistic downtime activities.

## Player-Facing Summary

Cathedral of Light is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Cathedral of Light as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Cathedral of Light.
