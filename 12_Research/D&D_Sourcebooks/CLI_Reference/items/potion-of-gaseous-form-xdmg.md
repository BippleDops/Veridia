# Potion of Gaseous Form
*Potion, rare*  

- **Weight**: 0.5 lbs.

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the [[gaseous-form-xphb|Gaseous Form]] spell for 1 hour (no [[conditions#Concentration|Concentration]] required) or until you end the effect as a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]].

This potion's container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.
