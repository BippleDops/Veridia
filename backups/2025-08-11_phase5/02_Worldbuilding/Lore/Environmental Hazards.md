# Environmental Hazards
*Dangers of the Merged Realms*

> *"The depths and heights both hold terrors that can crush body and soul. A wise adventurer learns to read the signs—the shimmer that warns of pressure shears, the crystal resonance that precedes reality tears. Nature itself has become weaponized in these merged realms."*
> — [[Master Explorer Tide Stormwright]], Environmental Hazards Specialist

## Overview

Environmental Hazards encompass the myriad natural and supernatural dangers that threaten adventurers in the merged realms of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]. These hazards go beyond simple weather or terrain challenges to include reality distortions, pressure anomalies, magical contamination, and the unstable effects of two worlds attempting to occupy the same space.

Unlike traditional environmental dangers, the hazards in this campaign setting often interact with each other in complex ways. Pressure differentials can trigger magical resonances, crystal corruption can amplify temporal distortions, and shadow wells can create cascading failures across multiple environmental systems. Understanding these interactions is crucial for survival.

The environmental hazards serve multiple mechanical purposes: they create tactical challenges during exploration and combat, provide atmospheric tension for roleplay scenarios, offer consequences for poor planning or reckless behavior, and demonstrate the alien nature of the merged reality. Each hazard includes specific mechanics, detection methods, protection strategies, and recovery procedures.

Recent convergence events have created entirely new categories of environmental threats as the physics and magic of both realms clash and combine in unpredictable ways. Some hazards that were once confined to specific depths or altitudes now appear randomly throughout the merged zones, requiring constant vigilance from travelers.
