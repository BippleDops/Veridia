# Far Gear
**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items

**Rarity:** very rare

**Attunement**: *requires attunement*

## Description

While attuned to this device, you have a +1 bonus to Charisma saving throws, and you have advantage on Charisma ([[Intimidation]]) checks.

**Aberrant Ally** You can conjure an aberrant creature from the chaos of the multiverse to serve you. This functions as the [[conjure celestial]] spell (no concentration required), except the creature you summon is an aberration of challenge rating 4 or lower. Once you use this feature of the far gear, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

**Unnatural Bane** You can cast the [[bane]]  spell (save DC 15), which affects any number of creatures within range for 1 minute. Once you use this feature of the far gear, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

**Part of a Whole** While this component is not installed in the [[Orrery of the Wanderer]], its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.
