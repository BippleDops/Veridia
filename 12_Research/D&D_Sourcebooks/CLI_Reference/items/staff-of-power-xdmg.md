- **Damage**:
  - One-handed: 1d6 bludgeoning
  - Two-handed: 1d8 bludgeoning
- **Properties**: [[item-properties#Versatile|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 4.0 lbs.

This staff has 20 charges and can be wielded as a magic Quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to [[armor-class-xphb|Armor Class]], saving throws, and spell attack rolls.

## Spells

| Spell | Charge Cost |
|-------|-------------|
| [[cone-of-cold-xphb|Cone of Cold]] | 5 |

## Regaining Charges

The staff regains `2d8 + 4` expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll `d20`. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regains `1d8 + 2` charges.

## Retributive Strike

You can take a [[actions#Magic|Magic]] action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its magic in an explosion that fills a 30-foot [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] originating from itself. You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take Force damage equal to 16 times the number of charges in the staff . Each other creature in the area makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes Force damage equal to 4 times the number of charges in the staff . On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.
