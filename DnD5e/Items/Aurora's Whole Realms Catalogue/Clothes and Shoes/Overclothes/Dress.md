## Description
Dresses and gowns are almost universally praised by admiring men for “complementing the fairer figures” and providing women “a healthy circulation of air.” In turn, they are almost universally cursed by women for “making us immobile” and “letting our knees freeze off.” Though most adventuring women have donned garb suitable for such actions, dresses and gowns still remain popular among homebound folk. 

We offer a common laborwoman’s dress made of durable and comfortable linen and available in gnome (7 cp), halfling (8 cp), elf (1 sp), and human (2 sp) sizes. The central drawstring makes the dress fit all girths. White, beige, gray, brown, and black cost nothing extra, and any dyeing costs 2 sp. 

Our gown is a simple dress of silk that can be later adorned by lace and ruffles. The dress comes in gnome (5 gp), halfling (7 gp), elf (10 gp), and human (15 gp) sizes in red, blue, green, black, brown, and white. Please specify ecto-, meso-, or endomorphic.
