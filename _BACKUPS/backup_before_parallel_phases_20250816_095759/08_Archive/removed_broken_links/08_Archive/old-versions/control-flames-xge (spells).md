--- # Control Flames

*cantrip, Transmutation* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/control-flames.webp#right) - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous, up to 1 hour You choose nonmagical flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You affect it in one of the following ways: - You instantaneously expand the flame 5 feet in one direction, provided that wood or other fuel is present in the new location. - You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube. - You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour. - You cause simple shapesâ€”such as the vague form of a creature, an iimate object, or a locationâ€”to appear within the flames and animate as you like. The shapes last for 1 hour. If you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three non-instantaneous effects created by it active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as an action. **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]]; [[classes *Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 152* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Control flames xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
