# Kraken

## Lair actions
_Source: Monster Manual_

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the kraken takes a lair action to cause one of the following magical effects:

- A strong current moves through the kraken's lair. Each creature within 60 feet of the kraken must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 60 feet away from the kraken. On a success, the creature is pushed 10 feet away from the kraken.  
- Creatures in the water within 60 feet of the kraken have vulnerability to lightning damage until initiative count 20 on the next round.  
- The water in the kraken's lair becomes electrically charged. All creatures within 120 feet of the kraken must succeed on a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (`3d6`) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual_

The region containing a kraken's lair is warped by the creature's blasphemous presence, creating the following magical effects:

- The kraken can alter the weather at will in a 6-mile radius centered on its lair. The effect is identical to the [[control-weather-xphb|control weather]] spell.  
- Water elementals coalesce within 6 miles of the lair. These elementals can't leave the water and have Intelligence and Charisma scores of 1 (-5).  
- Aquatic creatures within 6 miles of the lair that have an Intelligence score of 2 or lower are [[conditions#Charmed|charmed]] by the kraken and aggressive toward intruders in the area.  

When the kraken dies, all of these regional effects fade immediately.

## Player-Facing Summary

Kraken is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of kraken as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around kraken.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties kraken to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at kraken to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to kraken active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
