# Detect Charm (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *divination*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (the crushed petals of a bleeding-heart flower)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 10 minutes


## Effects
You look into the eyes of a target and can see if that creature is under a magical charm or under any similar spell (a spell that does not function if the target is immune to charm, such as *suggestion*). This spell does not reveal what sort of charm the target is under or who placed the charm on that per-son. You can examine one person per round.
