--- # Adamantine Weapons

*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 78* Adamantine is an ultrahard metal found in meteorites and extraordinary mineral veins. In addition to being used to craft [[Adamantine Armor Xdmg]], the metal is also used for weapons. Melee weapons and ammunition made of or coated with adamantine are unusually effective when used to break objects. Whenever an [[adamantine-weapon-xdmg (items)]] or piece of [[Adamantine Ammunition Xge]] hits an object, the hit is a critical hit. The adamantine version of a melee weapon or of ten pieces of ammunition costs 500 gp more than the normal version, whether the weapon or ammunition is made of the metal or coated with it. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Adamantine weapons xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
