# Passive Perception
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 372. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* 

Passive Perception is a score that reflects a creature's general awareness of its surroundings. The DM uses this score when determining whether a creature notices something without consciously making a Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) check.

A creature's Passive Perception equals 10 plus the creature's Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) check bonus. If the creature has [[advantage xphb|Advantage]] on such checks, increase the score by 5. If the creature has [[disadvantage xphb|Disadvantage]] on them, decrease the score by 5. For example, a level 1 character with a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception has a Passive Perception of 14 (`10 + 2 + 2`). If that character has [[advantage xphb|Advantage]] on Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) checks, the score becomes 19 (`10 + 2 + 2 + 5`).
