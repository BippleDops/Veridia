Archon Meredith Saltweaver rules [[New Tethys|02 Worldbuilding/Places/New Tethys and the [Tethyan Hegemony]] with an iron fist wrapped in silk. A master politician and powerful hydromancer, she maintains her position through careful manipulation, strategic alliances, and rumored dark pacts. She appears as a regal woman in her 50s, though magic keeps her looking younger. Her skin has a blue-green tint from partial adaptation, and her eyes glow with an unsettling cerulean light. ## History

Born to merchant family before the drowning's completion, Meredith witnessed the final transformations of the surface world. She maneuvered through the chaos to seize power, supposedly making a deal with something in [[The Cerulean Trench|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Cerulean Trench for the strength to rule. Has ruled New Tethys for 47 years. ## Current Activities

1. Implementing new taxation on depth travelers
2. Secretly building shelters for "The Emergence"
3. Investigating the [Crown Dome Conspiracy]]
4. Negotiating with [[The Bathyal Palace|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Bathyal Palace]] for greater authority
5. Experiencing increasingly vivid dreams of the depths ## Secrets
