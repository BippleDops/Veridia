# Harbor Master Nautilus Tideguard
*The Incorruptible Anchor of Port Meridian*

> [!info] Quick Reference
> **Race**: Triton
> **Class**: Fighter (Battle Master) 8 / Ranger (Horizon Walker) 4
> **Alignment**: Lawful Neutral
> **CR**: 12
> **Role**: Port authority, former naval commander, corruption investigator

## Appearance

Nautilus Tideguard cuts an imposing figure even by triton standards, standing seven feet tall with the muscular build of someone who spent decades wrestling with deep-sea currents. His scales have dulled from vibrant blue-green to a weathered gray-green, each one bearing tiny scars from countless underwater battles. His left arm is a masterwork of bioengineering—a prosthetic made from cultivated coral and enchanted bronze that responds to his thoughts with hydraulic precision.

His face tells the story of his life: a prominent scar runs from his right temple to his jaw (a gift from a sahuagin raid), his eyes are the pale blue of deep ice (a side effect of prolonged exposure to abyssal pressures), and his expression rarely shifts from stern concentration. He wears his Harbor Master uniform with military precision—every button polished, every crease sharp enough to cut kelp.

The most distinctive feature is his "Crown of Office"—a living coral headdress that grows from his skull, its branches extending like antlers. The coral glows different colors based on his emotional state, though it rarely shifts from the steady blue of controlled authority. When he's truly angry, it flares red, and every dock worker in Port Meridian knows to find somewhere else to be.

## Personality

Nautilus embodies the phrase "still waters run deep." He speaks rarely, but when he does, his voice carries the weight of absolute authority. He has memorized every regulation, every protocol, and every legal precedent relating to maritime law in both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. He quotes regulation numbers like others quote poetry.

**Key Personality Traits:**
- **Methodical**: Plans everything three moves ahead, keeps detailed logs of every ship movement
- **Incorruptible**: Has turned down bribes that would make him rich enough to buy his own city
- **Protective**: Views Port Meridian's safety as a personal responsibility
- **Haunted**: Still has nightmares about the Battle of the Bleeding Depths
- **Lonely**: His dedication to duty has cost him family and friends

**Mannerisms:**
- Taps his prosthetic fingers in a specific rhythm when thinking (old naval communication code)
- Never sits with his back to a door or window
- Tests the pressure of any room he enters by cracking his neck
- Refers to people by their job titles rather than names
- Keeps exactly three feet of distance from others when speaking

**Voice:**
Deep and resonant, like distant thunder underwater. He speaks in clipped, military sentences, often dropping unnecessary words. Never uses contractions. Often phrases orders as questions that aren't really questions: "The manifest will be ready in one hour?"

## Backstory

Born into the prestigious Tideguard military family, Nautilus was destined for naval service from birth. His early years were spent in the Naval Academy of the Depths, where he graduated top of his class in both tactical studies and deep-sea survival. He rose quickly through the ranks, earning commendation after commendation for his strategic brilliance and unwavering courage.

Everything changed during the Battle of the Bleeding Depths, fifteen years ago. As Captain of the warship *Pressure's Promise*, he led the defense against an aboleth incursion from the deepest trenches. The battle was won, but at a terrible cost—half his crew was lost, including his younger sister, First Mate Coral Tideguard. The aboleth's psychic scream shattered his left arm beyond healing and left him with a permanent resistance to mind-affecting magic... and an equally permanent sense of guilt.

He accepted the Harbor Master position as a form of self-imposed exile, believing he no longer deserved a combat command. However, he transformed Port Meridian's chaotic docks into the most efficiently run port in all Aquabyssos. His military precision and strategic mind turned what many saw as a bureaucratic punishment into the foundation of Aquabyssos's economic strength.

In recent months, he's noticed disturbing patterns in shipping manifests and personnel changes. His military instincts scream that something is wrong—too many synchronicities, too many coincidences. He suspects the Shadow Conspiracy has infiltrated his port but trusts no one enough to share his concerns. He's been conducting his own investigation, using his perfect memory for details to track anomalies.

## Roleplay Guidelines

### First Impressions
"Your documentation. Now." *Doesn't look up from his ledger* "Incomplete. Section seven, subsection three. Cargo manifest missing weight specifications. You will correct this. The fee for amended documentation is seventy gold pieces."

### When Suspicious
*Taps prosthetic fingers in that rhythm* "Interesting. Your story has three inconsistencies with your filed travel plan. Explain."

### When Angry
*Crown coral flares red* "You dare bring contraband into MY port? You insult the memory of every sailor who died keeping these waters safe. Guards. Impound everything. Including them."

### When Trusting (Rare)
"The Battle of the Bleeding Depths. Perhaps you have heard of it. No? Good. Some stories should stay drowned. But know this—something worse than aboleths swims in our waters now. Something that wears familiar faces."

### Combat Dialogue
- **Opening**: "Port Authority. Stand down or be put down."
- **Bloodied**: "I held the Bleeding Depths. You are nothing."
- **Victory**: "File your complaint with the depths."
- **Defeat**: "Coral... sister... I'm sorry..."
