# Lightning Shield (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a small bit of marble)

**Duration**: 10 minutes


## Effects
Crackling electrical sparks wreathes your body for the duration, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.

The sparks provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The chill shield grants you resistance to lightning damage, and the warm shield grants you resistance to acid damage.

In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield erupts with electricity. The attacker takes 2d8 acid damage from a warm shield, or 2d8 lightning damage from a cold shield.
