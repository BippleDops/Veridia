# Trap #33 - "A Thousand And One Ways To Use Killer Bees!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> This trap is a genuine work of art. I won't even let Grirntina come into this room for obvious reasons. It is grim and foreboding in its potential, and beautiful in its execution. The open door brings the party face to face with a horse drawn chariot at full charge.
> 
> The wild eyed stallions are literally about to lunge through the open portal upon the unsuspecting party. The delvers torch light will flash brightly in the glaring eyes and caress the contours of the flaring nostrils. This apparition should cause even the most hardened delver to jump back.
> 
> After a momentary pause the party will find that they are confrontednol by a warrior's ghost reaching across the span of time since the tomb was closed but a remarkably life like reproduction of a battle chariot. As the party looks into the room they will find it is filled with a veritable army of statues. In paraded ranks on either side of the chariot can be seen, glinting in the light of the torch, ranks of deamonic looking soldiers. They are clad in blue enameled armor, and holding 6 foot long spears. At their belts are short swords, and on their heads are bizarre flared helmets that partially obscure the hideous faces.
> 
> Behind the first chariot there is another. Further back in the room on a raised dais at the rear can be found a coffin. It is covered with a blue enamel looking almost as if it were a solid block of blue sea water captured while in churning motion.
> 
> The warriors are all slighlly over six feet in height. They also can be fell to radiate magic. The spell is of a very low nature, almost a simple maintenance spell. Upon the party's intrusion into the chamber in any fashion the spell will dissipate. (At this ti.me please note the operative word intrusion. This means any form of entrance into the room. If, for example, Â·the party looses a crossbow into the room intrusion will have taken place.) When the magic dissipates there is no noticeable affect. (Most delvers hate the line, "No NOTICEABLE effect." they are sure there is some UNnoticed affect that they have missed.)
> 
> There is very little room in the chamber to move about. The statue-soldiers are packed in with only inches separating them. A close tactile investigation of the arrayed force will reveal them to be fired terra cotta. They are a brightly painted porcelain army, each one, his weapons and armor, of a single piece.
> 
> Now I, for one, see the party reacting in much the same way that it did when confronted with the crystal warriors earlier; that being to start smashing the statuary. This is the natural tendency of a gang of delvers when confronted with any extremely valuable, but vaguely threatening object. If they do follow this course they will find the statues easy to upset. In fact they are balanced in'such a manner that it is almost impossible not to tip one into the next, like giant dominoes. The resulting serial crashing should momentarilly warm the cockles of the delvers tiny vandalistic hearts. Then will come the time to pay the piper, or in this case the beekeeper.
> 
> If the tomb robbers are still possessed of one or two thinking individuals, or are operating on a greed based system of looting, the value of these statues will be immediately obvious. Each one is an artistic masterpiece from an era gone these thousands of years. If they could be transported intact to a major city they would have a market value as high as 3,000 g.p. each. This would diminish if they were dumped on the market all at once but even massed as a haul they wouJd bring 875 g.p. each. The chariots wouJd be worth three times that.
> 
> A party thinking like this will take great care not to break the statues. It is for their benefit that the area is so closely packed, and the warriors so carefully balanced. Even with due care, for a fully armed and equipped party to be able to cross this room to the dais will require the utmost dexterity and agility. Notwithstanding their best effons there is still a 20% chance (L2) of accidentally setting off a smashing chain reaction.
> 
> The magic spell that dissipated at the party's intrusion into the chamber was one that held in a form of magical stasis the occupants of the statues. Contained within each statue is a small swarm of so-called Killer Bees. (Don't you just love that name, so evocative!) When the chain reaction toppling begins, the bees will swarm, irritated by the crashing falls that release them. To be sure a few wi11 be done in by the crashing of the statue containers, but rest assure there are more than enough survivors to go around.
> 
> The swanning bees are not dangerous as single individuals. (Although there is always the pleasant possibility some delver is alergic, about l % chance!) It is in a swarm, or in this case groups of swanns, that they are lethal. Even armored tomb crashers are affected. Any exposed patch of skin that can be reached by a creature smaller than 1/2 an inch in size will be attacked.
> 
> Oh yea, there are ways to take care of these critters: poison gas, high grade commercial bug bombs, a really large, fast anteater ... but they are tough. Most parties won't survive to reach the coffin. (Now you see why this room is off limits to Grirntina, with her dexterity it is not a matter of if, but when. I'm not that worried about her well being. It's the thought of sitting up nights with a pot of super-glue trying to reset this baby ... )
> 
> This trap is beautiful to look at, but rates only two skulls. The bees will chase the delvers off. Chances of death are slim.
