## Overview

The Crystal Plague crisis has created a thriving underground economy built on desperation, hope, and exploitation. Where legitimate medicine fails, black market traders offer alternatives - some genuine, most fraudulent, all dangerous. This shadow economy operates parallel to official treatment systems, serving those who cannot afford legal care or who have lost faith in conventional medicine.

#### Tier 1: The Cure Peddlers (Street Level)
**Operators:** Small-time criminals, desperate citizens, con artists  
**Products:** Fake cures, contaminated samples, stolen medical supplies  
**Prices:** 5-50 gold pieces  
**Risk Level:** High (poor quality, frequent law enforcement raids)

*Typical Customer:* Working-class families who cannot afford legitimate treatment

#### Tier 2: The Corruption Brokers (Mid-Level)
**Operators:** Organized criminal syndicates, corrupt officials, rogue researchers  
**Products:** Experimental treatments, stolen research data, quality medical equipment  
**Prices:** 100-1,000 gold pieces  
**Risk Level:** Moderate (better quality control, professional security)

*Typical Customer:* Wealthy merchants, minor nobles, government officials

#### Tier 3: The Shadow Consortium (Elite Level)
**Operators:** International crime organizations, foreign intelligence, corrupt nobility  
**Products:** Genuine experimental cures, advanced magical treatments, complete identity changes  
**Prices:** 5,000+ gold pieces  
**Risk Level:** Low (high-quality products, political protection)

*Typical Customer:* Major nobles, wealthy merchants, foreign dignitaries

#### The Harbor Circuit
**Route:** Port Meridian docks â†’ Warehouse District â†’ Noble Quarter  
**Products:** Smuggled medical supplies, stolen research specimens  
**Key Players:** Dockworker syndicates, corrupt customs officials  
**Security:** Port authority bribes, regular patrol schedules known

*Notable Operation:* The "Mercy Ship" - converted fishing vessel that provides mobile medical services using stolen equipment. Authorities have raided it seven times, but it keeps returning under different names.

#### The Underground Railroad  
**Route:** [[Crystal Plague Wards]] â†’ Abandoned mine tunnels â†’ Hidden laboratories  
**Products:** Patient samples, medical intelligence, researcher bribes  
**Key Players:** Corrupt medical staff, [[Medical Research Facilities|rogue scientists]]  
**Security:** Hospital insider information, magical concealment

*Security Breach:* Three head nurses were arrested last month for selling patient specimens to black market researchers. Hospital security protocols have been completely overhauled.

#### The Diplomatic Channel
**Route:** Foreign embassies â†’ Private estates â†’ International networks  
**Products:** Advanced foreign treatments, experimental procedures, exile services  
**Key Players:** Diplomatic staff, international crime syndicates  
**Security:** Diplomatic immunity, high-level political connections

*Current Investigation:* The Royal Intelligence Service suspects the Aethermoor embassy of running treatments in exchange for state secrets, but diplomatic immunity prevents direct investigation.

### The Merchant Prince - Lord Aldric Goldcurrent

**Age:** 47  
**Background:** Legitimate shipping magnate turned black market kingpin  
**Motivation:** Daughter contracted Stage 3 plague; legal treatment failed  
**Resources:** Fleet of merchant vessels, network of corrupt officials  
**Territory:** Controls 60% of harbor-based smuggling operations

Lord Goldcurrent maintains a facade of legitimate business while operating the most sophisticated medical smuggling network in Port Meridian. His public persona as a grieving father seeking help for his daughter provides perfect cover for criminal operations.

*Current Operations:*
- Imports experimental treatments from foreign nations
- Maintains private medical facility for elite clients
- Bribes customs officials to ignore "medical supply" shipments
- Funds [[Medical Research Facilities|underground research]] through shell companies

*Personal Code:* Never sells completely fake cures - his products are either genuine or clearly labeled as experimental. This reputation for "honest dishonesty" has made him the most trusted name in black market medicine.

#### The Golden Harbor Warehouse

**Location:** Pier 12, heavily guarded compound  
**Cover Story:** Legitimate medical supply importation  
**Security:** 20 armed guards, magical detection wards, escape tunnels  
**Inventory:** Current stock worth approximately 50,000 gold pieces

*Ground Floor:* Legitimate medical supplies provide cover for inspections  
*Basement Level 1:* High-value contraband and experimental treatments  
*Basement Level 2:* Private medical facility with three treatment rooms  
*Hidden Sub-Level:* Emergency escape route connects to harbor tunnel system

### The Alchemist - Dr. Marcus Shadowmend

**Age:** 39  
**Background:** Former Royal Academy researcher, expelled for unethical experiments  
**Specialization:** Chemical and magical plague treatments  
**Base of Operations:** Mobile laboratory hidden in converted sewage treatment facility  
**Client Base:** Mid-tier customers seeking experimental cures

Dr. Shadowmend was expelled from the [[Medical Research Facilities|Royal Academy]] for conducting unauthorized human experimentation. Rather than abandon his research, he took it underground, developing treatments that official medicine considers too dangerous to attempt.

*Signature Products:*
- **Crystal Dissolvent:** Chemical compound that breaks down Stage 1-2 formations (30% success rate, 15% fatality rate)
- **Transformation Accelerator:** Speeds up plague progression to Stage 5 for terminally ill patients who prefer quick transcendence
- **Symbiosis Serum:** Experimental treatment that attempts to preserve consciousness during crystallization

*Client Testimonial - Anonymous Stage 3 Patient:*
"Dr. Shadowmend's treatment hurt like being torn apart and rebuilt, but the crystals stopped growing. The official doctors said I had weeks to live. That was six months ago."

#### The Underground Laboratory Complex

**Location:** Abandoned mine shaft, three levels below street  
**Security:** Magical concealment, trapped access points, loyal guards  
**Equipment:** Stolen and improvised research apparatus worth 25,000 gold pieces  
**Capacity:** Can treat 8 patients simultaneously

*Level 1:* Reception area disguised as natural cave formation  
*Level 2:* Main laboratory with chemical synthesis equipment  
*Level 3:* Patient treatment rooms and recovery areas  
*Hidden Level:* Personal quarters and emergency supply storage

### The Information Broker - Whisper Goldtongue

**Age:** Unknown (appears mid-30s)  
**Background:** Possibly former intelligence operative  
**Specialization:** Medical intelligence, research data, patient information  
**Network:** Contacts in every major medical facility and research institution  
**Operating Style:** Never meets clients directly, all communication through intermediaries

Whisper Goldtongue doesn't sell treatments - she sells information. Her network of contacts provides intelligence about new research developments, patient conditions, and institutional vulnerabilities that other black market operators need to function.

*Information Products:*
- **Research Previews:** Advanced warning of research breakthroughs before official publication
- **Patient Profiles:** Detailed medical histories of high-value clients
- **Security Intelligence:** Guard schedules, weak points in institutional security
- **Competitive Analysis:** Information about rival black market operations

*Recent Intelligence Sale:* Sold complete patient records from [[Crystal Plague Wards]] to three different buyers, including [[Crystal Cult Temples|crystal cult]] recruiters and foreign research delegations. The security breach forced hospitals to completely redesign their record-keeping systems.

#### The Information Network

**Communication System:** Coded messages through legitimate business channels  
**Security:** Dead drops, coded language, multiple identity covers  
**Sources:** 47 active informants in medical and research institutions  
**Archives:** Complete intelligence files on 500+ individuals involved in plague response

*Network Security Measures:*
- All informants know only their immediate handler
- Information compartmentalized to prevent complete network exposure
- Regular security sweeps to detect counter-intelligence operations
- Emergency protocols for informant extraction and network shutdown

#### Imported Treatments
**Source:** Foreign nations with different plague research programs  
**Quality:** Variable, often untested in local conditions  
**Price Range:** 200-2,000 gold pieces  
**Success Rate:** 20-40% depending on product and patient stage

*Popular Import:* Aethermoor crystal resoce disruptors show promising results but require specialized equipment for administration. Black market versions often lack proper calibration.

#### Stolen Medical Equipment
**Source:** Hospital and research facility theft  
**Quality:** Professional grade but often damaged or incomplete  
**Price Range:** 50-500% of retail cost depending on rarity  
**Risk:** Equipment may be recognized and traced back to theft

*High-Demand Item:* Crystal contamination detectors - essential for safe black market operations but extremely expensive through legitimate channels.

#### Experimental Research Data
**Source:** [[Medical Research Facilities|Research institution]] leaks and theft  
**Quality:** Often cutting-edge but unverified  
**Price Range:** 100-5,000 gold pieces for complete research files  
**Application:** Allows independent researchers to replicate official experiments

*Recent Sale:* Complete research files on pressure treatment protocols sold to underground researchers, leading to establishment of three illegal pressure treatment facilities.

#### Snake Oil Cures
**Common Ingredients:** Colored water, mild stimulants, placebo compounds  
**Marketing Claims:** "Ancient remedies," "Natural crystal cleansing," "Divine healing"  
**Price Range:** 5-50 gold pieces  
**Customer Base:** Desperate families with limited resources

*Typical Scam:* "Brother Tidewell's Crystal Cleansing Elixir" - sugar water with blue coloring sold as blessed ocean essence. Dozens of variants appear weekly with different names and stories.

#### Contaminated Samples
**Source:** Incorrectly stored medical supplies, deliberate contamination  
**Risk:** Can accelerate plague progression or cause secondary infections  
**Price:** Sold at discount as "bulk treatment supplies"  
**Detection:** Often only discovered after administration

*Warning Case:* A batch of "purified healing crystals" was actually contaminated with concentrated plague samples. Seven customers progressed to Stage 4 within days of use.

#### Identity Forgery
**Purpose:** Allow plague victims to escape quarantine and assume new identities  
**Quality:** Professional forgeries include medical records and documentation  
**Price Range:** 1,000-5,000 gold pieces for complete identity package  
**Risk:** Discovery results in immediate arrest and mandatory quarantine

*Services Include:*
- False identification documents
- Fake medical clearance certificates  
- Safe house accommodation during identity transition
- Transportation to regions without plague screening

#### Controlled Crystallization
**Theory:** Guide plague progression to preserve consciousness while gaining crystal abilities  
**Developer:** [[Crystal Cult Temples|Crystal cult]] researchers working with black market scientists  
**Success Rate:** Unknown - volunteers rarely return to report results  
**Price:** 10,000+ gold pieces plus participation in ongoing experiments

*Ethical Concerns:* Treatment essentially converts patients into willing cult members. Official medical authorities consider this exploitation of desperate individuals.

#### Divine Intervention Services
**Method:** Bribery or coercion of high-level religious officials  
**Service:** Advanced healing magic normally reserved for nobility  
**Price:** 5,000-20,000 gold pieces plus significant political favors  
**Effectiveness:** Genuine divine magic shows high success rates for Stages 1-3

*Notable Case:* A wealthy merchant paid 15,000 gold pieces to arrange a "chance encounter" with [[Brother Marcus]] during his daughter's Stage 2 crisis. The healing was successful, but the merchant now owes significant favors to criminal organizations.

*Controversial Case:* Lord Goldcurrent's daughter was cured using his black market connections. Public opinion polls show 60% approval for his operations despite their illegal nature.

### The Desperate Family
The party encounters a working-class family whose child has contracted the plague. They cannot afford legitimate treatment and are considering black market alternatives. The family asks the party to investigate a "miracle cure" being sold in the warehouse district.

*Complications:*
- The cure is partially genuine but extremely dangerous
- The seller is actually an undercover law enforcement agent
- A [[Crystal Cult Temples|crystal cult]] is using the family as recruitment targets
- The child's condition is deteriorating rapidly while they investigate

### The Research Theft
Important plague research has been stolen from a [[Medical Research Facilities|major research facility]]. The party must navigate the black market to recover the data before it's sold to foreign interests or used for harmful purposes.

*Investigation Leads:*
- Multiple black market factions are bidding for the research
- The theft was an inside job involving trusted personnel
- Foreign agents are attempting to acquire the data for military purposes
- The research contains information that could revolutionize treatment

### The Corrupt Official
A high-ranking government official is secretly operating a major black market network while publicly supporting harsh enforcement measures. The party must gather evidence without alerting the official's extensive security network.

*Challenges:*
- The official has informants throughout law enforcement
- Evidence is hidden behind layers of legitimate business operations
- Exposing the corruption could destabilize the entire plague response system
- Other officials may be involved in the cover-up

### The Moral Dilemma
The party discovers that a black market operation is selling genuine, effective treatments that save lives - but their methods involve exploiting desperate patients and stealing from legitimate medical facilities.

*Ethical Questions:*
- Is illegal but effective treatment better than legal but inadequate care?
- How much criminal activity is justified to save lives?
- Should the party support, oppose, or try to reform the operation?
- What happens to current patients if the operation is shut down?

### The International Conspiracy
Evidence suggests that foreign powers are deliberately spreading black market plague treatments to destabilize the kingdom's medical system and create economic chaos.

*Investigation Elements:*
- Tracking down international smuggling networks
- Identifying foreign agents operating within the kingdom
- Understanding the political motivations behind the conspiracy
- Preventing a potential diplomatic crisis while stopping the operation
