## Session Timeline

### Opening Scene
**Location:** [[Pier 7]]
**Time:** Mid-morning, low tide
**Description:** 
The party arrives at the harbor as dock workers use hooks to pull something from the water. It's a crystallized corpse - a sailor whose body has transformed into purple crystal. As the workers lift it onto the pier, the corpse suddenly shatters with a sound like breaking glass. A pulse of violet energy erupts outward.

**Mechanical:** Everyone within 10 feet makes DC 12 Constitution save or gains 1 level of crystal exposure.

### Key Events

#### Event 1: The Shattered Sailor Investigation
**Location:** [[Pier 7]]
**NPCs:** [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Captain Lyanna Brightshield]], [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Dock Worker Toma패s|Dock Worker Tom치s]]
**Outcome:** 
- Party learns corpse wore Meridian Navy uniform
- Sailor identified as missing for 3 weeks
- Captain Brightshield recruits party to investigate
- Purist Coalition blames Crimson Hand for "magical terrorism"

#### Event 2: Information Gathering at the Siren's Rest
**Location:** [[The Siren's Rest Tavern]]
**NPCs:** [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Marina-Red-Tide-Coralheart]], various smugglers
**Outcome:**
- Marina trades information for favors
- Bar brawl between Silverscale traders and fishermen
- Learn about "singing crystals" near Forgotten Isles
- Marina provides map fragment if impressed

#### Event 3: The Quarantine Ward
**Location:** [[Harbor District Customs House]]
**NPCs:** [[Brother Marcus Steelbane]], plague victims
**Outcome:**
- Witness overwhelmed medical facilities
- Learn all victims share nightmares of drowning
- Brother Marcus hints at transmutation experiments
- Families demand access, creating moral dilemma

#### Event 4: Night Ambush
**Location:** [[Lamplight Alley]]
**NPCs:** Crystal Cult Initiates (4)
**Outcome:**
- Cultists attempt to kidnap/silence party
- Combat encounter with crystal exposure risk
- Discover vials of luminescent purple liquid
- Find coded message about meeting location

### Closing Scene
**Location:** Party's lodgings
**Cliffhanger:** 
Investigation reveals all clues point to the abandoned [[Lighthouse of Storms]] on [[Whisper Island]]. As night falls, a pillar of violet light erupts from the lighthouse, visible across the entire harbor. The light pulses three times, and every plague victim in the city screams simultaneously.

2. Crystal cult daggers (combat)
3. Investigating crystal residue (optional)

### Current Party Status
Track each character's exposure level (0-6 scale)

## Hooks for Next Session
1. Journey to [[Whisper Island]] to investigate lighthouse
2. Violet light pillar suggests major ritual or summoning
3. Synchronized screaming implies psychic connection
4. Captain Blackwater's ship might be at the island

## GM Reflections
### What Worked
- Strong opening with immediate danger
- Multiple investigation paths
- NPC variety and motivations

### What Didn't
- Track corruption exposure carefully
- Balance investigation vs. action

### To Improve
- Prepare contingency if party avoids island
- Have backup encounters ready
- Clarify corruption mechanics early

- [ ] Prepare [[The Seahawk]] ship exploration
- [ ] Design lighthouse puzzle/challenges
- [ ] Create [[Jasper Three-Eyes Flint]] NPC

1. **Minor** (1-2 points): Slight crystal veins, -1 to social checks
2. **Moderate** (3-4 points): Visible crystals, disadvantage on CON saves
3. **Major** (5-6 points): 25% crystallized, gain resistance to non-magical damage
4. **Severe** (7-8 points): 50% crystallized, lose need for food/water
5. **Critical** (9-10 points): 75% crystallized, gain telepathy with infected
6. **Complete** (11+ points): Full transformation

### Recovery Methods
