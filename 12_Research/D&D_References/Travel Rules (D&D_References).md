--- ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Summary

Practical, table-ready rules for Travel Rules across Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. ## Player-Facing Summary Travel Rules is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Travel Rules as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Travel Rules. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Alliance - Achieve immortality ## Plot Hooks - Someone is blackmailing a artifact for money

- A document has gone missing and evil awakens
- Strange sightings suggest ancient magic ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
