# Cone of Cold
*5th-level, Evocation*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/img/cone-of-cold.webp#right)

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot Cone)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small crystal or glass cone)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a blast of cold air. Each creature in a 60-foot [Cone](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/cone-area-of-effect-xphb.md) originating from you makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `8d8` Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue until it thaws.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `d8` for each spell slot level above 5.
