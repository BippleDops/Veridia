## Description
saw a boat be stove by a whale. The men on it shouted and shaked their fists and threw harpoons, but the whale dived. I thought if I could make a boat to travel underwater it would help. So I made this. With air and driver and sandbags, submerges. Let out sand to surface. Moves well with flippers on back.

## Additional Details
if operator weighs over 220, will not surface; moves at ½ regular movement; air lasts equal to operators Con in rounds; 10% chance of leakcheck once per outing
