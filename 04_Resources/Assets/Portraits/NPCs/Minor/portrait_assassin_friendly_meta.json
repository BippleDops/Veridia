    "description": "Vespara Thorne is a legendary assassin who walks the razor's edge between Aethermoor and Aquabyssos. Once a noble's daughter from the Crystal Spires, she was touched by shadow corruption during a diplomatic mission to the depths. Rather than succumb to madness, she embraced the darkness and became something new—a killer who moves between worlds like a whisper in the night.\n\nStanding 5'6\" with platinum hair streaked with shadow-black, Vespara's most striking feature is her heterochromic eyes: one crystal-blue (Aethermoor heritage), one void-black (shadow corruption). Intricate tattoos of crystalline patterns spiral down her arms, pulsing faintly with trapped shadows.\n\nShe operates from the Shadowblade District, a neutral zone where information flows like water and contracts are sealed in blood and crystal dust. Her reputation is built on three pillars: she never misses a target, she never breaks a contract, and she never kills without cause.",
