## Overview

The Phosphor Markets are a massive floating collection of bioluminescent platforms, ships, and structures that drift through [[The Gloom Gardens]], never staying in one location for more than a week.

The market's neutrality is enforced by the [[Merchant|[[Merchant]]'s Covet]], a powerful trading guild that predates [[The Drowning]].

### The Central Exchange

Massive platform made from a hollowed-out whale corpse, preserved and reinforced with magic. [[Market Master Cornelius Driftwood]] oversees all major trades from his office in what was once the creature's heart.

### The Glow Gardens

Living market stalls made from cultivated bioluminescent [[Coral]] and kelp. [[Merchant Delilah Currentrunner]] coordinates vendors selling biological goods from [[Lumengarde]].

Lower platforms dealing in goods from the dangerous depths. [[Trader Grimm Voidheart]] specializes in items from [[The Cerulean Trench]] and [[Hadal Depths|The [[Hadal Depths]]]].

### The Memory Lane

Section dedicated to pre-drowning artifacts and memories. [[Antiquarian Eliza Tidecaller]] authenticates items while [[12 Research]] trades in extracted memories.

### The Black Current

Unofficial section where illegal goods change hands. [[Shadow Merchant Riptide]] operates here, selling everything from forbidden adaptations to [[Deepmind Conspiracy]] artifacts.

### The Depth's End Tavern

Neutral meeting ground managed by [[Barkeep Salty Sarah]], serves drinks that work in both air and water. Information is the real commodity here.

### The Current Exchange Bank

Ficial institution managing the market's complex economy. [[Banker Titus Goldcurrent]] handles currency exchange between different faction monies.

### The Adaptation Parlor

[[Doctor Coral Shapeshift]] offers temporary and permanent biological modifications, from gills to pressure resistance. Not all procedures are legal or safe.

### The Dreamhouse

[[Madame Whisper]]'s establishment offers experiences from before the drowning, using [[Memory Magic]] and illusions. Highly addictive and expensive.
