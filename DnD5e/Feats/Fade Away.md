# Fade Away

## Overview

Your people are clever, with a knack for illusion magic. You have learned a magical trick for fading away when you suffer harm. You gain the following benefits:

## Effects

- Increase your Dexterity or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- Immediately after you take damage, you can use a reaction to magically become [[Invisible]] until the end of your next turn or until you attack, deal damage, or force someone to make a saving throw. Once you use this ability, you canâ€™t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
