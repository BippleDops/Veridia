--- # Familiars

*Source: Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 213* Any spellcaster that can cast the [[find-familiar-xphb (spells) spell (such as an apprentice, warlock, or wizard) is likely to have a familiar. The familiar can be one of the creatures described in the spell (see the "Player's Handbook") or some other Tiny monster, such as a [cranium-rat-mpmm (aberration)]], a [[crawling-claw-xmm (undead), a [gazer-mpmm (aberration)]], an [[Imp Xmm, a [pseudodragon-xmm (dragon)]], or a [[quasit-xmm (fiend)]]. > [!note]

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of familiars vgm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around familiars vgm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Veiled Covenant - Control trade routes ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The Hidden Prophecy of Shadows ## Plot Hooks - Strange dreams suggest ancient magic
