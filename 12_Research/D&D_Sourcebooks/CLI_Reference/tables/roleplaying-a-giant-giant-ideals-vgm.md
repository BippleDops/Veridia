**Giant Ideals**

`dice: [](roleplaying-a-giant-giant-ideals-vgm.md#^giant-ideals)`

| dice: d6 | Ideal |
|----------|-------|
| 1 | The Ordning. Annam created the ordning for the good of all giants, and it's our duty to uphold his vision. (Lawful) |
| 2 | Skill. What sets my clan apart is its mastery of our traditional crafts. (Good) |
| 3 | Strength. No other race can match the strength of giants, and none should dare to try. (Evil) |
| 4 | Lordship. Giants are the rightful rulers of the world. All will be well when our empire is restored. (Neutral) |
| 5 | Tribute. The lesser races owe giants not just respect but payment of tribute, and what they don't pay willingly, we will take by force. (Chaotic) |
| 6 | Religion. Of Annam's many sons, none is greater than my patron deity. (Any) |
