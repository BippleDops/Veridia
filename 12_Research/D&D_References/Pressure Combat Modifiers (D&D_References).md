## Summary
Practical, table-ready rules for Pressure Combat Modifiers across Aquabyssos and Aethermoor.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of Pressure Combat Modifiers as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Pressure Combat Modifiers.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
