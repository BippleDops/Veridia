An aura extends from you in a 10-foot [[emanation-area-of-effect-xphb|Emanation]] for the duration. The aura prevents creatures other than Constructs and Undead from passing or reaching through it. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with Ranged or Reach weapons through the barrier.
