When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to change the casting time to a [[bonus-action-xphb|Bonus Action]] for this casting. You can't modify a spell in this way if you've already cast a level 1+ spell on the current turn, nor can you cast a level 1+ spell on this turn after modifying a spell in this way.
