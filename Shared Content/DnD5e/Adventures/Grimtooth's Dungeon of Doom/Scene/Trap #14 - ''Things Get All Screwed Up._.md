# Trap #14 - ''Things Get All Screwed Up."
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The alcove will seem like a death trap; a dead end (I love that phrase.) Under the stucco, the walls are steel plated stone. Through the quartz wall is a lake bottom. Oh woe is the poor delvers. The answer to their prayers is just above their heads. It may not occur to them for some time but a magical spell will show the outline of a trap door in the ceiling. Chipping the stucco of the ceiling will do this as well but my guess is the average gang of would-be tomb robbers will have to nudged into looking into the ceiling for an escape.
> 
> Once the trap door is found it is easy enough to open. All you have to do is figure which one of the three finger holes is the release and gravity will do the rest. What will be revealed is the bottom of what seems to be a 5 foot round tightly spiraled stair way. The eager delvers can with some small contrivance reach the bottom step. Upon doing this they will find that the stair will slowly "screw" itself into the room. The banister of the stair turns in grooves carved into the wall until it reaches the floor. This will allow easy access to the ladder and release the trap that waits above!
> 
> The center pole of the stair extends into the ceiling at the top of the shaft up which the stair leads. As the stair case is lowered into the room the center pole will be pulled out of a chamber containing a heavier than air gas. This gas will slowly descend down the shaft as the delvers begin their walk up it. The shaft is 50 feet high, and by the time the delvers are well along, they should encounter serious breathing difficulties. Death does that to you.
> 
> Now there are those light weights who have some misplaced sense of mercy for the hapless dolts that would steal away the loot of defenseless old high level wizards. I am not one of these, but if at this point you wish to continue the show, or extend some sort of misplaced "mercy" you could make this a harmless sleeping gas, or let the "deadly" effects of Evinrood's gas only apply to those in the alcove at the bottom where the gas collects, rendering those on the stair temporarily unconscious. For my money I say let' em croak. The next bunch will bring gas masks.
> 
> The stairs will seem to dead end (There's that phrase again.) at the top. But with the judicious use of a boot the delvers will emerge through the thin sheet of stucco-covered rock into a corridor. (See main map.)
> 
> The stairs are four skulls if used correcay, but far less if the gas effects are limited.
