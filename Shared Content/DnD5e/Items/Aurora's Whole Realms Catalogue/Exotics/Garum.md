## Description
I first became acquainted with this salty sauce of fermented fish and other flavorings in the jungles of Malatra, where it was used to add tang to all manner of dishes. Now, using a recipe brought back from the far reaches of the east, I am able to offer this superior condiment for use at your table. (10 gp/gal.)
