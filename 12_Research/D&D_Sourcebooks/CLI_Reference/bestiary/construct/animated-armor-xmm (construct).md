*Source: Monster Manual (2024) p. 16. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* Animated suits of armor might move with steady deliberateness or awkward gaits. They're often constructed from plate armor, making them easy to mistake for soldiers or helmed horrors. Other types of armor or even metal statuary might also become animated armor. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Animated Objects *Mundane Objects Come to Life* - **Habitat.** Urban - **Treasure.** None Magic can manipulate mundane items, compelling them to perform simple tasks. Such animate objects might be unassuming tools or decorations that can defend their creator. These objects follow simple instructions from whatever force or magic-user created them. If left unattended, they might defend an area for ages or repeat a task until they wear out. Roll on or choose a result from the Animated Object Catalysts table to inspire what sort of magic motivates an ambulatory item. > [!quote] A quote from Levity Quickstitch, Rogue > > Lyin' next to the chest were the bones of Cap'n Scornblade himself, still clutchin' his rusty sword.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of animated armor xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around animated armor xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A stranger needs help stealing before the festival
