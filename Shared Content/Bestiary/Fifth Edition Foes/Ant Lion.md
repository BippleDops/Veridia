## Description
The ant lion is a vicious insectlike creature that lurks at the bottoms of pits and holes, feeding on those unfortunates that fall in. An ant lion is about 9 feet long and weighs nearly 700 pounds. Ant lions dig deep, funnel-shaped pits in which to trap their prey. An ant lion pit is about 60 feet across and about 20 feet deep. A creature that steps on the pit must make a successful DC 16 Dexterity (Acrobatics) save or slip and fall into the funnel. It is there the ant lion waits, buried just under the surface of the ground. When prey falls to the center of the funnel, the ant lion surfaces and attacks, using its mandibles to grab and tear its prey. An ant lion never releases its grapple voluntarily.
