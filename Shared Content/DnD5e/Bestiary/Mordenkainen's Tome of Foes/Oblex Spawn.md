***Aversion to Fire.*** If the oblex takes fire damage, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.

## Description
An oblex devours memories not only to sustain its existence, but also to spawn new oblexes. Each time it fully drains the memories of a victim, it gains the creature's personalityâ€”now twisted by the oblex's foul nature. The more memories an oblex steals, the larger it becomes, until it must shed a personality it has absorbed or else go insane. This act spawns a new oblex.
