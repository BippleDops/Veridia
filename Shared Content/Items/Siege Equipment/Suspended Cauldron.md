# Suspended Cauldron
## Overview
*Large object*

**Armor Class**: 19

**Hit Points**: 20

**Damage Immunities**: poison, psychic

A [[Cauldron|cauldron]] is an iron [[Pot|pot]] suspended so that it can be tipped easily, spilling its contents. Once emptied, a [[Cauldron|cauldron]] must be refilled-and its contents must usually be reheated- before it can be used again. It takes three actions to fill a [[Cauldron|cauldron]] and one action to tip it.

Cauldrons can be filled with other liquids, such as [[Acid|acid]] or green slime, with different effects.

**Boiling [[Oil]]**. The [[Cauldron|cauldron]] pours boiling [[Oil|oil]] onto a 10-foot-square area directly below it. Any creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (`dice: 3d6`) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
