They often dwell beyond the fringes of civilization or travel in disguise, leaving trails of [[conditions#Petrified|petrified]] victims. Some medusas dominate groups of monsters or criminals, controlling them with threats of [[conditions#Petrified|petrified]] doom, while others recruit servants that are immune to being [[conditions#Petrified|petrified]], such as gargoyles and gorgons. Medusas are born or created through preternatural circumstances. Roll on or choose a result from the Medusa Fates table to inspire what led to a medusa's creation. **Medusa Fates**`dice: [](medusa-xmm.md#^medusa-fates)`| dice: 1d6 | The Medusa Was... |

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of medusa xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around medusa xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The First Prophecy of Winds ## Plot Hooks - Strange sightings suggest a conspiracy
