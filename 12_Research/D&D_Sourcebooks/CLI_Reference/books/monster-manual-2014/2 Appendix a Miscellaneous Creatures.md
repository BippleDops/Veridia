This appendix contains statistics for various animals, vermin, and other critters. The stat blocks are organized alphabetically by creature name.

> [!note] Other Animals
> 
> A book of this size can't contain statistics for every animal inhabiting your D&D campaign world. However, you can use the stat block of one animal to represent another easily enough. For example, you can use the panther statistics to represent a jaguar, the giant goat statistics to represent a buffalo, and the hawk statistics to represent a falcon.
