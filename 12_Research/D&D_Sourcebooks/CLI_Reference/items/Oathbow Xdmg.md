--- # Oathbow

*Very rare (requires attunement)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/oathbow.webp#right) When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, "Swift defeat to my enemies." When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can utter or sign the following command words: "Swift death to you who have wronged me." The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn 7 days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn. When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have [[Advantage Xphb]] on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from [[Cover Xphb]] or [[Cover Xphb]], and you suffer no [[Advantage Xphb]] due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra`3d6`Piercing damage. While your sworn enemy lives, you have [[Advantage Xphb]] on attack rolls with all other weapons. **Variants**:
- [Oath Longbow](#Oath%20Longbow)
- [Oath Shortbow](#Oath%20Shortbow) ### Oath Shortbow - **Damage**: 1d6 piercing

- **Range**: 80/320

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of oathbow xdmg as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around oathbow xdmg. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
