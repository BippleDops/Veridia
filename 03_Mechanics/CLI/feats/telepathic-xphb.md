# Telepathic
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 208*  

**Prerequisite**: 4th

You gain the following benefits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20.

**Telepathic Utterance.** You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Your telepathic utterances are in a language you know, and the creature understands you only if it knows that language. Your communication doesn't give the creature the ability to respond to you telepathically.

**Detect Thoughts.** You always have the [Detect Thoughts](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/detect-thoughts-xphb.md) spell prepared. You can cast it without a spell slot or spell components, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in this way again. You can also cast it using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Your spellcasting ability for the spell is the ability increased by this feat.

## Player-Facing Summary

Telepathic xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of telepathic xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around telepathic xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties telepathic xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at telepathic xphb to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to telepathic xphb active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
