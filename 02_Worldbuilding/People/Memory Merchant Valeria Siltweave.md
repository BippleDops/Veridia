**Ethical Memory Exchange (Recharge 5-6).** Valeria facilitates a voluntary memory exchange between two willing creatures within 60 feet.

## Deep Personal Background & Nuance

### Childhood Memories & Formative Experiences
- **The Memory Thief's Daughter**: Born to Marcus Siltweave, a notorious memory extractor who stole precious memories from the elderly and dying; spent childhood watching him destroy families while amassing wealth
- **The Grandmother's Last Gift (Age 12)**: Her dying grandmother deliberately gave Valeria all her most beautiful memories before Marcus could steal them; experienced 60 years of love, joy, and wisdom in a single overwhelming moment
- **The First Witnessing (Age 14)**: Watched her father extract a mother's memories of her dead children, leaving the woman empty and broken; vomited for hours afterward and began questioning everything she'd been taught

- **The Rebellion Choice (Age 19)**: Discovered her father was selling traumatic memories as "entertainment" to wealthy sadists; confronted him with evidence and was disowned when she refused to continue the family business
- **The Mentor's Kindness**: Dr. Helena Mindweaver, an ethical memory researcher, found teenage Valeria homeless and broken; taught her that memory work could heal rather than harm
- **The Survivor's Network**: Connected with other children of memory exploiters; their shared experiences of inherited guilt and determination to reform the industry became her chosen family

### Personal Habits & Daily Self-Care
- **The Cleansing Ritual**: Each morning, "washes" her mind by reviewing positive memories from willing donors; believes this protects her from residual trauma absorption
