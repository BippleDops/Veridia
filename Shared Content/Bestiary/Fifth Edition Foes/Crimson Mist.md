*Seemingly made of red vapor, the crimson mist is an outstanding stealth hunter. It is vaguely humanoid in shape, with what appear to be arms, a torso, and a head, but where a humanoid would have legs, the crimson mist’s body trails away into crimson vapor. The creature has no distinct facial features, other than two glowing points where eyes should be.*

## Special Traits
**Engulf:** When a crimson mist strikes a target with one of its tentacles, it can immediately make an engulf attack by entering the opponent's space. The engulfed creature can attempt a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to evade the attack. Success indicates the character avoids the attack entirely by retreating or stepping aside as the crimson mist moves forward. Failure indicates the crimson mist's body encloses the target, trapping the target inside. An engulfed character is restrained, takes 7 (`dice: 2d6`) necrotic and psychic damage at the start of each of its turns, and immediately begins suffocating. An engulfed character can escape by winning a Dexterity contest against the crimson mist. A crimson mist can engulf only one Medium or smaller creature at a time, and doing so prevents it from attacking with one of its tentacles.

**Susceptibility:** If a creature dies from the crimson mist's engulf attack, the crimson mist's speed drops to 30 ft., its Stealth bonus drops to +3 (it flushes crimson, hence the name), and attacks against it have tactical advantage. These effects last for 1 hour.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A crimson mist attacks twice with tentacles.

**Tentacle:** *Melee Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (`dice: 1d8+4`) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled and engulfed (see above).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Swamp or underground

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
A crimson mist usually hides in naturally occurring fog and waits for potential prey to wander close. Although they are not known to converse, crimson mists have been known to mimic cries for help or other sounds in an attempt to lure a victim into its grasp.

What appear at first sight to be arms are actually tentacles with smaller, fingerlike tentacles at their ends. A crimson mist looks s if it’s composed of thick, swirling vapor, but its body is surmised to be an unknown, fifth state of matter that shares some of the qualities of solid, gas, liquid, and plasma without actually being any of those.
