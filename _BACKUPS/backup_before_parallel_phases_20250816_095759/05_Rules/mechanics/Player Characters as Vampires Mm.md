--- # Player Characters as Vampires

*Source: Monster Manual p. 295, Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft p. 236* The game statistics of a player character transformed into a [[vampire-spawn-xmm (undead) and then a [Vampire Xmm (undead)]] don't change, except that the character's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores become 18 if they aren't higher. In addition, the character gains the vampire's damage resistances, [[senses#Darkvision|darkvision, traits, and actions. Attack and damage rolls for the vampire's attacks are based on Strength. The save DC for Charm is 8 + the vampire's proficiency bonus + the vampire's Charisma modifier. The character's alignment becomes lawful evil, and the DM might take control of the character until the vampirism is reversed with a [wish-xphb (spells)]] spell or the character is killed and brought back to life. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Jiangshi
