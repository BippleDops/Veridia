# Skycastle (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *9th-level*

**School**: *transmutation*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 10 minutes

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a richly-appointed chair, sofa, or other form of seating worth at least 10,000 gp)

**Duration**: Permanent


## Effects
You place a special seat in the center of a building of no more than 1 million square feet (a castle and environs; approximately 23 acres) and remain seated in it the entire time you cast this spell. Prior to casting this spell, you must also walk every inch of the building, over and over again, for an entire month.

This spell causes the building and its im-mediate surroundings to rise into the air. When you sit in the chair, you may move the building upwards to a maximum height of 1,500 feet, or have it fly at a speed of 10 feet.

If this spell is successfully dispelled, the building will float gently downwards for 30 seconds and then plummet the rest of the way. If it falls more than 200 feet, the castle is destroyed and everything inside and underneath it is killed.
