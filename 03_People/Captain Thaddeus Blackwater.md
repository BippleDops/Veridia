## Overview
Captain Thaddeus Blackwater was [[Aethermoor's most famous explorer before his expedition vanished in [The Crystalline Wastes]] two months ago. Secretly funded by [[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]] to find the Seventh Shard, he discovered something that changed everything—but his final message was cut short.

### The Mission
> [!warning] DM Only
> Queen Seraphina secretly hired him to find the Seventh Shard, providing:
> - Map from [[The Crimson Sage
> - Crystal-resistant equipment
> - 50,000 gold pieces funding
> - Royal writs of passage

### The Route
1. Started from [Crystalhaven]]
2. Resupplied at Wanderer's Refuge
3. Entered deep wastes
4. Last camp found at Mirror Lakes
5. Trail ends at Corruption's Heart

### Final Message (Partial)
*"Day 47... found it... not what we expected... the singing... it's alive... God help us, the Sage was right... the crown never broke, it was planted... sending coordinates... if we don't return, do NOT—"* [Message ends]

### What He Found
> [!warning] DM Only - The Truth
> Discovered the Seventh Shard moves through the crystal network like a living thing. Found evidence that the Crystallization was intentional—Aetheron planned his own shattering. The expedition is alive but transformed, serving as guardians for something at Corruption's Heart.

### Three Possibilities
1. **Dead**: Killed by corruption or creatures
2. **Transformed**: Crystallized but conscious
3. **Hidden**: Found something requiring them to hide

### Hidden Cache
> Left supply caches with information:
> - Location 1: Warning about [[The Crimson Sage
> - Location 2: Partial cure for corruption
> - Location 3: Map to the Seventh Shard's pattern

### The Lost Expedition
Finding him is a major quest involving:
1. Following his route
2. Discovering his caches
3. Understanding his findings
4. Rescue or recovery
5. Revealing the truth

### Possible States
1. **Mad Prophet**: Driven insane by revelations
2. **Crystal Hybrid**: Partially transformed but rational
3. **Guardian**: Protecting dangerous secret
4. **Prisoner**: Held by ancient entity
5. **Changed**: No longer entirely human

## Speaking Style (From Journals)
*"The wastes sing at night. Sarah thinks it's wind through crystals, but I know better. It's calling us deeper."*

*"We found writing in the crystals today. Not on them—IN them. As if the crystal grew around the words."*

*"The Queen must never know what her Sage really is. God help us all if she does."*
