# High Tidecaller Nerissa Deepcurrent

## Description

Nerissa appears ageless, though she has ruled for nearly two centuries. Her silver hair flows constantly as if underwater even in air pockets, and her skin has a subtle pearl-like shimmer. She wears robes woven from crystallized water that shift and flow with her movements. Her eyes change color with her emotions - deep blue when calm, storm green when angered, grey when sorrowful.

## Background

Born into the Oracle bloodline that predicted the Great Submersion, Nerissa was raised from birth to lead Aquabyssos. She witnessed the last days of the surface empire through inherited memories and carries the weight of three thousand years of isolation. Her grandmother was the last Oracle to speak with [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Emperor Thalassius the Wise]] before his sacrifice.

### Rise to Power
- Age 7: First prophetic vision
- Age 16: Chosen as Tide Apprentice
- Age 45: Became youngest Council member
- Age 127: Unanimous election as High Tidecaller
- Age 298: Current day, longest-serving leader

## Political Position

### Allies
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]]** - Military commander, trusted but stubborn
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Master of Currents Zephyr]]** - Chief advisor, childhood friend
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Pearl Guard]]** - Elite protectors

### Rivals
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/The_Crimson_Pearl|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Pearl]]** - Necessary evil, controls too much trade
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]]** - Dangerous idealist threatening stability
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Aboleth Prime Yoth]]** - Ancient threat that must be contained

### Neutral Parties
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Surface Ambassador Lord Seaworthy]]** - Useful but untrustworthy
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Depth Wardens]]** - Loyal to Aquabyssos, not necessarily to her

## Current Concerns

### The Second Rising Prophecy
Her own visions show two paths:
1. Aquabyssos rises and burns in the sun
2. Aquabyssos stays and drowns in darkness
She seeks a third option but hasn't found it.

### The Pressure Wars
- [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Pearl_Harbor_City]] grows too independent
- [[02_Worldbuilding/Quests/The Maw of Darkness]] stirs with ancient evil
- Resources stretched thin across seven depths
