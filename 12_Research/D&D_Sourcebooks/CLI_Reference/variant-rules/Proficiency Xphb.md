# Proficiency
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 372. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

If you have proficiency with something, you can add your Proficiency Bonus to any [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb|D20 Test]] you make using that thing. A creature might have proficiency in a skill or [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/saving-throw-xphb|saving throw]] or with a weapon or tool.
