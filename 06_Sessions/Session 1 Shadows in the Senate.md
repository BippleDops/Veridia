# Session 1: Shadows in the Senate
* The Shadow Conspiracy Investigation Begins*

> [!info] Session Overview
> **Duration**: 4-6 hours
> **Level Range**: 5-8
> **Focus**: Investigation, Social Encounters, Light Combat
> **Location**: Parliament of Echoes, Aquabyssos
> **Key Theme**: Something is terribly wrong with democracy

### The Impossible Vote

* Read aloud:*
> The grand chamber of the Parliament of Echoes resonates with an unnatural harmony. Where once heated debates echoed off the coral-carved walls, now only uimous agreement flows like a dark tide. The Speaker calls for a vote on the "Emergency Powers Act" - a bill that would effectively dissolve democratic oversight.
>
> "All in favor?" 
> Every hand rises in perfect synchronization. Not a single voice of dissent. Not even a moment's hesitation. The watching crowd gasps as even historically opposed parties vote as one.
> In the observation gallery, you notice a parliamentary aide's face go pale. She clutches a portfolio to her chest and rushes toward the exit, glancing fearfully over her shoulder. As she passes your group, she stumbles, dropping a single document that reads: "HELP - THEY'RE NOT THEMSELVES ANYMORE."

### Initial Reactions

**Perception DC 12**: Notice several parliament members have identical posture
**Insight DC 14**: Recognize the terror in the aide's eyes is genuine
**History DC 13**: Remember these parties have never agreed on anything
**Arcana DC 16**: Detect faint necrotic energy in the chamber

### The Aide's Plea

**Marina Currentswift** (Parliamentary Aide)
- Young triton woman, visibly shaking
- Knows something is wrong but not what
- Afraid she's being watched
- Will only talk in private

* If approached:*
> "Please, not here. They have eyes everywhere now. Meet me at the Drowned Scholar tavern tonight. Back room. Come alone - or at least look like you are. I'll explain everything I can, but... but you have to promise to help. Democracy is dying and no one else seems to notice or care."

### Path A: Parliamentary Records

**Location**: Parliamentary Archive
**Guardian**: Archivist Kelp-Tome (shadow-touched)

**Challenges**:
1. Gain access (Persuasion DC 15 or Deception DC 17)
2. Navigate archive maze (Investigation DC 14)
3. Find voting records (History DC 13)
4. Avoid Archivist's suspicion (Stealth DC 16)

**Discoveries**:
- Last 7 votes were uimous (unprecedented)
- Voting happened faster than physically possible
- Some members voted while officially absent
- **Evidence**: Impossible Voting Records (1 point)

**If Caught**: Archivist attacks with shadow tendrils

  - name: Memory Drain
    desc: "One grappled creature must make a DC 13 Wisdom save or forget the last hour."
```

### Path B: Staff Interviews

**Location**: Parliamentary Offices
**Key NPCs**: Various staff members

**Interview Subjects**:
1. **Secretary Coral-Ink**: Noticed schedule changes
2. **Guard Captain Trident**: Reports security anomalies  
3. **Janitor Algae-Sweep**: Saw late-night "meetings"
4. **Chef Brine-Spice**: Parliament members stopped eating

**Social Encounter Mechanics**:
- Each NPC starts at Trust 0
- Successful Persuasion/Insight increases Trust by 1
- Intimidation works but alerts conspiracy
- At Trust 3, NPC shares crucial information

**Information Gained**:
- Parliament members arrive/leave at exact same times
- Secret late-night gatherings in basement
- Dietary changes (no longer eat normal food)
- Strange surgical scars on necks
- **Evidence**: Staff Testimony (1 point per 2 witnesses)

### Path C: Shadow Parliament Member

**Target**: Councilor Reef-Garden
**Location**: Private office

**Observation** (Stealth DC 15):
- Watches shadow duplicate in mirror
- Speaks to someone not present
- References "the surgery" and "prime directive"
- Temperature drops noticeably near them

**Direct Confrontation**:
- Denies everything perfectly
- No emotional response to accusations
- If pressed, claims party is delusional
- If violence threatened, calls guards

**Shadow Test** (requires creative approach):
- Mirror shows different reflection
- Doesn't remember childhood memories
- Can't eat normal food (Constitution save)
- Reacts to shadow detection magic

### Evening Rendezvous

**Atmosphere**:
> The Drowned Scholar squats in the Deepwater District like a barnacle-encrusted secret. Water drips constantly from the ceiling, and bioluminescent algae provides the only light. Marina waits in the back room, hood drawn up, hands shaking as she nurses a cup of kelp wine.
