# The Cerulean Trench - The Drowning Scar

## Overview
The Cerulean Trench is a massive underwater canyon that many believe was the origin point of [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Great Drowning. Stretching for hundreds of miles and plunging to unknown depths, its waters glow with an unnatural blue light - pure [02_Worldbuilding/People/The Cerulean Breath]] in its most concentrated form. Strange creatures, ancient ruins, and reality-warping phenomena make it one of the most dangerous regions in Aquabyssos World Overview.

## Regions

### The Azure Shelf (5000-7000 feet)
The "shallow" entry area where [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Depth Wardens maintain observation posts. [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Scout Captain Vera Deepwatch]] leads expeditions from Outpost Sigma, the last "safe" structure before the true trench.

### The Luminous Drop (7000-10000 feet)
Vertical cliff faces lined with glowing crystalline formations. [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Trencher Folk have settlements carved into the walls here, led by [02_Worldbuilding/People/Elder Whisper-In-The-Dark]].

### The Pressure Cathedral (10000-12000 feet)
A region where water pressure creates natural formations resembling gothic architecture. [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Mad Prophet Silas the Depth-Touched claims to receive visions from [02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Deepmind]] here.

### The Void Gardens (12000-15000 feet)
Forests of giant kelp that shouldn't exist at this depth, feeding on the Cerulean Breath itself. [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Doctor Silas Voidtouch harvests specimens here for his experiments in [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Lumengarde]].

### The Unknown Deep (15000+ feet)
No one who has descended below 15000 feet has returned sane. Expedition logs speak of "singing stones" and "the dreaming city."

## Notable Features

### The Drowning Gate
Massive stone archway at 8000 feet, covered in pre-drowning runes. Water passing through takes on deeper blue coloration. [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Sage Lysander Deepthought believes it's a portal to the source of the flooding.

### The Memory Streams
Currents of pure Cerulean Breath that show visions of the past to those who swim through them. Highly addictive and mentally dangerous.

### The Titan's Graveyard
Collection of massive skeletons from creatures that shouldn't exist. [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Beast Master Krell Chainbreaker]] claims one skeleton is still partially alive.

### The Echo Chamber
Natural formation that amplifies sound across impossible distances. [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Free Current uses it to send coded messages.

### The First Temple
Partially collapsed structure that predates the drowning by millennia. Contains references to "the sleeping one" and "the necessary flood."

## Inhabitants

### The Trencher Folk
Humans who have adapted to extreme depths through disturbing modifications. They worship the trench itself and trade depth-crystals for supplies.

### Cerulean Spawn
Creatures mutated by concentrated exposure to the Cerulean Breath. Includes:
- Glass eels that can phase through matter
- Pressure sharks that implode their prey
- Thought-jellies that feed on memories
- Depth angels (origin unknown, possibly hallucinations)

### The Lost Expeditions
Various groups that went too deep and never returned, occasionally spotted as ghostly figures in the blue glow.

## Hazards
- **Pressure Cascades**: Sudden pressure changes that can crush or explode victims
- **Cerulean Poisoning**: Overexposure causing physical and mental transformation
- **Depth Madness**: Psychological condition causing suicidal desire to descend
- **Temporal Eddies**: Areas where time flows differently
- **The Call**: Psychic summons drawing victims deeper

## Resources
- **Depth Crystals**: Formed under extreme pressure, store massive magical energy
- **Cerulean Pearls**: Concentrated Cerulean Breath in solid form
- **Pressure Wood**: Compressed ancient trees, harder than steel
- **Memory Shards**: Crystallized memories from the drowning
- **Void Kelp**: Alchemical component for depth resistance potions

## Current Activity
1. Increased creature migrations toward the surface
2. The blue glow intensifying over past months
3. [02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Order of the Sunken Crown]] expedition hasn't returned
4. Tremors suggesting something massive moving below
5. Trencher Folk fleeing upward, refusing to say why

## Secrets
> [!warning] DM Only
> - The trench is the prison of the entity that caused the drowning
> - The Cerulean Breath is the entity's blood/essence
> - The Trencher Folk are its unwitting servants
> - At the bottom lies the entity's physical form, slowly awakening
> - The Drowning Gate is counting down to something

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties The Cerulean Trench to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
