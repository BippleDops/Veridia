- **Aquabyssos**: Deep currents bring cold water, increased pressure effects
- **Aethermoor**: Storm season intensifies, altitude effects more dangerous
- **Mechanical Effect**: +2 DC to environmental Constitution saves **Spring (Wind Awakening, Sky Dancing, Crystal Growing)**:
- **Aquabyssos**: Warming currents, increased biological activity
- **Aethermoor**: Calmer winds, optimal flying conditions
- **Mechanical Effect**: Advantage on Nature and Survival checks **Summer (High Currents, Storm Crown, Deep Calling)**:
- **Aquabyssos**: Strongest currents, most dangerous depths accessible
- **Aethermoor**: Peak storm activity, maximum wind speeds
- **Mechanical Effect**: Enhanced travel speed but increased weather hazards **Autumn (Shadow Turning, Memory Tide, Unity Dawn)**:
- **Aquabyssos**: Mysterious tidal phenomena, enhanced magic
- **Aethermoor**: Unpredictable weather patterns, aurora effects
- **Mechanical Effect**: Magic functions unpredictably (DM discretion) ### Moon Phase Effects **The Deep Pearl** (Aquabyssos-aligned moon):

- **New Moon**: Darkness enhances shadow magic, creatures more aggressive
- **Full Moon**: Tidal magic at peak power, emotional effects amplified
- **Waxing/Waning**: Gradual changes in pressure and magical intensity **The Wind Crystal** (Aethermoor-aligned moon):
- **New Moon**: Stillest air, flying becomes difficult
- **Full Moon**: Hurricane-force winds possible, storm magic enhanced - **Waxing/Waning**: Weather becomes increasingly unpredictable ### Shard Resoce Events name: "Shard Resoce Pulse" date: "High Currents 15, 1247" description: "All seven shards pulse simultaneously. Reality distortions occur worldwide." category: "cosmic-event" recurring: "every-28-days" name: "Memory Tide Peak" date: "Memory Tide 15, 1247" type: "psychic" description: "Annual peak of consciousness-affecting phenomena.

Corruption spreads rapidly." category: "seasonal-event" ### Critical Timeline Pressure Points **Session 3 Deadline**: "The Memory Palace must be secured before the next Resoce Pulse" **Consequence**: If delayed, consciousness corruption spreads to Queen Seraphina's entire court **Session 6 Deadline**: "The Storm Shard must be stabilized before Storm Crown month ends" **Consequence**: If delayed, permanent weather chaos affects both worlds **Session 9 Deadline**: "The convergence decision must be made before Unity Dawn" **Consequence**: If delayed, Deep Mother reforms automatically with no input from heroes ### Session Timing Recommendations **Optimal Pacing**: One session per week in-game time allows for:

- Natural consequence development
- NPC reaction and adaptation time - Environmental changes to manifest
- Political situations to evolve **Accelerated Pacing**: Multiple sessions per in-game week for:
- High-pressure urgent situations
- Back-to-back dungeon exploration
- Crisis management scenarios
- Time-sensitive investigations **Extended Pacing**: One session per month in-game time for:
- Political intrigue development
- Long-term consequence exploration
- Character relationship building
- Economic and social change manifestation ### Session Date Tracker```meta-bind
