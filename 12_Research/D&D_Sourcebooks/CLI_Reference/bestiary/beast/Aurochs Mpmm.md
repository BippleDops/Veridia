*Source: Mordenkainen Presents: Monsters of the Multiverse p. 71, Volo's Guide to Monsters p. 207* An aurochs is a large, fierce bovine with jutting horns. In many lands, herds of aurochs roam free, while elsewhere orcs and humans train them from an early age to carry riders into combat. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Cattle Many kinds of cattle roam the multiverse, some of them domesticated and others feral. In many cultures, cattle are almost like family to the folk who tend to them.```statblock

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of aurochs mpmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around aurochs mpmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - An heirloom has gone missing and evil awakens
