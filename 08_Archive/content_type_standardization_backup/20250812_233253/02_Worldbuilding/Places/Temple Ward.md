> [!secret] DM Secret
> The thermal vents that power the Temple Ward are actually maintained by an ancient agreement with a powerful water elemental lord who dwells deep beneath the city. This being, known as [[The Deepmost Current]], requires regular offerings and ceremonies to maintain the sacred waters' power. Only the highest-ranking clergy know of this arrangement, and they carefully maintain the traditions that keep the elemental satisfied. If the agreement were broken, the Ward would lose its healing properties and much of its spiritual power, potentially triggering religious crisis throughout the kingdom.
