_Source: Princes of the Apocalypse_ If Marlos is in the earth node while [[Ogremoch Pota isn't, the medusa can take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), Marlos uses a lair action to cast [earthquake-xphb (spells)]] without using components. As long as he maintains [[conditions#Concentration|concentration on [earthquake-xphb (spells)]], initiative count 20 is the start of Marlos's turn for the purpose of the spell. He can take no other lair actions while [[conditions#Concentration|concentrating on [earthquake-xphb (spells)]]. Marlos's second option for a lair action is to draw power from the earth node to heal. When he does so, he regains 30 (``dice: 6d8` + 3`) hit points. ## Player-Facing Summary Marlos urnrayle pota is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of marlos urnrayle pota as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around marlos urnrayle pota. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Alliance - Manipulate succession ## Related Notes - [[Similar Topic 1
