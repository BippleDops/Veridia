## Description
This [[Javelin|javelin]] is a [[Magic Weapon|magic weapon]]. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a [[2 - Casting a Spell|line]] 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a [[4 - Ability Checks|DC]] 13 [[Dexterity|Dexterity]] saving throw, taking `dice: 4d6` (4d6) [[17 - Damage and Healing|lightning]] damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon [[14 - Actions in Combat|attack]] against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus `dice: 4d6` (4d6) [[17 - Damage and Healing|lightning]] damage.

The [[Javelin|javelin]]’s property can’t be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a [[Magic Weapon|magic weapon]].

**Thrown**. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.
