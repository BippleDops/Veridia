## Special Traits
**Control Water (1/Day):** A mummy of the deep can control water as the spell by using an action.

**Curse of the Deep:** When a mummy of the deep grapples a creature, it immediately uses a bonus action to press its mouth against the opponent's and spew sea water into the opponent's lungs. It then releases its grapple. The affected creature must make a successful DC 11 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns. An affected creature can act normally on a round when it makes a successful saving throw; if the saving throw fails, the creature takes 3 (`dice: 1d6`) necrotic damage and is stunned until the start of its next turn. The effect ends when the affected creature makes a third successful save. It can also be ended by a spell or other magical effect that neutralizes a curse.

**Despair:** At the sight of a mummy of the deep within 60 feet, the viewer must make a successful DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for `dice: 1d4` rounds. If the saving throw result is 5 or less, the creature is paralyzed instead. A successful saving throw renders the creature immune to any mummy of the deep's despair for 24 hours.
