# Group Patrons
*Source: Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy, p. 28* 

There are ten group patrons in this chapter. Each of the group patrons includes two characters that are contacts for the player characters. If you aren't using a group patron then you can use the characters as extra villains or even henchmen for your campaign villain. You can allow your players to use the stores and other benefits of an unused group patron, but a good rule of thumb is to increase the cost by 150%.

## Adventurer's Guild

Your group belongs to the Adventurer's Guild, a loose organization that supports those courageous—or foolhardy—enough to pick up the professional mantle of adventuring.

Adventurers are a varied lot, ranging from less scrupulous bounty hunters, mercenaries and treasure hunters to more altruistic archeologists and explorers. But they share a common bond—all are thrill seekers who live luxuriously off the spoils they find in monster infested ruins and dungeons... assuming they continue to live.

The Adventurer's Guild actively recruits young men and women to join their ranks by extoling the glamorous adventurer lifestyle: the gold and riches, the fame, and the groupies. Wide eyed neophytes—blinded by promises of extravagant rewards and lavish lifestyles–are quick to sign up. But those who actually achieve the dream of wealth and fame are few and far between. Most adventurers toil in obscurity, scrabbling to make ends meet as they chase that elusive "big score" that will vault them into the upper echelons of the Guild.

For those lucky or talented enough to forge their own legends, the rewards are truly magnificent: fame and adulation, not to mention wealth to rival that of any merchant or monarch. Yet even those that achieve success are often plagued by metaphorical (and sometimes literal!) demons. The horrors they face on a regular basis are rarely discussed in detail, but many adventurers turn to drinking, drugs, gambling, and other vices in a desperate attempt to drown out the trauma of what they have witnessed. However, this dark underbelly of the adventurer's life is rarely discussed. The Guild prefers to celebrate its rare successes—the icons, legends and heroes that inspire the dream in fresh new recruits.

### Adventurer's Guild Operatives

The Adventurer's Guild doesn't really have operatives so much as it has roles.

#### Cartographer

Every adventuring band needs someone who maps out the dungeons, ruins and tombs. There is no point finding the treasure if you can't find your way back out.

#### Zoologist

Unless an adventuring band wants to get slaughtered, someone has to keep up to date on the strengths and weaknesses of monsters that might be encountered.

#### Historian

[History](/rules/skills.md#History) can help an adventuring band avoid repeating the mistakes of their predecessors... like waltzing into the den of a demi-lich.

#### Faceman

This is the role that youths across Faerûn dream of becoming: the leader of the band; the iconic hero. These are the poster children for the Guild; the ones who will have beautiful men and women waiting for them in every town, eager to spend even one night with a living legend.

### Adventurer's Guild Quests

### Adventurer's Guild Perks

These perks require an annual contribution of 10 gp paid to the guild. These dues fund the guild's services and activities.

#### Adventurer's Guildhall

Almost every town and city has an adventurer's guildhall. The rooms match up to those in a modest inn, but at a lower price (1 sp per day).

#### Fence

It is much easier for you to sell magic items. Any magic item that you want to sell can be sold for its full price. Common and uncommon magic items take a day to sell. Rare and very rare items take 1d10 days. Legendary items take 1d4 weeks.

#### Magic Items

Guildhalls provide you with a huge network of fellow adventurers. This makes it easier to find specific magic items for purchase.

#### Henchmen

You can hire henchmen at any adventurer's guildhall. These henchmen are willing to accompany you on dangerous adventures if you are willing to pay their daily rate. However, if you ever ask them to perform a risky task, such as engage in battle, you must succeed on an [Intimidation](/rules/skills.md#Intimidation) or [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion) check. Other risky tasks include scouting out dangerous areas and reporting back or checking a hallway for traps. You can only have one henchman at a time.

## Candlekeep

Candlekeep is a library-fortress on the Sword Coast and famed for being the greatest collection of books and scrolls in Faerûn. Exceptional scholars and wizards visit Candlekeep at least once in their lifetimes, if not many more times. Because of this, the monks have many allies to call upon if Candlekeep is ever in danger. Powerful archmages such as Alustriel, Elminster and the Simbul will all come to the library's aid if needed.

Candlekeep is considered a great temple to many of the gods of knowledge, including Oghma, Gond, Deneir and Milil. It has been the home to many of the world's most famous sages, including the great prophet, Alaundo.

The librarians of Candlekeep have one absolute rule: "Those who destroy knowledge, with ink, fire, or sword, are themselves destroyed".

> [!quote]- A quote from Volo

You can learn a new language while at Candlekeep. It takes ten workweeks to learn a new language. This time can be reduced by a number of workweeks equal to your Intelligence modifier.

In order to find the appropriate recipe, you must have an [Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana) bonus equal to or higher than what is listed. Most recipes have prerequisite material components, often requiring you to hunt down a specific kind of monster. To craft the item, you must spend gold equal to the material cost. Some items require the aid of a powerful assistant to craft. You only need the assistant for a single day. You can either use [Persuasion](/rules/skills.md#Persuasion) or charm magic to get their assistance.

## Church of Sune

Sune is the goddess of beauty, also known as Lady Firehair and the Lady of Love. She represents not only physical beauty, but the beauty of music, fragrances and delicious foods. Her worshippers seek out the pleasure that comes from experiencing beauty in all its forms.

The Church of Sune believes that all mortals deserve the opportunity to experience beauty during their brief lives. The church goes about ensuring that this opportunity exists in two manners. The first is the support of artistic endeavors. This covers a wide variety of ventures including culinary arts, music, painting, sculpting and others. Clerics of Sune seek out exceptional artistic talent and provide them with monetary grants or help them become members of prestigious organizations.

The second focus of the church is much more pragmatic. The church uses its vast monetary resources to support civilization in all its forms; for without cities, towns and roads, there would not be theaters, restaurants, art galleries and all of the other venues that allow for the appreciation of beauty. The church pays for the construction of roads, forts and caravansaries so that travel between cities is less dangerous. They donate to military orders that defend civilization such as the Order of the Gauntlet and the Harpers. They work hard to make sure that the Lord's Alliance is well funded and try to smooth over squabbles between the city states that make up its membership. Because of this, there are more worshippers of Sune amongst the nobility of the Lord's Alliance than any other god or goddess.

Temples to Sune often include venues for appreciating the arts or are built within a city district that includes them. A temple might include a vast public bathhouse with heated plumbing, or a multistory theater to allow for nightly plays or musical performances.

### Church of Sune Operatives

#### Heartwarder

They are clerics and paladins of Sune. You spread the teachings of Sune to every town and city you come to. You are at the forefront of any battle against the enemies of your Lady Firehair.

- **Classes.** Cleric (of Sune), Paladin (of Sune)

#### Sisters and Brothers of the Ruby Rose

This order's mission is twofold. You are tasked with guarding all of Sune's holy sites, from small shrines to city temples. In addition to this, you are tasked with hunting down the enemies of beauty and civilization. You often work with organizations such as the Order of the Gauntlet or the Lord's Alliance. To be initiated into the order, a prospective member must stand vigil for one night outside of a major temple of Sune. Members do not need to primarily worship Sune, but they are required to wear a symbol of her somewhere on their body.

- **Classes.** Barbarian, Bard, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger

#### Order of Adon

An order dedicated to the memory of Adon, a cleric of Sune that helped bring about the end to the Time of Troubles. While he turned his back on Sune during this tumultuous era in Faerûn's history, his actions allowed his former goddess to reclaim her divinity. Adon was friends with the mortal woman who would become the goddess Mystara, thus those who wield arcane magic often join the Order of Adon. In recognition of how an unbeliever such as Adon can benefit the Church of Sune, the Order is welcoming to those of other faiths.

- **Classes.** Artificers, Cleric (not of Sune), Druids, Sorcerers, Warlocks, Wizards

#### Eyes of Evening

An order inspired by the demigoddess of hedonism, Sharess, a divine servant of Sune. Sharess is also known as the mother of cats and is often worshipped by the tabaxi.

- **Classes.** Bards, Monks, Rogues

#### Allies

The Church of Sune works closely with the Order of the Gauntlet and the Lord's Alliance. Often, members of these organizations might work directly with the church.

### Church of Sune Enemies

The ugliness of [Baalzebul](/compendium/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-mabjov.md) is especially abhorrent to Sune. She hates that the archdevil was formerly Triel, one of the most beautiful angels to be found on Mount Celestia. The Church of Sune also despises Ssendam, as the Slaad lord's insanity and ugliness is a danger to the structure of the civilized world.

Sune supports efforts to vanquish powerful armies that threaten the stability of the civilized world. This includes orc hordes, hobgoblin empires, frost giant raiders, the Red Wizards of Thay, the Cult of the Dragon and other similar threats.

Sune also detests the ugliness of the undead, especially the rotting dead such as zombies, ghouls, mummies and liches.

## Emerald Enclave

An organization devoted to protecting the natural world, the Emerald Enclave allows those of any race or profession to join their ranks. The Emerald Enclave is opposed to everything that is unnatural and destructive toward nature. This includes elemental evil, the undead, demonic forces and abominations from the Far Realm.

While members are not opposed to civilization, they do strive to preserve a balance between nature and the civilized world. Often, the Emerald Enclave will come to the defense of a town or city when it comes under the threat of powerful elemental forces or otherworldly invaders.

The Emerald Enclave is very loosely organized, with small cells across the world. Individual members are encouraged to be self-reliant.

The beliefs of the Enclave are as follows:

- Seek out and destroy unnatural forces that threaten nature.

## Flaming Fist

The Flaming Fist is a powerful mercenary company based in the city of Baldur's Gate. They are the most famous mercenary company in Faerûn and many consider them the most powerful military force on the Sword Coast. Their leaders are primarily driven by the accumulation of wealth and glory. Some members have more altruistic motivations such as bringing peace to the cities and towns of the Sword Coast.

The Flaming Fist is Baldur's Gate's army and provides law enforcement to the city and the surrounding area. In addition, the Flaming Fist has forts and castles across the Sword Coast and even further in order to extend its power and reach. The Fist has established a presence in places as far as the jungles of Chult and the continents of Maztica, and Anchorome.

The Flaming Fist is run like an army. Every group of five fists is led by a manip and a flame. Manips are veteran soldiers who have risen through the ranks while flames are trained knights from a noble or mercantile family. A blaze is put in command of a fort or a mission. The marshal commands the entire Flaming Fist.

## Harpers

The Harpers are an old and influential organization of nobles, spellcasters and spies. They are secretive and most members have almost complete autonomy to operate how they want. Most Harpers work alone or in small groups. They freely share information between members, but rarely do they have coordinated strategies.

The purpose of the Harpers has always been to work against evil and tyranny. They believe in an individual's right to freedom and will often undermine regimes that are despotic or support slavery. While they focus on threats that originate in the world of Faerûn, they will intercede if an extraplanar evil begins to have undue influence upon the world. Harpers are also keen to keep ancient and powerful magic out of the hands of easily corruptible politicians.

Harpers are loved by the commonfolk, but often loathed by those in power. They can be seen as spies and manipulative liars who involve themselves where they aren't wanted. Much of this is true from a certain point of view. Harpers prefer to operate from the shadows, are not against lying to get what they want and often manipulate those in power to achieve their goals.

### Harper Operatives

#### Nobles

These Harpers were either born into or have inserted themselves into the corridors of power. They are priests, politicians, merchants, military commanders and other influential members of society. You must work hard to keep your identity as a Harper secret, as other nobility, even those that are not of evil bent, can view you as a traitor to your rank.

- **Classes.** Clerics, Fighters, Paladins

#### Spies

You are one of the infamous spies of the Harpers. You are feared by tyrants and evil organizations across the world due to your ability to strike anywhere at any time.

- **Classes.** Bards, Druids, Monks, Rangers, Rogues

#### Spellcasters

You focus on identifying magical artifacts or secrets that might fall into the hands of the easily corruptible.

- **Classes.** Artificers, Sorcerers, Warlocks, Wizards

### Harper Enemies

[Baalzebul](/compendium/bestiary/npc/baalzebul-mabjov.md), [Mephistopheles](/compendium/bestiary/npc/mephistopheles-mabjov.md) and other infernal lords are always viewed by the Harpers as a threat to Faerûn. This is because of the penchant for archdevils to corrupt those in power.

Anyone who were to come into possession of the [iron flask](/compendium/items/iron-flask.md) that contains [Pazuzu](/compendium/bestiary/npc/pazuzu-mabjov.md) would also be considered a great threat. Finally, the Zhentarim have always been a rival of the Harpers.

### Harper Quests

The Harpers are focused on undermining tyrants and evil organizations across all of Faerûn.

^random-quests-from-the-harpers

### Harper Perks

#### Safe Houses

The Harpers have secret members in almost every town and city. Your group knows how to locate these members and can use their houses to maintain a comfortable lifestyle. While the Harpers are famed for helping the poor, they rarely live like them.

#### Fences

Because the Harpers are devoted to tracking down magic items, they have a network with access to a larger variety of magical items than anywhere outside of the Red Wizards of Thay. Each member of your party gains access to certain magic items for a suitable donation. The different costs of acquiring these magic items are described in the table opposite.

## Knights of Bahamut

The Knights of Bahamut are an ancient order founded with the assistance of the elder draconic entity called Bahamut. They were famed for bonding with some of the most powerful and beautiful creatures in the multiverse—metallic dragons. Legends tell of how a single knight was capable of turning the tide of an entire battle or breaking the siege of a city. But the Knights of Bahamut were short lived, lasting only a few decades before being exterminated by their enemies. That was a thousand years ago.

The last surviving knight, a half-elf named Suldil, wishes to bring back the ancient Order. The Oath of Bahamut is the sacred rite that bonds a mortal and a dragon together. In order for the sacred rite to work, it must be blessed by Bahamut. Thus, the first task of the fledgling knight is to gain Bahamut's favor. After that, metallic dragon eggs must be found. They cannot be stolen from their parents. Only eggs that have not been stolen and whose parents are dead are considered viable.

> [!quote] Build a Group Patron

> Unlike the other Group Patrons in this book, the Knights of Bahamut doesn't exist yet as a functioning organization. It is the job of you and your party members to build the Knights of Bahamut into a powerful organization.

^random-quests-from-the-knights-of-bahamut

### Knights of Bahamut Perks

#### Expenses

Suldil has access to a great deal of wealth and is willing to reimburse you for expenses incurred as you try to rebuild the Knights of Bahamut. She pays for any nonmagical equipment and basic services that you require.

#### Luxury

Suldil allows you to stay at her estate for as long as you wish. While at her estate you maintain an aristocratic lifestyle for no cost.

#### Dragon Eggs

Suldil is willing to grant a dragon egg to someone that she feels is worthy. The recipient must exchange a magic item for the dragon egg.

**Dragon Eggs from Suldil**

| Dragon Egg | Required Level | Magic Item |
|------------|----------------|------------|
| Copper | 12 | Very Rare |
| Brass | 12 | Very Rare |
| Bronze | 14 | Very Rare |
| Silver | 16 | Legendary |
| Gold | 18 | Legendary |
^dragon-eggs-from-suldil

In order for a prospective knight to hatch their dragon egg, the egg must be kept in conditions that mirror the nest of its particular subtype of dragon:

- **Copper.** The egg must be coated in acid. This can be done with non-magical acid once a day, or by using spells such as acid splash once a day.
- **Brass.** The egg must be kept hot. Hot coals or a smithy's furnace work, as does using spells such as fire bolt.
- **Bronze.** The egg must be exposed to the sky for 12 hours a day or suffused with electricity once a day. The [shocking grasp](/compendium/spells/shocking-grasp.md) spell could be used.
- **Silver.** These eggs must be kept cool and dark. Packing an egg in ice or using a spell such as ray of frost once an hour, is sufficient.
- **Gold.** A gold egg must be kept hot, using the same methods as brass dragon eggs.

A typical dragon egg takes 3d6 weeks to hatch. When an egg is not looked after properly, there is a cumulative 10% chance per day that the egg will die. Once this happens, the egg will never hatch.

If a prospective knight wishes to bond with a dragon, they must be present at the hatching. When the newborn hatches, the knight must be the first living creature that it sees. The knight must then make the Oath of Bahamut.

The Oath of Bahamut is the sacred rite that bonds a mortal and a dragon together. During the hatching of the egg, the knight intones the oath. If a knight ever breaks the oath, the bond ends immediately. The oath must be intoned in the Draconic language, while a very rare or legendary magical item is sacrificed. The speaker does not need to know Draconic; they may be coached by someone who does.

While the Oath is being spoken, the energy from the magic item is drained and used to bind the knight to a newly-hatched wyrmling. The magic item becomes non-magical and loses its properties.

> [!quote]- A quote from Volo  
> 
> It is difficult to track down any writings on the Knights of Bahamut. They only existed for a brief time in the century when the nation of Amn was first founded and the Shoon Empire collapsed. The knights took the image of the platinum dragon as their emblem, but I do not know if they were actual servant of Bahamut.

## Order of Icarus

This order was founded by the undead siblings, Jon and [Bodhi Irenicus](/compendium/bestiary/npc/bodhi-irenicus-mabjov.md), and named after the elven house that they were born into. Its primary mission is to seek out magical secrets that will help Jon and Bodhi escape from their prison realm in the Shadowfell. They do this by searching the tombs of dead spellcasters and sages. Members of the Order of Icarus are sent to kill rival necromancers, liches and vampiric spellcasters. Members even kidnap powerful wizards and clerics (who worship gods of the Death domain).

Members are drawn from those trapped in the Shadowfell reflection of Suldanessellar. These are either travelers who have recently been lured to the Shadowfell or those who were born and grew up there.

#### Research

Whenever you or your group makes ability checks to research lore related to magic, undead or the Shadowfell you gain advantage.

#### Magical Item Transmutation

Over the centuries Jon has learned the secrets of transmuting many kinds of magic items. He is willing to share those secrets with those that he feels are worthy. The ritual takes a week to prepare for. To utilize the secret ritual, you require a magic item that is to be consumed in the ritual. You (or another member of your group) must make a successful [Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana) check to succeed. Whoever makes the [Arcana](/rules/skills.md#Arcana) check can be given assistance (and thus gain advantage on the roll) by someone who has a level in Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock or Wizard. The material component cost in gold represents the components needed. These components are consumed as well. A failed check means only the non-magical components are consumed, not the magic item. Another check can be made after the required week of preparation.

**Item Transmutation Components and Costs**

| Magic Item | Magical Component | Arcana Check DC | Material Component Cost |

## Raven Circle

The Raven Circle is a secret sect devoted to the enigmatic Raven Queen. The Raven Queen is a powerful entity that resides on the Shadowfell. She is obsessed with collecting memories associated with loss and tragedy.

One of the greatest secrets of the Raven Circle is their members ability to use the Shadowfell to travel the world. The Shadowfell is a dark reflection or "echo" of the Prime Material Plane. When first entering the Shadowfell, it appears very similar to the area of the world it reflects. However, for most, the further the Shadowfell is explored the more divergent from the Prime Material it will become. Soon the distorted nature of the plane makes it easy to become lost. Members of the Raven Circle are able to see through these distortions and can thus navigate the Shadowfell without losing their place in the Prime Material. This ability also means that the Circle often uses domains within the Shadowfell as bases of operations.

^random-quests-from-the-raven-circle

### Raven Circle Perks

#### Walk the Shadowfell

Any member of the Raven Circle can find paths in the Prime Material World that enter the Shadowfell. While traveling the Shadowfell, you don't have to worry about enemies in the Prime Material Plane finding you. You can also bypass barriers and dangerous monsters in the Prime Material. While you are skilled in avoiding the dangerous predators of the Shadowfell, you still risk discovery. You may use the paths of the Shadowfell once per month. When you enter the Shadowfell you can remain for as long as you want. You can return to the Prime Material at any point. Each day spent in the Shadowfell gives a cumulative 1 in 20 chance of coming under attack by one of the denizens of the Shadowfell. The kind of attack is up to your DM.

#### Collect Memories

The Raven Queen collects memories just like a raven collects trinkets. The Raven Queen only seeks the memories of powerful or influential entities, specifically those who have suffered great loss or tragedy. If you can give her the memories from these kinds of people, the Raven Queen will reward you. Collecting memories requires you to obtain an item that is precious to the person whose memories you wish to steal. You must then say a prayer to the Raven Queen with the item in hand and the owner in sight within 100 ft. This infuses the item with all of the target's memories of loss, shame and tragedy. When you give this item to one of your contacts ([Lothar](/compendium/bestiary/npc/lothar-mabjov.md) or [Viktor](/compendium/bestiary/npc/viktor-mabjov.md)) everyone in your group gains a devotion token that is either a feather, a gold coin or a gem (so long as the target associated with the item is still alive/undead). Each member of your group can only have one of each token at any given time and cannot give them to anyone else. The tokens you gain are as follows:

**Devotion Tokens**

| CR | Neutral | Chaotic | Lawful | Lycanthrope, Intelligent Undead*, Cursed** | Good, Used To Be Evil | Evil, Used To Be Good |
|----|---------|---------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| 5-9 | Feather | Feather | Feather | Gold Coin | Gold Coin | Gem |
| 10-12 | Feather | Feather | Feather | Gold Coin | Gold Coin | Gem |
| 13-15 | Feather | Feather | Feather | Gold Coin | Gem | Gem |
| 16-18 | Feather | Feather | Gold Coin | Gold Coin | Gem | Gem |
| 19+ | Feather | Feather | Gold Coin | Gem | Gem | Gem |
^devotion-tokens

#### Weapons of the Raven Queen

The Raven Queen is famed for using shadow magic to create weapons that are infused with the memories that she has collected over the millennia. The most famous weapon is [Blackrazor](/compendium/items/blackrazor.md), but there have been many others. All of these weapons are sentient and can only be used after their user attunes with them. You can call upon the Raven Queen to gift you such a weapon. For her to respond you must offer up a powerful magical weapon (rare, very rare or legendary) and the memories of a powerful tormented being (CR 5+ lycanthrope, intelligence undead, cursed, or a creature who has changed alignment). When you do this, you are granted a sentient weapon of your choice with a bonus as determined by the following chart:

**Raven Queen Sentient Weapon Bonuses**

| CR | Rare | Very Rare | Legendary |
|----|------|-----------|-----------|
| 5-9 | +1 | +1 | +2 |
| 10-15 | +2 | +2 | +3 |
| 16+ | +2 | +3 | +3 |
^raven-queen-sentient-weapon-bonuses

The sentient weapon has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. To determine them, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest. The weapon communicates by transmitting emotion to whoever is carrying or wielding it. Its alignment is the same as the memories of the being used in the offering to create it. You must name your weapon when you first use it.

Like all sentient weapons your sentient weapon can come into conflict with you if your goals are not aligned.

#### Sentient Weapon Powers

You can build up the power of your sentient weapon by spending your devotion tokens. See table below.

**Sentient Weapon Powers**

| Devotion Cost | Level Required | Power |
|---------------|----------------|-------|
| Feather token | 1 | The weapon can speak, read, and understand one language. This can be taken multiple times |
| Gold token | 3 | The weapon can communicate telepathically with any character that carries or wields it |
| Gem token | 3 | Roll on the Magic Item Minor Property table of the DMG. This can only be taken three times |
| Feather token | 3 | The weapon has hearing and normal vision out to 30 feet |
| Gold token | 5 | The weapon has hearing and normal vision out an additional 30 feet (to a maximum of 120 ft.) |
| Gold token | 7 | The weapon has [darkvision](/rules/senses.md#darkvision) (requires hearing and normal vision) |
| Gem token | 7 | The weapon has advantage on all [Perception](/rules/skills.md#Perception) checks |
| Feather token | 9 | One aspect of the weapon's alignment can be changed (good to evil, chaotic to lawful) |
| Gold token | 9 | The weapon scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 |
| Gem token | 12 | Roll once on the Artifact Minor Beneficial Properties table in the DMG. This can only be taken three times |

## Shadow Thieves

The Shadow Thieves are the most powerful thief's guild in Faerûn. While originally based in the city of Waterdeep, the guild is now headquartered in Athkatla. Unlike other guilds of its kind that remain local to a single city, the Shadow Thieves run criminal operations all along the Sword Coast. This also includes enclaves in a few cities within the Underdark. The Shadow Thieves are primarily concerned with the accumulation of wealth through whatever means necessary.

The Shadow Thieves engage in almost every form of criminal activity. This includes black mail, smuggling, piracy, burglary, illegal drugs. The only criminal activities that they avoid are prostitution and slavery.

### Shadow Thieves Operatives

#### Cloakmasters

You represent the will of the Shadow Council. You are responsible for running one or more of the criminal enterprises that the Shadow Thieves excel at—burglary, extortion, blackmail, bounty hunting, smuggling, piracy, racketeering, fencing, pick-pocketing or street begging.

- **Classes.** Bards, Monks, Rogues, Rangers

#### Silhouettes

You are an agent of the Shadow Thieves.

- **Classes.** Artificers, Bards, Clerics, Druids, Fighters, Paladins, Rogues, Sorcerers, Warlocks, Wizards

### Shadow Thieves Enemies

The Shadow Thieves hate the Lords of Waterdeep. They also despise the guild that replaced them in that city—Xanathar's Guild. Another enemy are the Zhentarim, a rival organization that engages in many of the same illegal activities.
