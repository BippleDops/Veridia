[[Sorrow-Root Nightbloom (D&D_References) has completed their fungal weapon designed to kill anyone exposed to crystal corruption. With 90% of Aethermoor's population having some crystal exposure, this represents genocide. The party must navigate the dangerous [The Synthesis Gardens|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Synthesis Gardens]], stop the weapon's deployment, and decide whether Sorrow-Root is villain or inadvertent savior. ## Quest Giver

**[[Archdruid Thornweaver|02 Worldbuilding/People/Archdruid Thornweaver** desperately seeks help after several of his druids were corrupted attempting to stop their former colleague. Alternatively, **[Sir Marcus Dawnforge|02 Worldbuilding/People/Sir Marcus Dawnforge]]** receives intelligence about the threat through his underground network. ## Background

Sorrow-Root's research has uncovered a terrible truth: the [[Aether Crystals aren't just corrupting magic stones - they're eggs of an extraplanar parasite. The Green Death might be the only way to stop a worse catastrophe, but at the cost of nearly everyone in Aethermoor. ### Primary Objectives

1. Infiltrate [The Synthesis Gardens|02 Worldbuilding/Places/The Synthesis Gardens]]
2. Stop or delay the Green Death deployment
3. Discover the truth about the crystal parasites
4. Make the impossible choice: genocide or potential extinction ### The Parasite Truth

Through Sorrow-Root's research notes, the party learns:
- Crystals are indeed eggs that will hatch in 2-3 years
- The parasites feed on life force and magic
- Each infected person becomes an incubator
- [[The Crimson Sage|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage (Aetheron) has been trying to prevent this ### Alternative Solutions

Hidden in the research:
- Batch 7-Alpha can reverse corruption if mass-produced
- [Goldspire Port|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Goldspire Port]]'s technology might destroy eggs
- The [[The Seven Shards|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seven Shards united might purge all corruption
- [Aquabyssos]] magic could transform people to survive ## DM Secrets

> [!warning] The Countdown

> - Deployment scheduled in 5 days
> - Each day, Sorrow-Root corrupts 1 square mile more of forest
> - Withered Court grows by 10 members daily
> - Confederate forces move closer to quarantine positions > [!danger] The Real Horror
> Sorrow-Root is RIGHT. The crystals will hatch, and the parasites will consume all life. The Green Death, horrible as it is, might be the only solution that saves any life on Aethermoor. > [!info] The Hidden Hope
> The secret garden with Sorrow-Root's last uncorrupted tree is the key to their humanity. If the tree is protected and shown that nature can survive without genocide, Sorrow-Root might relent. ## Player-Facing Summary The Green Death is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of The Green Death as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around The Green Death. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Someone is hunting information for money
