--- # Instrument of the Bards, Doss Lute

*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a bard)* ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/doss-lute.webp#right) An Instrument of the Bards is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take`2d4`Psychic damage. You can play the Doss [[flute-xphb (items)]] to cast one of the following spells: [[fly-xphb (spells)]], [[see-invisibility-xphb (spells)]], [[levitate-xphb (spells)]], [[Protection From Evil and Good Xphb]], [[Animal Friendship Xphb]], [[protection-from-energy-xphb (spells)]] (Fire damage only), and [[Protection From Poison Xphb]]. Once the Doss [[flute-xphb (items)]] has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide (2024) p. 272* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Instrument of the bards doss lute xdmg is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
