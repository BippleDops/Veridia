## Special Traits
**All-Around Vision:** A froghemoth's eyestalk allows it to scan quickly in all directions. Attackers never gain tactical advantage or bonus damage against it from the presence of nearby allies.

**Slowed by Electricity:** Although a froghemoth is immune to lightning damage, whenever it would otherwise take such damage, it is instead slowed for 1 round.

**Swallow:** A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained but no longer grappled. It takes 10 (`dice: 1d8+6`) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (`dice: 2d8`) acid damage automatically at the start of each of the froghemoth's turns. Any number of creatures can be inside the froghemoth at one time. A swallowed creature is unaffected by anything happening outside the froghemoth or by attacks from outside it. A swallowed creature can get out of the froghemoth by using 10 feet of movement, but only after the froghemoth is dead.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A froghemoth attacks once with its tongue and four times with tentacles. Each tentacle can either grab or crush. In addition to these attacks, it can also bite one creature it grapples.

**Tentacle Grab:** *Melee Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (`dice: 1d8+7`) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled.

**Tentacle Crush:** *Melee Attack:* automatic hit, one creature already grappled by a tentacle at the start of the froghemoth's turn. Hit: 12 (`dice: 1d10+7`) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled.

**Tongue:** *Melee Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 30 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (`dice: 1d6+7`) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled and restrained.

**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature grappled by the froghemoth's tentacles or tongue. Hit: 16 (`dice: 2d8+7`) piercing damage and the target must make a successful DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed (see above).

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate marsh

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
The froghemoth is a terrifying aberration that dwells in marshes and swamps. Its 30-foot-long tongue is agile and sticky, and it uses it to capture prey which it then swallows whole and digests alive. The froghemoth eats almost anything it can wrap its tongue or its tentacles around. Despite their size, froghemoths blend into their native swamps to a surprising degree, making them difficult to spot by people who haven’t encountered one before.

A froghemoth has no use for treasure, but a fair amount of it accumulates in the beast’s gut after the travelers and adventurers who carried it were digested. Many other useful items can be found around the creature’s territory, where they
