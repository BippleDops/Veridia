## Overview
Blood in the Water refers to both a literal phenomenon and a metaphorical concept in Aquabyssos. When violence spills blood into the city's waters, it triggers cascading effects throughout the underwater ecosystem and supernatural community. The phrase has become synonymous with escalating conflicts that threaten to spiral out of control.

## The Literal Effect
Actual blood in Aquabyssos's waters creates several immediate problems:
- **Predator Attraction:** Sharks, sea serpents, and worse creatures are drawn to the area
- **Magical Resoce:** Blood carries emotional imprints that affect nearby spellcasters
- **Territorial Disputes:** Marine life becomes aggressive and territorial
- **Corruption Spread:** In large amounts, blood can carry magical diseases
- **Scrying Interference:** Blood creates magical static disrupting divination

## Historical Incidents
**The Crimson Tide Massacre:** Political assassination that led to widespread violence
**Shark Week:** Seven-day period when predators overran the Harbor District
**The Blood Moon Ritual:** Cult sacrifice that summoned aberrant sea creatures
**Merchant War Spillover:** Trade dispute escalated to underwater naval battle

## Current Concerns
Recent Shadow Conspiracy violence has increased blood-spill incidents. Cleanup crews work overtime removing biological matter, while marine biologists track predator migration patterns. Religious orders perform purification rituals to cleanse corrupted water.

## Metaphorical Usage
"Blood in the water" describes situations where initial violence signals larger conflicts:
- Political rivalries turning deadly
- Gang wars escalating beyond control
- Diplomatic incidents threatening wider conflict

## Prevention Measures
**Rapid Response Teams:** Immediate cleanup and containment crews
**Predator Barriers:** Magical wards keeping dangerous creatures away
**Healing Stations:** Emergency medical facilities reducing bloodshed
**Peace Patrols:** Guards trained in conflict de-escalation
**Water Purification:** Ongoing magical cleaning of city water systems

## Adventure Hooks
1. Massive blood spill attracts dangerous deep-sea predators to city
