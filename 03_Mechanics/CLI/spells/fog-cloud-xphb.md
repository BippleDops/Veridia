# Fog Cloud
*1st-level, Conjuration*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You create a 20-foot-radius [Sphere](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) of fog centered on a point within range. The [Sphere](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) is [Heavily Obscured](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/heavily-obscured-xphb.md). It lasts for the duration or until a strong wind (such as one created by [Gust of Wind](/03_Mechanics/CLI/spells/gust-of-wind-xphb.md)) disperses it.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The fog's radius increases by 20 feet for each spell slot level above 1.

**Classes**: [Druid](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Ranger](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-ranger.md); [Cleric (Tempest Domain)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-tempest-domain.md "class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Bard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Druid (Circle of the Land)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-circle-of-the-land-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Druid (Circle of the Sea)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-circle-of-the-sea-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard (College of Lore)](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](/03_Mechanics/CLI/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
