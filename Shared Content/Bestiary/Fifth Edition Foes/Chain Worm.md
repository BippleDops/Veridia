## Special Traits
**Poison:** A creature poisoned by the chain worm must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, the creature takes 9 (`dice: 2d8`) poison damage and remains poisoned. On a successful save, the poisoned condition ends.

**Trilling:** By rapidly vibrating its carapace as a bonus action, a chain worm emits a high-pitched trilling sound that stuns and deafens creatures within range. All living creatures within 30 feet that can hear the trilling must make a successful a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or be stunned and deafened. Stunned characters can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns; a successful save ends the stunned condition, but the deafness lasts until the end of the creature's next long rest.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** The chain worm bites once and stings once with its tail.

**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 16 (`dice: 2d10+6`) piercing damage, and the target is grappled. While the chain worm maintains a grapple, it can only bite the grappled creature.

**Tail Sting:** *Melee Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 14 (`dice: 2d8+6`) piercing damage plus 9 (`dice: 2d8`) poison damage, and the target is poisoned (see above). This attack has tactical advantage against targets that are grappled by the chain worm.

## Description
Chain worms are terrifying subterranean predators with an insatiable appetite for meat. The creatures have a particular fondness for dwarf, gnome, and bugbear flesh. Chain worms often build their nests near communities of these creatures. Though not particularly fond of cold or damp weather, chain worms can be found almost anywhere, as their bulky, heavily armored exoskeletons offer ample protection against almost any environment.

A chain worm’s nest is a hole or tunnel littered with rocks, bones, refuse, and debris, and often located on a rocky outcropping or ledge where it is nearly inaccessible to most creatures. Any valuables found in its lair are simply the remains of previous meals that the chain worm couldn’t digest or didn’t bother eating.

Chain worms stand nearly 6 feet tall and are about 10 feet long, with silver carapaces and dull silver legs. Their heads sport oversized, dull black mandibles that constantly drip brownish-gray saliva.

A chain worm’s tail stinger is almost a foot long and jet black. As they age, their tail stingers fade to dull gray. A chain worm lies in wait for a meal, attacking whenever its target comes within range. Once it grabs a foe in its mandibles, it stings the victim repeatedly until the unfortunate creature dies.
