The quest for revenge sometimes leads those terribly aggrieved to undergo a ritual whereby they transform into bodies of semiliquid sentience known as slithering trackers. Innocuous and insidious at the same time, a slithering tracker flows into places where a normal creature can't go and brings its own brand of watery death down on its quarry.

The ritual for creating a slithering tracker is known to hags, liches, and priests who worship gods of vengeance. It can be performed only on a willing creature that hungers for revenge. The ritual sucks all the moisture from the subject's body, killing it. Yet the subject's mind lives on in the puddle that issues forth from the remains, and so too does its insatiable need for retribution.

A slithering tracker tastes the ground it courses over, seeking any trace of its prey. To kill, a slithering tracker rises up and enshrouds a creature, attempting to drown the creature while also draining it of blood.

Achieving revenge against its target doesn't end a slithering tracker's existence or its hunger for blood. Some slithering trackers remain aware of their purpose and extend their quest for vengeance to others, such as anyone who supported or befriended the original target. Most of the time, though, a tracker's mind can't cope with being trapped in liquid form, unable to communicate, and driven by the desire for blood; after fulfilling its duty, the overwhelmed creature attacks indiscriminately until it is destroyed.
