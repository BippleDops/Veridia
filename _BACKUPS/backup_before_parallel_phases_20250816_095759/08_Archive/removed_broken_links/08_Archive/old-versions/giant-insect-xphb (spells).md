*4th-level, Conjuration* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes You summon a giant centipede, spider, or wasp (chosen when you cast the spell). It manifests in an unoccupied space you can see within range and uses the [[giant stat block. The form you choose determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 [hit-points-xphb (variant-rules)]] or when the spell ends. The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your [[Initiative Xphb count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [actions#Dodge|Dodge]] action and uses its movement to avoid danger. **Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block. **Classes**: [[classes; [classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 279.

Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of giant insect xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around giant insect xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Alliance - Achieve immortality ## Prophecy Connection Mentioned in The First Prophecy of Stars ## Plot Hooks - Strange disappearances suggest ancient magic
