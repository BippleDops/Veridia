# Scroll of Titan Summoning (Kraken)
*Scroll, legendary*  



When you take a [Magic](/03_Mechanics/CLI/actions.md#Magic) action to read this scroll, a [Kraken](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/kraken-xmm.md) appears in an unoccupied space in water that you can see within 1 mile of yourself. A [kraken](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/kraken-xmm.md) requires a body of water large enough to contain it, or the summoning fails and the scroll is wasted

The [Kraken](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/kraken-xmm.md) is [Hostile](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hostile-attitude-xphb.md) toward all other creatures and disappears when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). If the [Kraken](/03_Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/kraken-xmm.md) is summoned into a space that isn't large enough to contain it, the summoning fails, and the scroll is wasted.
