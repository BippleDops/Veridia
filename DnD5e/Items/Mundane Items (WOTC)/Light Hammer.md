# Light Hammer
**Type**: Mundane Item
**Group**: weapon, simple weapon, melee weapon
**Properties**: 1d4, bludgeoning, - light, thrown (20/60 ft.)
**Weight**: 2 lb.
**Value**: 2 gp
## Description: 
 Light. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons. Thrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.
