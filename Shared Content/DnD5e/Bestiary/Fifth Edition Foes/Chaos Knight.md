## Special Traits

**Icy Incorporeality:** By using an action, a chaos knight can make itself incorporeal until the start of its next turn. While incorporeal, it can pass through solid objects such as a wall, or other creatures, as if they were difficult terrain. It leaves behind an icy outline where it passes.

**Spell-like Abilities:** The chaos knight can use the following spell-like abilities, using Charisma as its casting ability (DC 13, attack +5). The chaos knight doesn’t need material components to use these abilities.

- At-Will: *chill touch, ray of frost*

- 3/day: *dimension door, protection from good*

- 2/day: *ice storm*

- 1/day: *telekinesis, wall of ice*

## Actions

**Multiattack:** The chaos knight attacks twice with its greatsword.

**Greatsword:** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 11 (`dice: 2d6+4`) slashing damage plus `dice: 1d6` cold damage.

## Ecology

**Environment**: Temperate

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description

No features can be discerned within a chaos knight’s helm, save for a dim blue glow. Although the creature seems insubstantial, a chaos knight has a real physical presence. Intense cold radiates from its being; any fire within 20 feet sputters, struggles to remain lit, and gives off no noticeable heat. Liquids in that radius turn cold and quickly freeze.

The chaos knight’s dimension door portal appears as a kaleidoscopic passage of jagged energy bolts and whirling, ever-changing elemental matter. Any being other than the Chaos Knight that passes through the portal suffers 10 points of cold damage.
