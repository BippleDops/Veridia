## Special Traits
***Devil's Sight.*** Magical darkness doesn't impede the abishai's darkvision.

***Magic Resistance.*** The abishai has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** The abishai's weapon attacks are magical.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The abishai can use its Frightful Presence. It also makes three attacks: one with its morningstar, one with its claw, and one with its bite.

***Morningstar.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ( `dice: 1d8+6`) piercing damage.

***Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 17 ( `dice: 2d10+6`) slashing damage.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack:  +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 ( `dice: 5d10+6`) piercing damage plus 38 ( `dice: 7d10`) fire damage.

***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the abishai's choice that is within 120 feet and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the abishai's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

***Incite Fanaticism.*** The abishai chooses up to four of its allies within 60 feet of it that can see it. For 1 minute, each of those allies makes attack rolls with advantage and can't be frightened.

***Power of the Dragon Queen.*** The abishai targets one dragon it can see within 120 feet of it. The dragon must make a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. A chromatic dragon makes this save with disadvantage. On a successful save, the target is immune to the abishai's Power of the Dragon Queen for 1 hour. On a failed save, the target is charmed by the abishai for 1 hour. While charmed in this way, the target regards the abishai as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. This effect ends if the abishai or its companions deal damage to the target.

## Description
Red abishais have no equals among the abishais when it comes to leadership ability and raw power. They can invoke Tiamat's authority to bend even dragons to their will. Red abishais lead other devils into battle or take charge of troublesome cults to ensure that they continue to carry out Tiamat's commands. A red abishai cuts a fearsome figure, and that sight can be inspiring to the abishai's allies, filling them with a fanatical willingness to fight.
