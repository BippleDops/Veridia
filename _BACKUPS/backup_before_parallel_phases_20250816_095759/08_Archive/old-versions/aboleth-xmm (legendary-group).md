_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_ The region containing an aboleth's lair is warped by it, creating the following effects: - **Foul Water.** Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are supernaturally fouled. Creatures other than the aboleth and its allies that drink such water must succeed on a **DC 15** Constitution saving throw or have the [[conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned condition for 1 hour. - **Psionic Projection.** While in its lair, the aboleth can cast [Project Image Xphb]], requiring no spell components and using Intelligence as the spellcasting ability (spell save **DC 16**). When casting the spell this way, the spell's range is 1 mile, and the aboleth can use its telepathy as if it were in the illusion's space. If the aboleth dies or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. ## Player-Facing Summary Aboleth xmm is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of aboleth xmm as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around aboleth xmm. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Covenant - Control trade routes ## Plot Hooks - Someone is blackmailing a witness for revenge
