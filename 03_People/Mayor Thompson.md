## Overview
Mayor Bartholomew Thompson is a portly, gregarious man who exemplifies the corruption that festers in Aquabyssos's outer districts. Once a successful surface merchant who fled to the depths to escape gambling debts, Thompson has rebuilt his fortune through a combination of legitimate trade and criminal enterprise. His jovial exterior masks a calculating mind that treats politics as just another business transaction.

## Physical Description
Standing 5'8" with a rotund belly that strains against expensive silk vests, Thompson has the appearance of a man who enjoys life's finer pleasures. His salt-and-pepper beard is meticulously groomed, and his thinning hair is always slicked back with expensive oils. His most distinctive feature is his collection of gaudy gold teeth, installed to replace ones lost in various "business negotiations."

Thompson's clothing is a deliberate display of wealth—fine silks in deep blues and greens, gold-threaded embroidery, and more jewelry than is strictly tasteful. He carries himself with the swagger of a successful merchant, always ready with a hearty laugh and a firm handshake.

## Background
Bartholomew Thompson arrived in Aquabyssos fifteen years ago as a desperate man fleeing surface debts. He quickly realized that the underwater city's complex bureaucracy and distant imperial oversight created perfect opportunities for creative business practices. Starting with a small import business, he gradually expanded into smuggling, bribery, and eventually politics.

His rise to mayor wasn't through popular vote but through strategic bribes, blackmail, and the mysterious disappearance of his primary rival. He's transformed Drift Harbor from a struggling working-class district into a thriving (if morally questionable) commercial hub.

## Special Abilities

**Political Immunity.** Thompson has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or intimidated by creatures of lower social standing. Government officials must succeed on a **DC 16** Charisma save to take hostile action against him without evidence of wrongdoing.

**Merchant's Eye.** Thompson can assess the value of any object or service with perfect accuracy. He automatically knows if someone is lying about prices, quality, or availability.

**Criminal Network.** Thompson can call upon his network of smugglers, thieves, and corrupt officials. This functions as a *sending* spell to any criminal contact within 500 miles, usable 3 times per day.

**Escape Plan.** Thompson always has an exit strategy. Once per day, he can cast *misty step* as a bonus action, representing his use of hidden passages and prepared escape routes.

## Actions

**Multiattack.** Thompson makes two attacks with his Silverfish Stiletto or uses a cantrip and makes one weapon attack.

**Silverfish Stiletto.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (`dice: `dice: 1d4`` + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (`dice: `dice: 2d6``) poison damage. The target must succeed on a **DC 14** Constitution save or be poisoned for 1 minute.

**Corrupt Influence (3/Day).** Thompson offers a bribe or threatens consequences. One creature within 30 feet must succeed on a **DC 15** Wisdom save or be charmed for 1 hour, during which they are inclined to help Thompson with reasonable requests.

**Call for Backup (1/Day).** Thompson summons `dice: `dice: 1d4`` Thugs (his bodyguards/enforcers) who arrive in `dice: `dice: 1d4`` rounds. These thugs are equipped with nets and clubs, specializing in subduing rather than killing.

## Voice & Mannerisms

**Voice**: Soft and measured

**Speech Pattern**: Peppered with idioms

**Physical Habits**: Remains perfectly still

### Hidden Truths (DM Only)
> [!warning] DM Secrets
> - **The Murder Contract**: Thompson hired [[Shadow Parliament]] assassins to kill the previous mayor, paying them with stolen imperial artifacts
> - **Surface Debts**: His original gambling debts are still outstanding, and surface creditors are beginning to track him down
> - **The Daughter's Leverage**: His estranged daughter Melody has evidence of his crimes and is deciding whether to expose him
> - **Imperial Spy**: He's been secretly feeding information to Aethermoor agents about Aquabyssos military movements
> - **The Succession Plan**: Thompson is poisoning the current district governor to create a power vacancy he can fill
> - **Secret Addiction**: He's become dependent on a rare deep-sea drug that grants temporary water-breathing to surface dwellers

### Primary Motivations
1. **Power**: Expand his political influence beyond the district level
2. **Wealth**: Amass enough fortune to buy his way into the noble class
3. **Security**: Eliminate threats to his empire before they can destroy him
4. **Legacy**: Convince his daughter to join his business and continue his work

## Combat Tactics
Thompson is not a warrior and avoids direct confrontation whenever possible. His preferred strategies include:

- **Negotiation First**: Always tries to buy, bribe, or threaten his way out of trouble
- **Human Shields**: Uses innocent bystanders and his own corrupt officials as cover
- **Escape Artist**: Activates hidden doors, calls for backup, and uses magic items to flee
- **Dirty Fighting**: Throws sand (or silt), uses poison, and exploits environmental hazards
- **Last Resort**: If cornered, he'll offer valuable information or reveal embarrassing secrets about opponents

## Adventure Hooks

1. **The Missing Mayor** - Thompson has disappeared, and both his criminal empire and legitimate government are in chaos. Is he dead, kidnapped, or has he fled with the district treasury?

2. **The Corruption Investigation** - Imperial investigators are closing in on Thompson's crimes. He offers the party a fortune to eliminate evidence and witnesses before he's arrested.

3. **The Daughter's Dilemma** - Thompson's surface-dwelling daughter arrives with evidence that could destroy him. She needs protection from his assassins while deciding whether to expose her father.

4. **The Smuggler's War** - A rival smuggling operation is muscling in on Thompson's territory. He hires the party to eliminate the competition, but they discover the rivals are actually trying to expose his slavery operations.

5. **The Blackmail Gambit** - Thompson has compromising information about one of the party members and demands they perform illegal services for him. Can they turn the tables and expose his corruption instead?

6. **The Poisoned Politician** - Someone is trying to assassinate Thompson using the same methods he used on his predecessor. The party must protect him while investigating who knows his secrets.

7. **The Underground Railroad** - Thompson's slavery operation is being sabotaged by an underground resistance. The party becomes involved and must choose between profit and morality.

8. **The Surface Creditors** - Thompson's original gambling debts catch up with him when surface-world enforcers arrive in Aquabyssos. The party becomes caught between two criminal organizations.

### Personality in Action
**Voice**: Loud, jovial, with a surface accent he tries to hide when talking to nobility. Frequently interrupts himself with hearty laughs and uses merchant cant when discussing business.

**Mannerisms**:
- Constantly adjusts his gold tooth with his tongue when nervous
- Rubs his hands together when discussing profitable deals
- Slaps people on the back and offers drinks to everyone
- His smile never reaches his eyes when he's being genuinely friendly

## Thompson's District: Drift Harbor

Under Thompson's leadership, Drift Harbor has become a study in contrasts:

**Public Face**:
- Thriving commercial district with bustling markets
- New civic improvements and public works projects
- Regular cultural festivals that boost tourism
- Efficient government services (for those who can pay)

**Hidden Reality**:
- Widespread corruption in all levels of government
- Organized crime operating with official protection
- Slavery and human trafficking disguised as "employment services"
- Environmental destruction ignored in favor of profitable ventures

## Plot Threads
Thompson serves as an excellent example of corruption at the local level and can be involved in numerous plot threads:
- Political corruption exposé campaigns
- Crime family wars and territory disputes
- Moral dilemmas about working with corrupt but effective leaders
- Investigations into government crime and conspiracy
- Stories about redemption versus justice
- Economic warfare between legitimate and criminal enterprises

His character represents the theme that evil often wears a friendly face and that corruption can make even beneficial changes morally questionable. He's simultaneously an effective leader who's improved his district and a criminal who's destroyed lives for profit.
