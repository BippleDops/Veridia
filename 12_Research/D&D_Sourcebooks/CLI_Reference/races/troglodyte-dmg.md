## Traits

### Chameleon Skin

You have advantage on Dexterity ([[skills#Stealth|Stealth]]) checks made to hide.

### Stench

Any creature other than a troglodyte that starts its turn within 5 ft. of you must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be [[conditions#Poisoned|poisoned]] until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the stench of all troglodytes for 1 hour.

While in sunlight, you have disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom ([[skills#Perception|Perception]]) checks that rely on sight.

### Natural Armor

Your thick hide grants you a +1 bonus to Armor Class.

### Darkvision

You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

### Languages

You can speak, read, and write Troglodyte.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties troglodyte dmg to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
