# Trap #23 - ''It Is Always Darkest Before Things Go Right Down The Drain!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

The best thing about the last trap is that in the space of 50 to I 00 feet you can have 2 to 5 of them. By the time what's left of the party has drifted out of the tunnel they will need a rest. And the always generous Evinrood is glad to oblige. The room the party has drifted into is 50 feet in all directions, up, down and side to side. Furthermore it has an inhibitory spell on it that works as follows. Any of the lower life fonns that drift into the chamber, like barricudas, albino sharks, wandering lawfers and such will 􀃖ot be able to sense the presence of food. If the party can manage to obtain light they wilJ be gble to see that the water is quite deep, and crystal clear. The frightful denizens are clearly seen all about the delving party, moving on into the next part of the river. (Descriptions in d􀃗tail of what they have been struggling against would be an excellent use of terror at this point! Gives lhe party something to look forward to.)

Also to be seen is a great chain that is in the center of the room. It is anchored to the ceiling, and descends into the depths of the pool, where it is also anchored to a round dwarf carved and positioned stone slab. Near the chain at the top can be seen a glittering that is near and dear to the heart of any dungeon delver and tomb trespasser: crystaline formations. These are so clearly gem quality it can be seen from the river surface 50 feet away. It is as if the grotto had been eaten away from below by the river until it came to this layer of uncut gems.

Up to this point the only things of value salvageable by the party have been fine dwarvish stainless cutlery (1,000- 1,750 g.p. value each. Hey didn't I tell you Evinrood had a government sized budget on this place.) The delvers have been battered, beaten, sliced, spiked and nibbled; if they don't go for this bait check them for signs of brain damage.

The chain is easy to climb for there is no slack to it. The delvers should all be able to fit on the chain as it is 50 feet in length from the water to the ceiling. When the first delver reaches the top of the chain he will see a ruby the size of his head nestled amongst similar stones that are packed together in a bed of shale. Or so it will seem. When the party starts to loosen the stones around the ruby, or tries to take the ruby itself they will seal their own fate.

The Ruby is attached to the mechanism that holds the chain in place in the ceiling. The chain in tum holds the plug in the bottom of the room in place. Things start happening fast at this point. Number one, the chain shoots straight into the water below like an arrow. The partial vacuum imparted in times long past to the large chamber under this one will suck the block to which the chain is fastened into the chamber below like an egg into a bottle. (You know, milk bottle, lighted match, egg on the opening-t hoop-into the bottle? Arg! What's happened to young trapsters these days? Don't any of you watch "Mr. Science"?)

Any delvers who do not let go should have a 60% chance (I.A) of surviving being sucked through a hole under water at high speed. U any members of the party survive there is a 30% chance they will be stunned by the 100 foot fall to the chamber botiom. This will cause them to drown unless rescued from the following events. The party will then be hit by the torrent of water from above with the power of a highspeed fire hose! (There is an 80% chance (L2) to avoid being directly below the opening and battered by the stream!)

Tomb robbers lucky enough to have been in the water still, or to have let go in time are now treated to a merry-go-round ride the likes of which they have never experienced. Like a giant tub emptied by an extra large drain the circular chamber has become a vortex! The suction, combined with the speed of the current has started a whirlpool effect that will begin to fill the vast chamber under the pool. The delvers will be powerless to resist.

Those that can fly out of the water will be knocked out of the air by falling rocks from the ceiling above. The mechanism holding the top of the chain in place also serves to start a "cave in" of the gem bearing slate layer. This was designed to peal off just the l foot thick layer that was "plastered" onto u'ie roof, especially with flying wizards in mind.

If a member of the group survives being pulled into the lower chamber keep in mind that it will fill up in fairly short order having as it's source of supply the entire river system, and that this will leave the party under 50 feet of water once the incoming pressure equalizes. To add insult to injury the gems themselves, having been washed out of the falling rock will be sucked down into the bottom of the lower chamber. Oh yes, there is more: the "no lunch" spell is only good in the upper chamber. All the denizens that are swept into the lower chamber to keep the delvers company will be in full fighting trim. Salvaging the jewels should pose a daunting prospect 100 feet from the surface of the pool, through a fairly narrow opening, past the hungry river dwellers, without any light, should keep them out, but the prospect of 10,000 g.p. (uncut, as is) will prove a powerful temptation.

Oh one last thing, being pulled through the "drain hole" will be none too good for the structure of the party's boat, or boats! Let's face it, those old wooden boats will be irrecoverable. So don't Jet any wise-guy members of the party tell you otherwise. All right! If someone in the group has the right magical ability they MIGHT be able to put the boats back togather again with the right spell. Sheesh!

This trap rates four skulls: with so many ways to go this one is almost a sure thing.
