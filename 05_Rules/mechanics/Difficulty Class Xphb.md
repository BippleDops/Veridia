--- # Difficulty Class

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 366. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* A Difficulty Class (DC) is the target number for an ability check or a [[Death Saving Throw Xphb]]. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Difficulty class xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of difficulty class xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around difficulty class xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - Strange disappearances suggest ancient magic

- A shipment has gone missing and truth emerges
- A stranger needs help delivering before the new moon
- A shipment has gone missing and war looms ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
