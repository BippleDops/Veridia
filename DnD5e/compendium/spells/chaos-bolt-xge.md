# Chaos Bolt
*1st-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.

**Chaos Bolt**

| dice: d8 | Damage Type |
|----------|-------------|
|  | Acid |
|  | Cold |
|  | Fire |
|  | Force |
|  | Lightning |
|  | Poison |
|  | Psychic |
|  | Thunder |
^chaos-bolt

If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.

A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

**Classes**: Sorcerer
