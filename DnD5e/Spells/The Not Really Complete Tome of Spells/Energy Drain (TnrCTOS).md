# Energy Drain (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *9th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (a pinch of dust from a slain vampire)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You open a channel between the place where you stand and the Negative Plane, using yourself as a conduit. You must then touch another living creature. That creature permanently has its Strength and Constitution permanently reduced by 1d4 each and takes 6d10 necrotic damage. If this brings that creature to 0 hit points, it dies and rises as a specter in 1d4 hours.

Each time you cast this spell, you must roll 1d20. If you roll a 1, your connection to the Negative Plane is too strong and you lose the same amount of Strength, Constitution, and hit points.
