## Special Traits
**Olive Slime Defenses:** The armor class and hit points listed above are for a Large patch of olive slime in its native environment. Olive slime on a victim has the victim's AC and hit points equal to the number of Constitution points the victim has lost.

**Olive Slime Infestation:** Any amount of olive slime that remains in contact with a potential victim for more than two minutes charms the victim and alters his or her thinking patterns so that the host's main concern becomes feeding and protecting the olive slime"including keeping the slime hidden from companions. If anyone tries to remove the olive slime from the host, the host does whatever is required to protect the slime, whether it's running away or fighting back. As long as the host is alive and conscious, it will do everything in its power to protect the slime, including knocking out or even killing its friends. An infested creature suffers the following effects.

## Actions
**Drop:** *Melee Attack:* +3 to hit, reach 30 ft., one creature beneath the olive slime. Hit: target creature must make a successful DC 15 Wisdom saving throw to notice the olive slime that dripped onto it. If the olive slime is noticed and removed immediately, it has no effect. If the olive slime is not noticed and removed within two minutes, the creature loses 1 point of Constitution and is infested with olive slime; see above.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Underground

**Organization**: Solitary or colony (2–5)

## Description
Olive slime is a fungal growth that thrives in dark, damp, underground areas. It is sticky, gloppy, and drab green in color. It grows across ceilings, floors, and walls, waiting for live prey to pass nearby. Olive slime detects vibrations and drops gobs the size of a chicken egg from ceilings and walls when it detects movement beneath it, or oozes up the sides and over the tops of boots and shoes that step in it. Once on a victim, the gob of slime oozes through gaps in armor and clothes until it contacts skin, where it immediately secretes a numbing poison to hide its presence from its new host. As time goes by, the olive slime slowly digests the victim’s body, replacing its flesh and organs with olive slime, until the victim is entirely transformed into an [[Olive Slime Zombie|olive slime zombie]].

The slime instinctively seeks a patch of flesh that’s hidden from view to begin its work of transformation: the small of the back and the armpit are favorite spots. Unless the victim strips to bathe, other characters aren’t likely to notice the infestation—at least, not right away.

The GM should keep track of the victim’s Constitution loss. Other characters can notice the change taking place in their companion with passive Perception. The DC for noticing the creeping transformation is 8 plus the number of Constitution points the victim has left. For example, if an infested character has been reduced to Con 7, characters with passive Perception 15 notice the olive slime growing across his or her skin; when the character’s Con drops to 3, the condition can be noticed by characters with passive Perception 11.
