## Overview
The Storm Caller Druid represents the primal connection between [[Aethermoor]] and the elemental forces of air, storm, and sky. These druids have learned to channel the raw power of tempests, commanding wind and lightning to protect the aerial realms and maintain the balance between civilization and the wild fury of storms. They serve as weather guardians, sky shepherds, and harbingers of nature's wrath.

## Core Concept
Storm Callers are druids who specialize in weather magic and aerial combat, drawing their power from the endless storms that rage through Aethermoor's upper atmosphere. They can summon tempests, ride lightning bolts, and communicate with storm spirits. Many serve as navigators for skyships, weather predictors for agricultural communities, or guardians of sacred storm sites.

## Cultural Background
Storm Callers are revered and feared in equal measure throughout Aethermoor. They serve as essential weather predictors for agricultural communities, navigators for skyship crews, and guardians against dangerous atmospheric phenomena. Their deep connection to storm spirits and elemental forces makes them bridges between civilization and the wild power of the sky.

## Progression Notes
