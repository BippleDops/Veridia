### Holy Symbol (Pic)

## Description
Most every faith has its symbol of divinity, a physical reminder of a power that transcends the physical. These symbols are critical to most priest spells, and undead of all sorts recognize their power when presented by a believing hand.

The following holy symbols, though of fine craftsmanship, are neither blessed nor authorized by the corresponding church. Even so, those church officials who have contacted us have expressed only appreciation for making their symbols available among the people. All our holy symbols come in 8 ounce gold (10 gp), silver (4 gp), or bronze (1 gp) sizes that attach easily to garments or may be hand-held for presentation. Specify faith when ordering.

## Additional Details
Must be blessed by church for spell-use/ turning
