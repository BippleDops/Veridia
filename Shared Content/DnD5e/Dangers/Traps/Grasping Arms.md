# Grasping Arms
## Overview
*Magical trap*
This trap appears in 10-foot wide and smaller corridors. Stone arms are carved into the walls. A character notices subtle movement in the arms with a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check. Creatures wearing a special amulet designed by the trap's maker can move through the corridor without triggering the trap.

When a creature has moved to the center of the corridor, the trap is triggered. At the start of the round the arms make attack rolls with a +5 bonus, grasping at all creatures adjacent to the walls of the corridor. A successful attack deals 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage to a creature and it is grappled by the arms (escape DC 14). While grappled in this way the creature is also restrained.

Dealing 10 damage to the arms grasping a creature with a single attack or spell causes the arms to let go of that creature (AC 17).
