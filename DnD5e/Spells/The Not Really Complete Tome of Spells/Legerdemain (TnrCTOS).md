# Legerdemain (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *cantrip*

**School**: *Conjuration*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 10 feet

**Components**: V, S

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You perform a magic trick, of the sort normally performed by stage magicians.

♦ You can change a Tiny creature or object into another one.

♦ You can hide an object or creature of up to Huge size by moving a curtain in front of it, by having it move behind an object, or otherwise briefly obscuring it for a moment. This only hides the target from vision; the target can still be heard, smelled, etc.

♦ You can hide a Tiny object or creature in your palm, up your sleeve, in your hat, etc., hiding any bulges or sounds it makes, while creating an illusory duplicate of it that lasts for three rounds.

♦ You can cause any Tiny object that is within 5 feet of you to appear in your hand.

♦ You conjure harmless mouse, song-bird, butterfly, or other such creature—the creature is actually taken from somewhere in a 1-mile radius. Because this is a real crea-ture, this version of *legerdemain* is permanent; you may choose to send it back at the end of the spell’s duration.

♦ You create a puff of colored smoke. It provides light concealment for up to 2 rounds.
