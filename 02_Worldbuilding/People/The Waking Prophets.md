# The Waking Prophets

*"Sleep is death's rehearsal - we practice eternal vigilance." - Prophet Insomnia*

## Overview
The Waking Prophets believe that sleep is a curse that separates consciousness from divine truth. This ascetic order practices extreme sleep deprivation, claiming that exhaustion-induced visions reveal authentic prophecy. Members undergo rigorous training to function without sleep while maintaining prophetic clarity.

## Core Beliefs
- Sleep clouds the mind and blocks divine communication
- True prophecy comes through sustained wakefulness
- Dreams are lies told by malevolent entities
- The "Great Awakening" will free all minds from sleep's tyranny
- Consciousness is humanity's highest achievement

## Practices and Rituals
**The Vigil:** New members stay awake for 72 consecutive hours
**Stimulant Ceremonies:** Consumption of magical alertness enhancers
**Prophecy Sessions:** Group meditation during extreme exhaustion
**Sleep Denial:** Advanced members sleep only 1-2 hours per week
**Vision Recording:** Detailed documentation of exhaustion-induced revelations

## Hierarchy
**The Sleepless One:** Leader who hasn't slept in over five years
**Senior Prophets:** Members maintaining wakefulness for months
**Vision Keepers:** Specialists recording and interpreting prophecies
**Initiates:** New members learning sleep denial techniques
**The Fallen:** Former members who succumbed to sleep

## Prophectic Accuracy
The group has achieved notable success in predicting events, though critics argue their methods cause more hallucinations than genuine visions. Supporters point to several accurate predictions about political upheavals and natural disasters.

## Physical Effects
**Enhanced Perception:** Extreme alertness to environmental details
**Emotional Volatility:** Rapid mood swings and intense reactions
**Physical Deterioration:** Health problems from chronic exhaustion
**Psychic Sensitivity:** Increased magical and supernatural awareness

**Religious Orders:** View practices as heretical extremism
**Family Members:** Seek help for relatives involved
**Government Health Officials:** Consider intervention measures

## Resources
**Sacred Stimulants:** Magical substances preventing sleep
**Prophecy Archives:** Records of visions and interpretations
**Training Facilities:** Centers for sleep denial education
**Financial Support:** Donations from believers and clients
**Underground Network:** Safe houses for avoiding authorities
