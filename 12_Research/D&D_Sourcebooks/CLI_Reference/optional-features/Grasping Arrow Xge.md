--- # Grasping Arrow

*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 29* When this arrow strikes its target, conjuration magic creates grasping, poisonous brambles, which wrap around the target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra`2d6`poison damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes`2d6`slashing damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. The target or any creature that can reach it can use its action to remove the brambles with a successful Strength ([[skills#Athletics|Athletics]]) check against your Arcane Shot save DC. Otherwise, the brambles last for 1 minute or until you use this option again. The poison damage and slashing damage both increase to`4d6`when you reach 18th level in this class. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Grasping arrow xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
