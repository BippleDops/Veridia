*The Floating Towers of Magical Learning* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview Suspended high above [[Crystalhaven|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven]] on crystally-powered levitation platforms, Arcanum Heights represents the pinnacle of magical achievement in [[Aethermoor|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]]. This district of floating towers, aerial bridges, and gravity-defying gardens serves as the premier magical research and education center for the surface world, rivaling even the infamous [[Abyssal Academy|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/Abyssal Academy]] in the depths of [[Aquabyssos]]. The Heights house the most advanced magical practitioners, dangerous experimental facilities, and the largest collection of pre-[[The Great Drowning|02 Worldbuilding/Lore/The Great Drowning]] magical knowledge remaining on the surface. Here, crystal-powered enchantments push the boundaries of what many consider possible, creating both wonders and catastrophes in equal measure. ### The Floating Towers

Seven major towers hover at different altitudes above Crystalhaven, each dedicated to a school of magical study: **The Evocation Spire** - Highest tower, dealing with dangerous energy magic
**The Transmutation Cylinder** - Constantly shifting shape and materials
**The Enchantment Dome** - Spherical structure with mind-affecting protections
**The Conjuration Platform** - Open-air facility for summoning research
**The Divination Needle** - Impossibly thin tower reaching toward the stars
**The Necromancy Vault** - Heavily shielded underground facility (technically part of Heights district)
**The Abjuration Fortress** - Central defensive structure protecting all others ### Connecting Infrastructure

**Crystal Bridges**: Solid light constructs linking towers, requiring magical authorization to cross
