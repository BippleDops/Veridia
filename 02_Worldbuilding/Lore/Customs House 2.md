# Customs House
*Gateway Between Worlds*

## Overview

The Customs House stands as one of the most unusual and important buildings in either world—a facility that exists simultaneously in both [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor and [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]], serving as the primary checkpoint for the growing trade between realities. Located at a stable [[02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Merged Reality Zones, this imposing structure facilitates legal commerce while serving as the front line against interdimensional smuggling, illegal immigration, and the spread of dangerous artifacts.

Originally built as separate facilities on both sides of a dimensional weak point, the buildings gradually merged as reality barriers weakened, creating a unique architectural marvel where crystal spires extend underwater while coral formations grow in open air. The Customs House has become a symbol of cooperation between worlds, even as political tensions rise and [02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Convergence Point]] approaches.

## Physical Description
