## Overview
The enigmatic envoy from the Tidal Courts of Aquabyssos, a vast underwater empire thought lost to legend. Nerida arrived in [[Crystalhaven|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Crystalhaven]] six months ago, claiming to represent the "Drowned Parliament"—a coalition of submerged civilizations that have thrived beneath the waves for centuries.

## Abilities & Stats
**AC:** 16 (Deep Magic Ward)
**HP:** 88 (11d8 + 33)
**Speed:** 30 ft., swim 60 ft.

**STR:** 12 (+1) **DEX:** 16 (+3) **CON:** 16 (+3)
**INT:** 18 (+4) **WIS:** 15 (+2) **CHA:** 20 (+5)

## Secrets
> [!warning] DM Only
> - Actually serves the Leviathan Council, not just the Drowned Parliament
> - Knows that three of the Seven Shards originated from Aquabyssos temples
> - Has been marking key surface dwellers with invisible deep-marks for future "collection"
> - The palanquin water contains a scrying pool linked to the Sunken Sovereign
> - Plans to trigger controlled flooding of [[Port Meridian|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]] to establish an Aquabyssos foothold
> - Carries a Tide Pearl that can summon a tsunami once per year

## Embassy: The Cerulean Depths
Located in Crystalhaven's Embassy Quarter, her residence is a architectural marvel:
- Building partially flooded with breathable enchanted water
- Contains a portal pool to Aquabyssos (heavily guarded secret)
- Houses a growing collection of surface artifacts for study
- Basement connects to flooded tunnels beneath the city

## Plot Hooks
1. Hires party to retrieve a sunken relic from pre-drowning ruins
2. Requests escort to [[Port Meridian|02 Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]] for "trade negotiations"
3. Offers valuable information about underwater passages in exchange for crystal samples
4. Needs discrete investigation of ships that have been exploring too deep

## DM Notes
Nerida represents the looming threat of Aquabyssos while maintaining plausible deniability. She's a master manipulator who views the surface world as a chess board for the Tidal Courts' expansion. Her presence should make players question whether cooperation or conflict with the underwater realm is inevitable.
