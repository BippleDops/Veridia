- **Timeline Coherence**: Temporal consistency and chronological navigation
- **Political Complexity**: Faction relationship networks and diplomatic tracking
- **Cultural Immersion**: Daily life practices and environmental atmosphere
- **Campaign Integration**: Quest-world integration and impact assessment

The enhancement creates a foundation for advanced campaign management while maintaining the flexibility and creativity that makes tabletop RPGs engaging. All systems are designed to support, not replace, human creativity and storytelling.

**Phase 3 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Next Phase**: Phase 4 - Advanced Automation & Dynamic Systems
