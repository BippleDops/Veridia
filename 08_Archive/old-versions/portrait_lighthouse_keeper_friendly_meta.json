    "description": "Alaric Stormwatch is a weathered guardian who has stood vigil at Beacon Point Lighthouse for over two decades. His half-elven heritage shows in his ageless features and pointed ears, though years of maritime weather have given him a permanent tan and a network of laugh lines around his sharp green eyes. Standing 5'10\" with salt-and-pepper hair often tied back against ocean winds, he moves with the sure-footed grace of someone completely at home on rocky shores and storm-lashed cliffs.\n\nThe lighthouse he tends is no ordinary beaconâ€”its crystal core was a gift from [[Queen Seraphina Lumengarde]], enhanced with Aethermoor's pure crystal magic to pierce both natural darkness and shadow manifestations. The light serves as both navigation aid and early warning system, its patterns understood by sailors throughout the realm.\n\nAlaric's quarters atop the lighthouse are spartan but functional: charts of every current and reef for fifty miles, a collection of message bottles from grateful sailors, and a small shrine to Tempus, god of storms. His most prized possession is the Storm Mirror, a scrying device that lets him observe weather patterns and potential threats across the entire coast.",
