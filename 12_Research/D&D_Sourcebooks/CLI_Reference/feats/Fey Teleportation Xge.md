--- # Fey Teleportation

*Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 74* **Prerequisite**: [[elf-xphb (races)]] Your study of high elven lore has unlocked fey power that few other elves possess, except your eladrin cousins. Drawing on your fey ancestry, you can momentarily stride through the Feywild to shorten your path from one place to another. You gain the following benefits: - Increase your Intelligence or Charisma by 1, to a maximum of 20. - You learn to speak, read, and write Sylvan. - You learn the [[Misty Step Xphb]] spell and can cast it once without expending a spell slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way when you finish a short or long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this spell. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Fey teleportation xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
