(party-level)d100 # Gold piece rewards scaled to level --- ### Power Scaling Philosophy

The Seven Shards represent ultimate cosmic power, but each comes with significant costs. Players must weigh the benefits against corruption risks, creating meaningful choices throughout the campaign. ### 5e Integration Strategy

All mechanics use existing 5e frameworks where possible, with unique elements clearly marked. This ensures compatibility with official content while maintaining the campaign's unique flavor. ### Reward Pacing

Rewards escalate from uncommon items in early sessions to legendary artifacts by campaign's end, but corruption and curse mechanics prevent power creep from breaking game balance. ### Player Agency

The corruption system and shard powers give players meaningful choices about character development, with no "correct" path through the campaign's challenges. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## DM Notes *Private notes for campaign integration:*
