# The Deep Mother
*She Who Dreams Beneath, The Primordial Womb, Mother of Shadows and Sorrows*

## Overview
The Deep Mother is the primordial entity believed to slumber in the deepest trenches beneath [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos]]. According to ancient [[02_Worldbuilding/People/Aboleth Prime Yoth]] memories and the teachings of [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Drowned Prophets]], she is the source of all water, darkness, and dreams in the world. Her endless slumber generates the reality of Aquabyssos itselfâ€”the underwater realm exists within her dreaming consciousness.

## Divine Portfolio
- **Domains**: Dreams, Depths, Shadows, Memory, Transformation, Sorrow
- **Sacred Elements**: Dark water, pressure, luminescent creatures, shadow
- **Holy Symbol**: A spiral of darkness with a single eye at its center
- **Favored Offerings**: Memories, final breaths, shadow essence, pearls of sorrow

## Creation Mythology

### The First Dream
Before time, before light, there was only the Deep Mother floating in the primordial void. Her first dream created water, her second created darkness, and her third created the potential for life. As she descended into deeper slumber, her dreams became more complex, birthing:

1. **The Depths**: Physical layers of reality corresponding to sleep stages
2. **The Aboleths**: First children, born from her memories
3. **Shadows**: Fragments of her unconscious mind
4. **Pressure**: Her embrace holding reality together
5. **The [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Hadal Depths]]**: Where her physical form rests

### The Great Awakening (Prophecy)
Multiple conflicting prophecies describe what will happen if the Deep Mother awakens:
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Drowned Prophets]]**: She will remake reality as paradise
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Aboleth Prime Yoth]]**: All will merge into singular consciousness
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/The Scattered Emperor]]**: The world will dissolve back into void
- **[[02_Worldbuilding/People/Prophet Nerida Voidgazer]]**: She already awakens through the shadows

## Physical Manifestations

### The Sleeping Form
Deep beneath the [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Hadal Depths]], explorers claim to have seen:
- Mountain ranges that are actually her coiled body
- Abyssal trenches that are spaces between her tentacles
- Volcanic vents that are her slow breaths
- Bioluminescent zones marking her dreams
- The [[Depth Pulse]]: Her heartbeat felt throughout Aquabyssos

### Dream Emanations
Her dreams manifest physically as:
- **Shadow Creatures**: Nightmares given form
- **Memory Currents**: Streams of collective unconscious
- **Pressure Zones**: Emotional weight made physical
- **Temporal Distortions**: Dreams where time flows differently
- **The [[Shadow Convergence]]**: Her approaching awakening

## Religious Practices
