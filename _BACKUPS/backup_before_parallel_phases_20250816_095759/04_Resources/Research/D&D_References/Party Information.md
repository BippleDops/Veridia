--- # Party Information *"Know your allies, for in the depths, trust flows deeper than blood."* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview

Party Information encompasses the tracking and management of adventuring group dynamics, character relationships, shared resources, and collective reputation throughout both Aquabyssos and Aethermoor. This system goes beyond basic character statistics to include political affiliations, cultural connections, and the complex web of alliances and enemies that develop during inter-realm adventures. ## Historical Background

As adventuring groups began operating across both realms, the need for comprehensive party tracking became apparent. Traditional surface-based adventure records proved inadequate when dealing with underwater politics, pressure-based social hierarchies, and the fluid nature of aquatic alliances. Nevertheless, ## Current State

Modern party information systems track reputation across multiple factions, cultural adaptation levels, magical corruption exposure, and the complex relationships formed during inter-realm adventures. This data influences NPC reactions, available opportunities, and potential consequences. ### Aquabyssos

Underwater society views party composition and dynamics as crucial indicators of trustworthiness and competence. Mixed surface-underwater parties are seen as symbols of cooperation or suspicion depending on political climate. ### Aethermoor

Surface dwellers increasingly recognize the value of diverse party composition when dealing with inter-realm challenges. Traditional adventuring party roles have expanded to include cultural liaisons and depth adaptation specialists. ### Duration

Ongoing campaign element requiring constant updates and maintece. ## Adventure Hooks

1. **Identity Crisis**: Party members must prove their collective innocence
2. **Reputation Recovery**: Repair damaged standing with crucial faction
3. **Legacy Investigation**: Research the history of a legendary party ## Secrets (DM Only)

Some long-term adventuring parties develop subtle magical bonds that allow limited telepathic communication and shared magical resistance. ## Campaign Use

Use party information to create personalized consequences, rewards, and opportunities. Track reputation changes to make the world feel reactive to player choices. ## Player-Facing Summary Party Information is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Party Information as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Party Information. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
