# Oathbow
*Very rare (requires attunement)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/oathbow.webp#right)


When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, "Swift defeat to my enemies." When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can utter or sign the following command words: "Swift death to you who have wronged me." The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn 7 days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.

When you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have [[advantage-xphb|Advantage]] on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from [[cover-xphb|Half Cover]] or [[cover-xphb|Three-Quarters Cover]], and you suffer no [[disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra `3d6` Piercing damage.

While your sworn enemy lives, you have [[disadvantage-xphb|Disadvantage]] on attack rolls with all other weapons.
