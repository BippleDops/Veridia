## Special Traits
**Camouflage:** A vegepygmy has tactical advantage on Stealth checks in areas with dense vegetation.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A vegepygmy chief makes two melee attacks or two ranged attacks, or one spores attack.

**Claws:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 8 (`dice: 2d4+3`) slashing damage.

**Spear:** *Ranged Attack:* +5 to hit, range 20 ft./80 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d8+3`) piercing damage.

**Spores (Recharge 5—6):** *Area Attack:* automatic hit, 40 ft. cone, creatures in cone,. Hit: targets must make successful DC 13 Constitution saving throws against poison or be paralyzed for `dice: 2d6` rounds. When paralysis ends, affected creatures take 10 (`dice: 3d6`) poison damage, or half damage with a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw. Creatures that die from the poison damage reanimate 24 hours later as [[Vegepygmy Guard|vegepygmy guards]]. The paralysis can be ended early by magic that neutralizes poison; ending the effect early also eliminates the second saving throw. Plant creatures are immune to this effect.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Underground

**Organization**: Band (1 chief, 2–16 guards, and 3–24 workers) or tribe (2–4 chiefs, 3–24 guards, 3–300 commoners and workers, 1–4 patches of [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/H-Z/Russet Mold|russet mold]])

## Description
Vegepygmies are low-intelligence plant creatures that make their homes deep in forests or underground regions far from areas settled by humanois. They are carnivorous hunter/scavengers, but their usual prey is small game. They don’t bother larger creatures or other intelligent species except in times of great need.

Vegepygmies are most dangerous when they experience a sudden surge in population. At those times, their growing numbers outstrip the local food supply and force them to march into new territory. Although they are capable of fighting larger, stronger creatures for dominance, they prefer to let [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Bestiary/Fifth Edition Foes/H-Z/Russet Mold|russet mold]] do most of the work, converting the prior inhabitants of their new territory into more [[Vegepygmy Commoner and Worker|vegepygmy commoners]] and workers.

Most vegepygmies are 2 to 4 feet tall. They continue growing throughout their lives, “maturing” from commoners to workers to guards. Only chiefs grow to 5 feet or more. It’s logical to assume that chiefs are the ultimate developmental form of guards, but their rarity calls this into question. Some scholars hypothesize that chiefs are created when needed, in a manner similar to the way ants create queens when needed.

They have no apparent ears, but it’s well known that vegepygmies can hear. Their mouths are used only for eating. Vegepygmies never speak; they communicate with others of their kind by thumping their chests and rapping their spears on rocks, earth, or some other solid surface. They appear to understand Undercommon, but whether they have some means of communicating with other species is unknown.
