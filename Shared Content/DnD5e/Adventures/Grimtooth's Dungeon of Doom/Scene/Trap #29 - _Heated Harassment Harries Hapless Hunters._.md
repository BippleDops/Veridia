# Trap #29 - "Heated Harassment Harries Hapless Hunters."
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> The stair to the right leads upward 30 feet and is 10 feet wide. The stairs themselves are metal and inclined at a steep angle. At the far end of the stairs is a nonstandard door, the details of which are hard to make out at this distance. As the party climbs the stair they will, within 10 feet of the bottom, encounter some cobwebs. They are slightly sticky and break easily to the passage of the torch or the brush of a hand. They cover the entire opening of the stair way, but so thinly that they are only just visible in the torch ( or whatever) light Concealed amongst the cobwebs is an ultra fine trip wire. The wire is strong enough for the delver who breaks it to have an 80% chance (L2) of detecting that something is amiss.
> 
> In a complex of chambers above the stairs there is a network of steam vents. Their sou rce is geyserlike geothennal energy. When the wire is broken, the steam flows down conduits in the walls and into a network of metal pipes under the stairs. The bottom of this pipeline is perforated so that the steam will flow out fast enough so to permit a steady flow of more fresh, hot steam. All this drains down into a vast chamber under the stairs. The stairs will in short order take on the heat of the live steam, and reach a temperature of several hundred degrees. Barefooted characters will be deeply distressed; those with armored foot gear will also be negatively affected as their "protection" heats up.
> 
> The best part of the trap is that the door, when reached, has no handle, and seemingly no opening mechanism at all. The plaster that covers it is laid over iron so attempts to dig through or chop down the door will be fruitless, and time consuming, as the temperature of the stairwell increases. If a character spends more than three turns engaged in strenuous activity at the top of the stairs there is a very real chance of heat stroke! (The chance should start low, say 20% (L2), for tum 3 at the top, this should escalate to a 30% chance (L3) for the fourth turn at the top, and so on.)
> 
> The punch line of the joke is that the door will open by itself in 15 turns, when the supply of steam runs out and the residual condenses. Al this time the door simply drops into a slot in the floor, assuming the party has not so deformed it that it will no longer fit.
> 
> I like a hot foot as much as the next guy and this one is pretty well done, but with the exception of the heat stroke potential, and some potential foot bums, this trap only rated one skull. This trap gives the party a chance to take a "breather" for a change.
