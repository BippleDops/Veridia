--- # Action

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 360. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* On your turn, you can take one action. Choose which action to take from those below or from the special actions provided by your features. These actions are defined elsewhere in this glossary: - [[actions#Attack|Attack - [actions#Dodge|Dodge]] - [[actions#Dash|Dash - [actions#Help|Help]] - [[actions#Disengage|Disengage - [actions#Hide|Hide]] - [[actions#Influence|Influence - [actions#Magic|Magic]] - [[actions#Ready|Ready - [actions#Search|Search]] - [[actions#Study|Study - [actions#Utilize|Utilize]] ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Action xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of action xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around action xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Secret Connections *[Hidden from players]* Connected to The Hidden Alliance - Manipulate succession ## Plot Hooks - A merchant needs help delivering before the festival
