# Helping Hand (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *evocation*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self (5-mile radius)

**Components**: V, S, M (a black silk glove)

**Duration**: 6 hours


## Effects
Used primarily when you are trapped or otherwise in danger, you summon a hovering, insubstantial and translucent, 1-foot tall hand. You can then command the hand to locate a creature of your choice, based on a physical description. You can specify race, sex, and general appearance.

The hand then flies off with a speed of 60 feet, and it can pass through a crack as nar-row as 1 inch without squeezing. If it finds such a creature, it will beckon for that creature to follow. If that creature follows, it will point in your direction and lead the creature in the most direct route to you. It will stay about 10 feet ahead of the creature and will pause to let it catch up, but it doesnâ€™t understand concepts such as safety.

If the subject decides not to follow it, the hand will return to you and hover, palmup, to indicate failure. It will then vanish.
