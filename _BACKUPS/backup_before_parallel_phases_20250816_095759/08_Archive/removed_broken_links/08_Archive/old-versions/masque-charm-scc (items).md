*Wondrous item, common* A masque charm is a small silver pin. While wearing this charm, you can use an action to cast the [[disguise-self-xphb (spells) spell (**DC 13** to discern the disguise). Once the spell is cast, it can't be cast from the charm again until the next sunset. When casting the spell, you can have the spell last for its normal 1 hour duration or for 6 hours. If you choose the 6-hour duration, the charm becomes nonmagical when the spell ends. In either case, the spell ends if the charm is removed from you. *Source: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos p. 127* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Masque charm scc is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
