# The Order of the Azure Flame

## General Info
**Leader**: High Inquisitor Valerius
**Headquarters**: The Citadel of Azure Flame
**Location**: [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/The Whispering Peaks]]

## Description
The Order of the Azure Flame is a militant monastic order dedicated to the eradication of arcane magic. They believe that the misuse of magic was the sole cause of the Sundering, and they see it as their sacred duty to prevent such a cataclysm from ever happening again. The Order is known for its fanatical devotion to its cause, and its members are highly trained in the detection and suppression of magic.

## Goals
- To destroy all magical artifacts and tomes from the old world.
- To hunt down and "cleanse" all arcane magic users.
- To establish a new world order free from the corrupting influence of magic.

## Methods
The Order employs a variety of methods to achieve its goals, from public burnings of magical artifacts to secret inquisitions and assassinations. They are masters of propaganda and have a great deal of influence over the common people, who they have convinced that magic is a dangerous and corrupting force.

## GM Notes
- The Order is a major antagonist for any magic-using players.
- The Order is a good source of conflict and moral ambiguity.
- The Order is not entirely evil, and some of its members are genuinely trying to protect the world from what they see as a great danger.
