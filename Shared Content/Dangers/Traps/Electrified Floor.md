# Electrified Floor
## Overview
*Magical trap*
These metal plates cover a 10-foot-square area and are painted to match the appearance of the rest of the floor. A character can hear the low of hum of energy in the room with a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. A DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the painted section of the floor.

A character wearing heavily insulated footwear (such as rubber boots) can cross the area without any trouble. Throwing a large metal object onto the floor (such as a full suit of plate mail) and leaving it there for one minute causes the magical energy within the floor to overload and disables the trap. The object explodes at the end of one minute. All creatures within 10 feet of the floor must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures who fail take 5 (1d10) lightning and 5 (piercing) damage. Creatures who succeed take half damage.

Any creature who steps onto the floor while it is active takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. A creature who fails is paralyzed until the end of its next turn. If the creature is still touching the trap at the start of its next turn, it must take the damage and repeat the saving throw. Any creature who touches another creature who is touching the trap must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 22 (4d10) lightning damage on a failed saving throw or half as much on a successful one.
