# Instrument of the Bards, Doss Lute
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a bard)*  
![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/items/img/doss-lute.webp#right)

An Instrument of the Bards is superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. Seven types of these instruments exist, each named after a bard college. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take `2d4` Psychic damage.

You can play the Doss [[lute xphb|Lute]] to cast one of the following spells: [[fly xphb|Fly]], [[invisibility xphb|Invisibility]], [[levitate xphb|Levitate]], [[protection from evil and good xphb|Protection from Evil and Good]], [[animal friendship xphb|Animal Friendship]], [[protection from energy xphb|Protection from Energy]] (Fire damage only), and [[protection from poison xphb|Protection from Poison]]. Once the Doss [[lute xphb|Lute]] has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.
