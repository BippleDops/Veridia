## Description
Flavored with rum or brandy from the Pirate Isles of the Inner Sea, and studded with dried fruits (dates, citron, currants, raisins, cherries, and more) and [[Nuts|nuts]] (walnuts, hazelnuts, and filberts), these make lovely accompaniments to afternoon [[Tea|tea]]. (Let them age long enough, though, and they also make fine missile weapons, doorstops, paperweights, and ballast.) Shipped in a decorative tin, pattern may vary (let us choose for you). Fruitcake: 10 gp, includes tin.
