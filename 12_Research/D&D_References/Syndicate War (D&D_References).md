--- # Syndicate War ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Role and Motive

Syndicate War moves information and influence like currency. Publicly pragmatic, privately driven by a personal stake in the Convergenceâ€™s shape. - Ideal: Stability through controlled risk.
- Bond: A family archive tied to [[The Sunken Library]].
- Flaw: Overconfidence in leverage; underestimates zealots and true believers. ## Player-Facing Summary Syndicate War is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Syndicate War as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around Syndicate War. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## Plot Hooks - A noble needs help delivering before dawn
