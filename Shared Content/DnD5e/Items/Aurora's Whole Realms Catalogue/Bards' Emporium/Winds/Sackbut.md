## Description
This odd brass [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Items/Aurora's Whole Realms Catalogue/Bards' Emporium/Winds/Horn|horn]] produces a variety of low tones through use of a sliding mechanism. The sliding action can also produce a very vulgar slurring sound, made loud and blatty by the broad bell at the end. (45 gp)
