# Extreme Cold
*Environmental Hazard*  

When the temperature is 0 degrees Fahrenheit or lower, a creature exposed to the extreme cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain 1 [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Exhaustion|Exhaustion]] level. Creatures that have [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/resistance-xphb|Resistance]] or [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/immunity-xphb|Immunity]] to Cold damage automatically succeed on the save.
