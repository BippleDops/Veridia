**Bite:** *Melee Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature grappled by the gloom crawler. Hit: 10 (`dice: 1d10+5`) piercing damage and the creature is dragged to the gloom crawler's mouth.

**Tentacle Slam:** *Melee Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (`dice: 1d8+5`) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled.

**Tentacle Constriction:** *Melee Attack:* automatic hit, one creature already grappled by the gloom crawler at the start of the gloom crawler's turn. Hit: 9 (`dice: 1d8+5`) bludgeoning damage and the target is grappled and restrained.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Temperate

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
The gloom crawler is a solitary creature resembling a giant squid with ebony skin and dozens of writhing tentacles. It makes its lair in caves, dungeons, and other subterranean complexes far away from the hated light of the surface world. Most of its time is spent in dormant dreaming, waking only occasionally to eat.

The gloom crawler moves through its underground world by attaching to any surface with the suction cups on its tentacles. The average gloom crawler has from thirty to forty tentacles, each 15 to 30 feet long. Besides suction cups, each tentacle has a small eye near the tip that allows the creature to see in all directions at once and to peek around corners or over ledges while remaining almost completely concealed.

Gloom crawlers are omnivores; under normal conditions, they sustain themselves on a diet of plants, moss, rodents, and other subterranean fauna. They do not, however, turn down the chance for a larger meal, such as that offered by a foolhardy adventurer who stumbles into a gloom crawler’s lair.

When a potential opponent approaches a gloom crawler, the creature lashes out with its tentacles to grab the foe. A gloom crawler can bring up to five tentacles to bear against a single target. It always chooses to bite the softest target available (the one with the lowest AC).
