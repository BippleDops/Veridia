# Ambush
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 94*  

When you make a Dexterity ([[skills#Stealth|Stealth]]) check or an [[initiative-xphb|Initiative]] roll, you can expend one Superiority Die and add the die to the roll, unless you have the [[conditions#Incapacitated|Incapacitated]] condition.

## Player-Facing Summary

Ambush xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of ambush xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around ambush xphb.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties ambush xphb to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at ambush xphb to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to ambush xphb active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
