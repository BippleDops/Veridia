# Color Spray
A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand. Roll 6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell can effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are affected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring [[unconscious]] creatures and creatures that can't see).

Starting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is [[blinded]] until the end of your next turn. Subtract each creature's hit points from the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that creature to be affected.


When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level above 1st.
