# Cursed Image (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *4th-level*

**School**: *necromancy*

**Special Nature**: *ritual*

**Casting Time**: 1 hour

**Range**: 1 mile

**Components**: V, S, M (a clay image)

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute


## Effects
You create a small effigy out of clay that resembles your target. You must know this target’s appearance and his general whereabouts. You may then choose of the following actions to take:

♦ ***Immobilization.*** You hold the effigy tightly. The target becomes paralyzed. The escape DC is equal to your spell save DC.

♦ ***Wounding.*** You stab or pummel the effigy. The target may attempt to avoid tak-ing damage by making a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 3d10 force damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

If you incorporate a bit of hair, skin, blood, nail clipping, etc., your target is at disadvantage on his attempts to escape and his saving throw.
