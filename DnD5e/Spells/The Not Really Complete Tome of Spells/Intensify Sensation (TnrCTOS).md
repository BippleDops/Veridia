## Effects
You touch a creature, who must make a Constitution saving throw if unwilling. The creature will perceive any physical or emotional sensation as being unbelievably powerful, for good or bad. A creature under the influence of this spell is incapacitated for the duration.

Spells designed to create an emotion or physical sensation have twice the duration as normal and the creature saves against them at disadvantage.
