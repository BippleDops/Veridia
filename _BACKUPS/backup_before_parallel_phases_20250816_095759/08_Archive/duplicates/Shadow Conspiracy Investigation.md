The Shadow Conspiracy Investigation (SCI) is a covert intelligence organization dedicated to uncovering, documenting, and ultimately dismantling [[The Shadow Conspiracy|02 Worldbuilding/Groups/The Shadow Conspiracy. Born from the growing suspicions of several high-ranking officials who noticed inconsistencies in their colleagues' behavior, the SCI operates in complete secrecy, knowing that discovery would mean certain death or replacement.

**After the Conspiracy Falls**

Members debate what should happen to defeated shadows. Options range from exile to integration to elimination, with passionate advocates for each approach creating ideological divisions. ### The Double Agent Network

**The Gray Operatives**

A secret sub-organization within SCI consists of members who have allowed themselves to be "recruited" by the shadow conspiracy. Their dual loyalty creates security risks and ethical dilemmas. ### The Extremist Faction
