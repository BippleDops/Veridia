# Conjoined Creature
## Overview
### Conjoined Creature

While there are many ways in which twins can be conjoined, this template assumes that one is a parasitic twin and fully dependent on the other. The parasitic twin emerges only from the waist up, is smaller than the base creature, and is completely under the base creature’s control.

Any living humanoid and many beasts can become the basis for creating a conjoined creature. A conjoined creature uses the base creature’s stat block, with the follosing differences:

- Challenge increases by 2.

- Constitution increases by 4.

- Has proficiency on Perception checks, or double proficiency if it already had proficiency.

- Has proficiency on Wis saving throws.

- **Dual Mind (1/day):** When the conjoined creature fails a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, it can choose to succeed instead.

- **Multiattack:** The conjoined creature can make its basic attack twice. If it already has Multiattack, its number of attacks doubles. All extra attacks do half damage. Instead of making these extra attacks, the conjoined creature can instead cast a cantrip, search, or use an object as a bonus action.
