# The Threshold Chambers
*Where Two Worlds Become One*

## Overview
The Threshold Chambers serve as the secret headquarters of [[02_Worldbuilding/Groups/The Convergence Seekers, existing in a carefully constructed dimensional space that partially overlaps both [02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aethermoor]] and [[02_Worldbuilding/Places/Aquabyssos.
