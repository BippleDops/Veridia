## Description
Here is a machine for one man on a wall to fight like twenty. He uses special [[Tongs|tongs]] to put a rock or ball of iron in the cup, then hits it with a [[Mallet|mallet]]. A castle with these stands good on first strike. They are reloaded quick in battle. The ball or rock can weigh up to 25 pounds. I make them in groups of eight for 180 gp.
