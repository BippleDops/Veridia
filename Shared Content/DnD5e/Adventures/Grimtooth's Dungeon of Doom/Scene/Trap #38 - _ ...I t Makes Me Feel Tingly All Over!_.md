# Trap #38 - " ...I t Makes Me Feel Tingly All Over!"
## Overview
**Scene Type**: Encounter
#Scene-Type/Encounter

> [!WARNING]+ GM Directions
> Once the Party has left the room with the narcotic dust, they will find themselves in a hall 50 feet long 10 feet tall and 10 feet wide. The end of the hall is invisible in the darkness, and upon inspection will be found to end in a blank stone wall. No amount of digging or scraping will reveal anything but stone. However, 30 feet down on the right hand side is a bronze door.
> 
> When the party reaches the door they will find it to be yet another of those doors that depict an event in the life of the wizard Evinrood. On the face of the door, a masterpiece of the bronze casters art, is depicted a young Evinrood. He is familiar by his short stumpy stature. He is in a vast library, seated at a desk. There is a look of profound surprise on his face. In the center of the door there is a large wheel. This is clearly the mechanism by which the door can be opened. A careful inspection will reveal no other alternatives, and the door is formidible in construction, ruling out direct assault.
> 
> As usual the delvers will be certain it is a trap, which of course it is, and will attempt to put off the inevitable by discussing it. This fear of the unknown will eventually be overcome by basic greed and finally the wheel will be turned, with no visible effect.
> 
> The wheel turns with gradually increasing effort, and once turned the direction cannot be reversed. After 25 to 30 full rotations there will be heard a loud Thung! sound from within the structure of the door itseif. At the same time there will be a sudden release of tension on the wheel.
> 
> Inside the door is a spring mechanism that the hapless tomb robber has been obligingly winding for us. At a certain point the spring will reach optimum tension and break free of the winding mechanism. This creates the "Thung!" sound. The spring will then begin to unwind at great speed turning a copper covered lodestone disk against a brush like arrangement within the door. The copper disk is 5 feet in diameter and spins freely, driven by the spring. This will create a very lively spark which just happens to be grounded out through the wheel that is used to wind the spring. (This is a contained, and smaller version of the trap at [[1 - The Entrance|the entrance]]. Neat, portable, and usable everywhere. If they weren't so difficult to make I think the old Mage would have used them throughout the dungeon.)
> 
> The lucky tomb crasher who has been turning the wheel has a 30% chance to let go in time (L3) otherwise he will be subjected to the static jolt! If the character is of less than average physical health the shock will likely cause cardiac arrest. If the delver is of average or greater constitution, there will just be a nasty jolt, and some burns on the hands.
> 
> As usual in this cozy tomb, once the trap has been sprung, the door opens.
> 
> I'd rate this trap at only one skull. By this time the party is probably using insulated gloves, and anticipating traps on everything. If they are not, the trap is still fairly lightweight, because Evinrood really doesn't want to discourage entry to the upcoming room. If a Trap master wanted to use this trap to its best advantage a combination of gears will amplify the fly speed of the copper wheel, and copper plating placed on the floor of the corridor will enhance the effect (Then you end up with at least a two skuller.)
