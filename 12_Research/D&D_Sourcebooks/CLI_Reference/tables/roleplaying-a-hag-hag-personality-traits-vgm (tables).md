| dice: d8 | Personality Trait |
|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | I have made subtle insults into an art form. |
| 2 | I always act unpleasant so others never learn of my secret affections. |
| 3 | I enjoy wagers as parts of my bargains, which increase the risk and the stakes. |
| 4 | I laugh at my own jokes-the darker, the better. |
| 5 | I never volunteer information, and I respond only to questions. |
| 6 | I offer generous terms in my deals, but the cost for defaulting is exceedingly high. |
| 7 | I require all of my bargains to be put in writing and signed in the other party's blood. |
| 8 | I am very superstitious, and I see omens in every event and action around me. |
