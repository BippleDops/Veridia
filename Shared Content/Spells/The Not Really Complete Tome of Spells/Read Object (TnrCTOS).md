# Read Object (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *3rd-level*

**School**: *divination*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Touch

**Components**: V, S, M (rare incense worth at least 50 gp)

**Duration**: Instantaneous


## Effects
You hold an item and learn the current or most recent owner’s race, class or profession, and alignment. In addition, roll a d6. On a roll of 1-4, it also reveals the last event that happened to the owner while he still had the object in its possession, *if* that event had some emotional importance. It does not reveal that person’s name, age, or anything else about him or her.
