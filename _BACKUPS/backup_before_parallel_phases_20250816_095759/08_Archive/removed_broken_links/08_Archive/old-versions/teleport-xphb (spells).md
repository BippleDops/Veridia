--- # Teleport

*7th-level, Conjuration* - **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be Large or smaller, and it can't be held or carried by an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls`d100`and consults the [[Teleportation Xphb Outcome table and the explanations after it. **Teleportation Outcome** | Familiarity | Mishap | Similar Area | Off Target | On Target |

|-------------|--------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Permanent circle | â€” | â€” | â€” | 01-00 |
| Linked object | â€” | â€” | â€” | 01-00 |
| Very familiar | 01-05 | 06-13 | 14-24 | 25-00 |
| Seen casually | 01-33 | 34-43 | 44-53 | 54-00 |
| Viewed once or described | 01-43 | 44-53 | 54-73 | 74-00 |
| False destination | 01-50 | 51-00 | â€” | â€” |

Perhaps you tried to scry an enemy's sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting to teleport to a location that no longer exists. ## Mishap The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes``dice: 3d10``Force damage, and the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each time). ## Similar Area You and your group (or the target object) appear in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area. You appear in the closest similar place. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for example, you might appear in another person's laboratory in the same city. ## Off Target You and your group (or the target object) appear``dice: 2d12``miles away from the destination in a random direction. Roll`d8`for the direction: 1, east; 2, southeast; 3, south; 4, southwest; 5, west; 6, northwest; 7, north; or 8, northeast. ## On Target You and your group (or the target object) appear where you intended. ## Summary **Classes**: [classes]]; [[classes; [classes]] *Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 331. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* ## Player-Facing Summary Teleport xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of teleport xphb as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around teleport xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## Spell Components Detail
