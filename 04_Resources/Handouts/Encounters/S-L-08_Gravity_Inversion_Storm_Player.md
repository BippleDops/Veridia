# Gravity Inversion Storm

Up and down change places. Your stomach forgets how to fall.

What you notice
- Loose tools float, then thud
- The ship creaks in strange directions

What you can try
- Strap in and call your movements
- Trust the helmsman

Possible outcomes
- You ride it like a story you’ll tell for years
- You come out banged up but smiling
- You hit hard
