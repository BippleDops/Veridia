Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around thunderclap xphb. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock.
