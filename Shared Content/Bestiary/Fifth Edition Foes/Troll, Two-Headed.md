## Description
The two-headed troll is thought to be the hideous offspring of an ettin and a female troll. Sages contend that no other explanation is possible (or bears thinking about) concerning this monster. They do not associate with ettins, but two-headed trolls are often found leading normal trolls during raids or wars. They are greatly feared, being bigger than and twice as cruel as other trolls.

Two-headed trolls make their lairs underground and, thankfully, far from civilization.

A two-headed troll stands 10 feet tall. Its hide is mottled green or gray, and its facial features resemble that of a standard troll. They dress in rags and uncured hides, and adapt battered armor from fallen foes to their own piecemeal use. Their feet and hands sport enormous claws. The twoheaded troll has the gait of a normal troll but walks fully upright, not hunched over, so they tower above other trolls.

On occasion, two-headed trolls have been known to wield captured or crudely-made clubs, axes, longswords, or even greatswords (onehanded).
