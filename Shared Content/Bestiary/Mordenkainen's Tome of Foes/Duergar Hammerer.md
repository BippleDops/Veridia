## Special Traits
***Engine of Pain.*** Once per turn, a creature that attacks the hammerer can target the duergar trapped in it. The attacker has disadvantage on the attack roll. On a hit, the attack deals an extra 5 ( `dice: 1d10`) damage to the hammerer, and the hammerer can respond by using its Multiattack with its reaction.

***Siege Monster.*** The hammerer deals double damage to objects and structures.

## Actions
***Multiattack.*** The hammerer makes two attacks: one with its claw and one with its hammer.

***Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 ( `dice: 1d6+3`) bludgeoning damage.

***Hammer.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 ( `dice: 2d6+3`) bludgeoning damage.

## Description
The hammerer is a digging machine with a duergar strapped inside itâ€”typically a punishment for those whose work ethic wavers. The machine's mechanism transforms the captive duergar's pain into energy that powers the device, which is typically used to dig tunnels and repel invaders.
