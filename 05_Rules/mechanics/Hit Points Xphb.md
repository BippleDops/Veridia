--- # Hit Points

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 368. Available in the SRD and the Free Rules (2024)* Hit Points (HP) are a measure of how difficult it is to kill or destroy a creature or an object. Damage reduces Hit Points, and healing restores them. You can't have more Hit Points than your Hit Point maximum, and you can't have less than 0. ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Hit points xphb is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
