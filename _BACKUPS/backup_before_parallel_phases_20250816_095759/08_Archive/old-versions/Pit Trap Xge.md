--- # Pit Trap

*Generic Hazard* The simplest of pit traps consists of a 10-foot-deep hole in the floor, concealed by tattered canvas that's covered with leaves and dirt to look like solid ground. This type of trap is useful for blocking off the entrance to a monster lair, and usually has narrow ledges along its sides to allow for movement around it. *Source: Xanathar's Guide to Everything p. 114* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Pit trap xge is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
