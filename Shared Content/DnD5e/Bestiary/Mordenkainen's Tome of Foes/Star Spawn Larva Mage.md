## Special Traits
***Innate Spellcasting.*** The larva mage's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At Will: *eldritch blast\*, minor illusion*
3/day: *dominate monster*
1/day: *circle of death*

\*3 beams, +3 bonus to each damage roll

***Return to Worms.*** When the larva mage is reduced to 0 hit points, it breaks apart into a swarm of insects in the same space. Unless the swarm is destroyed, the larva mage reforms from it 24 hours later.

## Actions
***Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 7 ( `dice: 1d8+3`) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its next turn.

***Plague of Worms (Recharge 6).*** Each creature other than a star spawn within 10 feet of the larva mage must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure the target takes 22 ( `dice: 5d8`) necrotic damage and is blinded and restrained by masses of swarming worms. The affected creature takes 22 ( `dice: 5d8`) necrotic damage at the start of each of the larva mage's turns. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Reactions
***Feed on Weakness.*** When a creature within 20 feet of the larva mage fails a saving throw, the larva mage gains 10 temporary hit points.

**Cantrip (Costs 2 Actions).** The larva mage casts one cantrip.

**Slam (Costs 2 Actions).** The larva mage makes one slam attack.

**Feed (Costs 3 Actions).** Each creature restrained by the larva mage's Plague of Worms takes 13 (`dice: 3d8`) necrotic damage, and the larva mage gains 6 temporary hit points.

## Description
A larva mage is a nightmarish combination of a mortal body and otherworldly substance. When a powerful cultist of a wormlike entity such as Kyuss or Kezef—usually a warlock or other spellcaster—contacts the comet-borne emissary of an Elder Evil, the emissary can merge with a mortal consciousness to create a larva mage. None of the original cultist's personality survives the transformation, so what emerges is wholly alien.
