# Sickening Radiance
Dim, greenish light spreads within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. The light spreads around corners, and it lasts until the spell ends.

When a creature moves into the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take `dice: 4d10|avg` (4d10) radiant damage, and it suffers one level of [[exhaustion]] and emits a dim, greenish light in a 5-foot radius. This light makes it impossible for the creature to benefit from being [[invisible]]. The light and any levels of [[exhaustion]] caused by this spell go away when the spell ends.
