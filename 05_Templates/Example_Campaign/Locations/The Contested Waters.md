## üåä Regional Overview

The **Contested Waters** represent one of the most politically volatile maritime regions in the known world. These treacherous seas have become the focal point of an escalating conflict between multiple powers, each claiming legitimate rights to control the vital shipping lanes that pass through these waters. What began as simple territorial disputes has evolved into a complex web of political intrigue, economic warfare, and increasing violence that threatens to destabilize the entire coastal trade network.

### Historical Context
Once the domain of the ancient **Mer-Folk Empire of Thalassopolis**, these waters have been contested for over 200 years since the empire's mysterious withdrawal to the deep ocean trenches. The strategic importance of the region has only grown as maritime trade expanded, making control of these shipping lanes equivalent to controlling the economic lifeline of the entire coast.
