## Session Timeline

### Opening Scene
**Location:** [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Whisper Island Docks]]
**Time:** Dawn, heavy fog
**Description:**
The party's boat cuts through unnatural fog thick as wool. Crystalline formations jut from the water like frozen lightning, scraping against the hull. Through the mist, the Seahawk emerges - a Meridian Navy ship half-consumed by purple crystal growth, frozen mid-scream. A figure in red robes watches from the lighthouse peak, then vanishes.

**Environmental:** 
- Fog provides heavy obscurement
- Crystal formations deal 1d6 damage on contact
- Strange whispers in unknown language (DC 13 Wisdom save or frightened 1 minute)

### Key Events

#### Event 1: The Crystallized Ship
**Location:** [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/The Seahawk]]
**NPCs:** None (Crystal Mimics disguised as equipment)
**Outcome:**
- Explore Captain Blackwater's abandoned vessel
- Main deck shows crystallized crew frozen mid-scream
- Captain's cabin has hidden compartment (Investigation DC 15)
- Find journal detailing "Seven Shards of the Deep God"
- Crystal mimics attack when investigating cargo

**Key Discovery:** Journal entry: "The seven shards aren't weapons - they're a prison. Something sleeps beneath the waves, and the crystals are its dreams made manifest."

#### Event 2: The Keeper's House
**Location:** [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/People/Lighthouse Keeper]]
**NPCs:** [[Jasper Three-Eyes Flint]]
**Outcome:**
- Find Jasper hiding, partially crystallized (30% transformed)
- He's paranoid but has vital information
- Persuasion DC 14 to calm him, DC 18 for full cooperation
- Reveals lighthouse was conducting "resonance experiments"
- Mentions seeing "things swimming in the air" when crystals activate

**Jasper's Revelation:** "They're not creating the plague... they're tuning it! Like a conductor with an orchestra of crystals. The Queen's seal was on the orders, but dated next month. How is that possible?"

#### Event 3: The Lighthouse Ascent
**Location:** [[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/Locations/Lighthouse of Storms|01 Campaigns/Aethermoor/Locations/Lighthouse Of Storms]] - Multiple floors
**NPCs:** Infected Experiments (hostile)
**Outcome:**
- **Ground Floor:** Ruined laboratory, broken containment circles
  - Investigation reveals Crimson Hand and Royal Seal markings
- **Second Floor:** Living quarters showing progression into madness
  - Diary entries become increasingly incoherent
- **Third Floor:** Library with burnt books
  - Some salvageable research notes about "harmonic frequencies"
- **Encounters:** Infected experiments attack on second floor

**Environmental Challenge:** Each floor closer to peak increases corruption (CON save DC 12 + floor number or gain 1 exposure)

#### Event 4: The Resonance Chamber
**Location:** [[01_Campaigns/Aethermoor/Locations/Lighthouse Peak - Resonance Chamber|01 Campaigns/Aethermoor/Locations/Lighthouse Peak Resonance Chamber]]
**NPCs:** [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/People/Vex Shadowthorn's Apprentices]] (2)
**Outcome:**
- Massive 20-foot crystal formation pulsing with energy
- Apprentices conducting ritual to "call the Deep God"
- Can attempt to reason (Persuasion DC 20) or fight
- Disrupting ritual triggers vision sequence
- [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Sage]] appears briefly to help if needed

### The Shared Vision
When the ritual is disrupted, everyone experiences:
> *You're falling... no, sinking. The world inverts. Below becomes above. You see a vast city of impossible architecture - spires that grow downward, water that flows upward, streets that exist in multiple dimensions simultaneously. Thousands of crystallized figures are arranged in prayer formation. A voice speaks in your minds, not in words but in pure meaning: "The Seventh Shard awakens. The Drowned God stirs. The surface world's time grows short."*

### Closing Scene
**Location:** [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/People/Lighthouse Keeper]]
**Cliffhanger:**
The party awakens from the vision to find three days have passed. Jasper is gone, leaving only a note: "They know you're here now. Both of them - the thing below and the one who wears the crown. The city prepares for war with itself. Trust the Sage, fear the Queen, find the Seven before the Festival. PS - I took one shard. Safer with me running than you fighting."

## Character Development
### Player Decisions

- Interpreting the vision's meaning

### Character Moments
- First contact with otherworldly intelligence

## World Changes

- Three days lost (major events occurred)
- Emergency council being prepared
- Jasper fled with one shard
- Party marked by the Deep God's attention

## Corruption Tracking
### Exposure Events
1. Crystal formations at dock (possible)
2. Investigating crystallized crew
3. Each lighthouse floor (scaling DC)
4. Resonance chamber proximity

### Infection Progression
- Note any party members reaching new thresholds
- Jasper demonstrates 30% transformation effects

## Seven Shards Mystery
### Current Knowledge
1. Shards are prison, not weapons
2. Something called "Deep God" imprisoned
3. Crystals are its dreams manifesting
4. Seven locations exist (map partially burnt)
5. Jasper stole one shard
6. Queen involved but timeline paradox
7. Festival is significant deadline

## Hooks for Next Session
1. Emergency council in [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Places/Port Meridian]]
2. Three days missing - what happened?
3. Jasper has one shard and is running
4. Festival deadline approaching
5. Queen's involvement suspicious
6. City "prepares for war with itself"

## GM Reflections
### What Worked
- Vision sequence impact
- Environmental storytelling on ship
- Jasper's paranoid personality

### What Didn't
- Track time loss consequences
- Balance combat vs. investigation

### To Improve
- Prepare "what happened in 3 days" events
- Detail emergency council attendees
- Plan Queen's public absence

## Player Feedback
<!-- Notes from post-session discussion -->
- 

## Prep for Next Session
- [ ] Create emergency council scenario
- [ ] Detail Lord [[vault_backup_20250813_073007/02_Worldbuilding/Lore/Aurelius Goldwave]] murder scene
- [ ] Prepare faction representatives
- [ ] Plan political intrigue encounters
- [ ] Develop "3 days of events" timeline
- [ ] Create Queen's representative NPC

## Resonance Crystal Mechanics
### Functions
- Allows communication with other resonance crystals
- Detects nearby shard presence (100 ft)
- Vibrates when lies are spoken near it
- Can record and playback 1 minute of sound

### Corruption Interaction
- Accelerates exposure near large crystal formations
- Can temporarily reduce exposure (1/day, -1 level for 1 hour)
- Reveals corruption level when held against skin
