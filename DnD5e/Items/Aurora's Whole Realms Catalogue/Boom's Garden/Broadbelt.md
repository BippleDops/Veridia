**Armor Class**: -1 to AC

**Stealth**: -

**Weight**: 12 lbs.

## Description
These [[Metal|metal]]-studded leather belts are the geographic and stylistic center of fashion armor: Broadbelts can support a [[Bustier|bustier]], carry weaponry, suspend a [[Loin Guard|loin guard]], and impress the enemy all at once. Our steel-spiked broadbelt is replete with small holes for mounting the aforementioned articles of armor or weaponry. The massive buckle can be tightened to compress one’s viscera when lifting heavy objects. Available in black or brown. For both male and female. (6 gp)

## Additional Details
Wt 12 lb; if used as weight belt, may prevent critical failure (DM’s discretion) for Str check; alone provides no AC adjustment; when used with [[Bustier|bustier]] and [[Loin Guard|loin guard]] provides -1 to AC
