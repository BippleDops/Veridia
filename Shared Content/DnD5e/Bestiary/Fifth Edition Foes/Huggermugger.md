## Special Traits
**Confusion Aura (1/Day):** When three huggermuggers gather in a group, they automatically generate an aura of confusion. All creatures within 40 feet of any one of the huggermuggers must make a successful DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be affected the same as if by a confusion spell for `dice: 1d6` rounds. Each of the huggermuggers generating the effect must be no more than 30 feet from both of the other two; if one of them moves outside that range or is killed, incapacitated, or knocked unconscious, the aura and the effect end immediately. If another huggermugger is within range of the other two, however, it can instantly assume the fallen huggermugger's role in maintaining the confusion aura, so there is no break in the aura's effect. An individual huggermugger can contribute to creating one confusion aura per day. A creature that successfully saves against the aura is immune to all huggermugger confusion auras until the end of their next long rest.

**Cunning:** Huggermuggers possess cunning and logical ability far beyond what their nominal Intelligence and Wisdom scores imply. They never lose their bearings in any setting, they are never surprised, and they can automatically follow any trail that's less than 24 hours old. They have tactical advantage on Wis (Survival) checks to follow a trail that's more than 24 hours old.

## Description
Huggermuggers are small humanoids that dwell underground. They relish chaos, disorder, trickery, and the fine art of thieving. Outside their own subterranean territory, these degenerate humanoid creatures have only been encountered in large cities with extensive sewer systems for them to hide in and travel through secretly. Nothing is known about how their race developed or how widely spread they are. Unkind observers compare them to rats, swarming up from the filth to feed on human society like scavengers or parasites. A few fearmongering city dwellers loudly speculate that the huggermuggers maintain vast tunnel complexes that connect all the large cities of the world and that some day this vile race will scramble up from the depths as an invading army. They have been known occasionally to work as bounty hunters; their tracking ability makes them amazing manhunters.

Huggermuggers chatter and mumble incessantly, but their sounds might or might not constitute an actual language. If it is a language, it has yet to be translated by sages, so what they call themselves remains a mystery. The term “huggermugger” is akin to “boogeyman,” being a name used in stories to scare children into keeping close to home and not exploring the sewers and dark alleys of the city.

Curiously, the skin of a huggermugger is pale and cold to the touch, regardless of the actual temperature in the surrounding area. They are believed to be cold-blooded mammals.

A band of huggermuggers circles its opponents, chattering and mumbling so as to cause confusion. They seldom reveal themselves to a foe unless they have a significant advantage in numbers. If outnumbered or clearly outclassed, huggermuggers prefer to attack from ambush, confusing their opponents before robbing or slaying them.
