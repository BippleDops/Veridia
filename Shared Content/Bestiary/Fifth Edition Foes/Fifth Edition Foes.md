**Summary:** Fifth Edition Foes - 5th Edition Rules, 1st Edition Feel

*Fifth Edition Foes* is a first step into supporting the Fifth Edition of everyone’s favorite roleplaying game. The monsters in this book should be familiar to anyone who enjoyed the Tome of Horrors supplements (all four volumes of it) published by Necromancer Games during the Third Edition era. Many of these monsters reach back further than those books, though, since they’re culled from First Edition volumes such as the Fiend Folio (1981) and Monster Manual II (1983)—and those books drew material from the even older pages of magazines like The Dragon and White Dwarf. So while the stat blocks and powers of these creatures are as up-to-date as we could make them, they also harken back to the very early years of roleplaying games, when any addition to the game—every new monster, spell, or magic item—was completely new and exciting.

I remember well the thrill that ran through the offices of TSR when a new book like the Fiend Folio arrived from the printer. Any pretense at trying to work was set aside as everyone tore into the latest shiny volume, examining stats, commenting on illustrations, discussing how the new creatures could be worked into upcoming adventures and which existing creatures and spells they could be paired with to produce really nasty surprises for players.

Updating these monsters to the latest edition brought back much of that same excitement. The rules of the game have changed in big ways and small over the decades, but the fundamental idea—a group of thrillseeking roustabouts relying on their prowess and their wits to survive in an imaginary world filled with magic and monsters—is still the same. Ideas and concepts that were challenging, frightening, or amusing to players’ imaginations in 1981 have the same potency today. Imagination never becomes obsolete because of new technology. As G. K. Chesterton wrote, “There are no rules of architecture for a castle in the clouds.”

We’re not relying on nostalgia to make these monsters interesting. This book lines up well with the Necromancer Games philosophy that the challenges faced by our imaginary heroes should be interesting and tough. Many of these creatures don’t fit neatly into level-specific challenges. Some of them punch well above their weight class. Others have an alarming ability to keep swinging long after other monsters would flee or perish. Shocks like those are what keep the game fresh and surprising. When there was doubt about how to rank a monster’s challenge rating, we intentionally erred on the low side, because players are resourceful. If they take a beating in their first meeting with a “level-appropriate” monster, they can fall back, dress their wounds, learn from the defeat, and come back the next day armed with a better plan that leads to victory. That refusal to admit defeat is, after all, part of the fabric of heroism.
