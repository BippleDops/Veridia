## Special Traits
**Cold and Fire Sensitivity:** If a furnace golem takes cold damage, its speed is halved, it can't take bonus actions, and it can make only one attack until the end of its next turn. If it is attacked with fire, it takes no damage but instead heals 1 hit point per 3 points of fire damage the attack would have inflicted. Excess hit points are gained as temporary hit points.

**Furnace:** As a bonus action at the start of its turn, a furnace golem can try to shove a grappled opponent into its interior furnace. The furnace golem makes a Strength check that is opposed by the grappled creature's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the grappled creature wins the contest, nothing happens. If the furnace golem wins the contest, the grappled creature is shoved into the furnace, where it is blinded and restrained. The trapped creature takes 13 (`dice: 2d8+4`) fire damage and gains one level of exhaustion at the start of each of its turns. The creature remains trapped until it uses an action to win an opposed Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the furnace golem's Constitution check. Alternatively, a creature outside the furnace golem can attempt a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against the golem's Constitution check to drag the trapped character free, but the rescuer automatically takes 13 (`dice: 2d8+4`) fire damage whether the attempt succeeds or fails. Only one creature of up to Medium size can be inside the golem's furnace.

**Heat:** A furnace golem's entire form is extremely hot. Creatures that attack a furnace golem with unarmed attacks or with natural weapons take 4 (`dice: 1d8`) fire damage each time one of their attacks hits.

**Magic Resistance:** A furnace golem has tactical advantage on saving throws versus spells and magical effects.

## Actions
**Multiattack:** A [[Flail Snail|flail snail]] attacks four times with tentacle clubs.

**Tentacle Club:** *Melee Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 7 (`dice: 1d8+3`) bludgeoning damage.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
Furnace golems are most often used to guard some arcane secret or treasure, though some are programmed to seek out objects or individuals. Those used as guards stand motionless, appearing as nothing more than a giant black iron statue, until activated.

Like other constructs, furnace golems obey their creator’s commands to the best of their ability. Should the creator die or its commands be impossible to follow, the furnace golem becomes an uncontrolled rogue; it remains completely functional, but it follows no commands or orders from anyone, being driven purely by its own limited, erratic intelligence.

The fire powering a furnace golem is magical in nature; it needs no fuel to continue burning forever and it can’t be extinguished except by more potent magic. If a furnace golem is destroyed, the fire in its innards continues burning for days before fading to a flicker and eventually dying.

A furnace golem’s body is constructed from 8,000 pounds of iron mixed with rare ingredients and chemicals totaling 12,000 gp.
