## Special Traits
**Transformation:** A dominated creature is completely under the were-mists control. At the start of its next turn, as a bonus action, the dominated creature transforms into the hybrid form of a wereboar, wererat, or werewolf (the form is chosen by the were-mist). The transformed creature has the stats and abilities of its new form, but it cant cause lycanthropy. Transformation into a beast heals all lost hit points the same as a long rest, but doesnt affect damaging conditions such as poisoning or disease. The domination and transformation are permanent until the were-mist is killed, is driven off, or leaves voluntarily. The were-mist can be attacked with weapons and with targeted spells without endangering the enveloped creature, but the transformed victim is subject to area affects as normal. The were-mist leaves the transformed creature and seeks a new victim when the transformed creature drops to 10 or fewer hit points. When the were-mist leaves or is killed, the transformed creature immediately transforms back into its normal form, with the same number of hit points it had in were-form. The creature is also stunned until it makes a successful DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the start of its turn. Killing or knocking out the transformed creature has no effect on the weremist; it simply moves on to another victim.

**Variable CR:** The challenge rating of a were-mist is the same as the type of beast it transforms victims into; CR 2 for wererats, CR 3 for werewolves, or CR 4 for wereboars. If it transforms victims into more than one type in an encounter, use the highest value.

## Actions
**Domination:** *Melee Attack:* automatic hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: the target must make a successful DC 13 Charisma saving throw or the were-mist enters the target creatures space and the target is dominated and transformed by the were-mist; see Transformation, above.

## Ecology
**Environment**: Any

**Organization**: Solitary

## Description
Despite its name, a were-mist is not a true lycanthrope, but is a monster than can inflict involuntary shapechange upon other creatures. The were-mist attacks by enveloping its chosen victim and trying to transform it. If the surrounded creature fails to resist the were-mist’s assault, the creature transforms into a ravening, wolflike beast completely under the were-mist’s control.

The only clue that the victim is not a real lycanthrope is that the were-mist remains wrapped around the victim, giving the creature an eerie, almost ethereal appearance. The mist can be attacked without risk to the controlled creature, but it is resistant to many types of attack. Magic is the best offense.

When the were-mist’s victim is weakened by combat, the mist simply abandons it and moves on to a new victim. As soon as it departs, its control is broken and the slave returns to normal shape, but it usually takes several moments before it recovers from the shock of the experience. In battle, the were-mist moves from victim to victim, transforming them and forcing them to attack their allies, discarding each puppet when it becomes weak and moving to another.

Were-mists are solitary because of their rarity more than through any unwillingness to congregate. In rare instances, a lair containing more than one of these creatures might be found. They have no known means of reproduction, so such a lair probably could exist only near whatever force or source creates these malign entities.
