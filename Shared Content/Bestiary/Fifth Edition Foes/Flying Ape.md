## Actions
**Multiattack:** The flying ape attacks twice with its fists.

**Melee Attack—Fist:** +6 to hit (reach 5 ft.; one creature). Hit: `dice: 1d6 + 4` bludgeoning damage. If both fists hit the same target, the ape also rends, doing another `dice: 2d6` slashing damage and the target is grappled and restrained.

## Description
Flying apes are larger and more muscular than gorillas. Most have leathery wings similar to a bat’s, but some have feathered wings like a bird’s.

If a flying ape hits the same target with both of its slam attacks, it can either rend its foe for additional damage or gain a hold secure enough to carry the foe into the air, either to drop on a following round or to deliver the victim to the ape’s evil overlord, as applicable.

Typical flying apes are considerably less intelligent than humans, but smarter ones are not uncommon. It has been observed that as their intelligence increases, so does their tendency toward cruelty and evil behavior.
