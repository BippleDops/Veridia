## Description

Nerissa appears ageless, though she has ruled for nearly two centuries. Her silver hair flows constantly as if underwater even in air pockets, and her skin has a subtle pearl-like shimmer. She wears robes woven from crystallized water that shift and flow with her movements. Her eyes change color with her emotions - deep blue when calm, storm green when angered, grey when sorrowful.

## Background

Born into the Oracle bloodline that predicted the Great Submersion, Nerissa was raised from birth to lead Aquabyssos. She witnessed the last days of the surface empire through inherited memories and carries the weight of three thousand years of isolation. Her grandmother was the last Oracle to speak with [[Emperor Thalassius the Wise]] before his sacrifice.

### The Second Rising Prophecy
Her own visions show two paths:
1. Aquabyssos rises and burns in the sun
2. Aquabyssos stays and drowns in darkness
She seeks a third option but hasn't found it.

### Secret Projects
1. **Project Surface Light:** Building surface observation posts
2. **The Third Path:** Seeking way to partially surface Aquabyssos
3. **Memory Preservation:** Recording pre-Submersion history
4. **Void Research:** Investigating if the threat still exists

### [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]]
"My strong right hand, even when it forms a fist against me."
- Respects his dedication
- Frustrated by his rigid thinking
- Relies on him absolutely for defense

### [[The_Crimson_Pearl|02 Worldbuilding/People/The Crimson Pearl]]
"A parasite that keeps the body functioning."
- Knows she's corrupt but needs her network
- Has evidence of her crimes but can't act
- Secretly admires her effectiveness

### [[Aquabyssos|02 Worldbuilding/Quests/Aquabyssos]]
"She speaks truths I dare not think."
- Was once her student
- Sees her younger self in Miralyn
- Fears she might be right about returning

### [[Aboleth Prime Yoth]]
"The ancient darkness that remembers when we had legs."
- Bound by ancient pacts she must honor
- Knows it plots against her
- Needs its knowledge of pre-Submersion times

## Quest Hooks

1. **[[Tide Turner's Trident]]** - She secretly seeks proof the surface is safe
2. **[[The Crown's Burden]]** - Help her break the prophetic curse
3. **[[The Seven Seals]]** - Gather the Depth Seals before enemies do
4. **Diplomatic Immunity** - Escort her to dangerous negotiations

## Combat Tactics

**Never fights directly unless cornered**
- Summons water elementals
- Creates pressure barriers
- Escapes through water portals
- Uses prophecy to avoid conflict

**If forced to battle:**
- Opens with Tsunami
- Maintains Water Sphere for protection
- Uses Pressure Words to disable
- Retreats to Maelstrom Palace if losing

## Secrets & Mysteries

1. **The Fragment:** She wears a piece of the Heart of Oceanus as a necklace
2. **The Dreams:** Every night she relives the Submersion through ancestral memory
3. **The Lover:** Had a secret relationship with a surface dweller who died
4. **The Doubt:** No longer believes the Void Plague was real
5. **The Plan:** Has a way to raise only Pearl Harbor City as a test

### Plot Potential
- Could become ally or adversary based on party actions
- Her death would destabilize all Aquabyssos
- Key to any "return to surface" storyline
- Connects to larger cosmic threats through visions
