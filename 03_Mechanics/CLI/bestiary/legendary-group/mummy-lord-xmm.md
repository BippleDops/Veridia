# Mummy Lord

## Regional effects
_Source: Monster Manual (2024)_

The region containing a mummy lord's lair is warped by its presence, creating the following effects:

- **Cursed Fate.** Whenever a creature other than the mummy or one of its allies casts a Divination spell while within 1 mile of the lair, the creature makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, [Bonus Action](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/bonus-action-xphb.md), or [Reaction](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) used to cast the spell is wasted, but any resources used to cast it aren't expended.  
- **Soul Drain.** Creatures within 1 mile of the lair have [Disadvantage](/03_Mechanics/CLI/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on Death Saving Throws.  

If the mummy lord is destroyed or moves its lair elsewhere, these effects end immediately. The effects resume if the mummy lord gains a new body (see its Undead Restoration trait).
