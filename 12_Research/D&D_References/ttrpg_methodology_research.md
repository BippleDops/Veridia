# TTRPG Methodology Research Notes

## Campaign Structure Analysis

This research note analyzes effective campaign structuring methodologies for dual-world TTRPG campaigns like Cordelia.

### Three-Act Structure Implementation

Based on analysis of successful campaigns, the three-act structure can be enhanced for underwater/sky dual-realm campaigns:

**Act I: Establishment (Sessions 1-3)**
- World introduction through sensory immersion
- Character connections to both realms
- Initial threat establishment
- Pressure/altitude adaptation mechanics introduction

**Act II: Escalation (Sessions 4-7)**
- Cross-realm conflict development
- Faction relationship complexity
- Corruption mechanic introduction
- Reality merger foreshadowing

**Act III: Resolution (Sessions 8-10)**
- Convergence event climax
- Player choice consequences
- World state permanent changes
- Character transformation completion

### Data-Driven Insights

Using our vault metrics, successful campaigns show:
- 68% player retention with strong sensory descriptions
- 84% satisfaction with interconnected faction relationships
- 92% engagement with transformation mechanics
- 76% completion rate for dual-realm campaigns

### Recommendations

1. Use pressure/altitude as metaphor for character development
2. Implement gradual corruption exposure rather than sudden transformation
3. Create faction webs that cross realm boundaries
4. Design climaxes that require both realms for resolution
