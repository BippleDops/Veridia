# Potion of Giant Strength

## Overview

**Type**: Magic Item

**Group**: *Potions*

**Rarity**: *varies*

## Description

When you drink this potion, your [[Strength]] score changes for 1hour. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.

This potionâ€™s transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The *potion of [[Giant, Frost|frost giant]] strength* and the *potion of [[Giant, Stone|stone giant]] strength* have the same effect.
