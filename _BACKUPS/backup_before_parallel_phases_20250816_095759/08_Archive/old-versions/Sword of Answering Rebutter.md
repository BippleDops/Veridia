*Weapon ([[Longsword Xphb), major, legendary (requires attunement by a neutral good creature)* - **Damage**: - One-handed: `dice: 1d8` slashing - Two-handed: `dice: 1d10` slashing
- **Properties**: [item properties#Versatile|Versatile]]
- **Weight**: 3.0 lbs. In the world of Greyhawk, only nine of these blades are known to exist. Each is patterned after the legendary sword Fragarach, which is variously translated as "Final Word." Each of the nine swords has its own name and alignment, and each bears a different gem in its pommel. Rebutter, the Neutral Good sword, has a topaz set in its pommel. You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this sword. In addition, while you hold the sword, you can use your reaction to make one melee attack with it against any creature in your reach that deals damage to you. You have advantage on the attack roll, and any damage dealt with this special attack ignores any damage immunity or resistance the target has. *Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 206* ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Player-Facing Summary Sword of answering rebutter is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass.
