## Description

A firenewt warrior can spew fire. Many of these warriors have a close relationship with giant striders (in this book). They provide shelter, food, and breeding grounds in their lairs for giant striders, which then voluntarily serve them as mounts.

**Firenewts.** Originally from the Elemental Plane of Fire, firenewts can be found on the Material Plane near hot springs and volcanoes. These amphibians need hot water to live, becoming sluggish after spending a week away from a source of moist heat. Firenewts therefore delve for sources of heat in the earth, and a firenewt lair features a network of channels and sluices to circulate hot liquid through the area.

## Environment

desert, hill, mountain, underdark
