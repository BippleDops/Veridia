--- > [!figure] View # Nereidios - The Scholar's Grave > *"Knowledge itself became sentient and predatory. Books swim through the streets like schools of fish, and reading the wrong text can rewrite your memories."* ## 🔧 Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Overview A vast library-city where the boundary between knowledge and reality has dissolved. The continent exists as much in thought as in physical space. Buildings are constructed from crystallized ideas, streets flow like streams of consciousness, and the very air carries whispers of forbidden knowledge. ## Government: The Cognition Collective A hive mind of preserved brains in jars, connected by neural fluid flowing through the city's aqueducts. Each brain retains its personality but shares processing power with the collective. ## The Dark Secret The scholars discovered their reality is itself being written. The Infinite Archive contains books that describe everything happening in Aquabyssos in real-time, and editing these books changes reality. A secret war rages between those trying to write better endings and those trying to preserve the narrative. ## Adventure Hooks 1. **The Unwritten Book**: A blank book appears that erases anything written in it from existence

2. **Memory Plague**: Citizens losing memories that never existed
3. **The Author Search**: Faction seeking the one writing their reality
4. **Paradox Prison**: Rescue someone trapped between existing and not
5. **The Final Chapter**: Someone's trying to write "The End" for Aquabyssos ## Notable Quotes > *"In Nereidios, forgetting is a luxury we can't afford, and remembering is a curse we can't escape."* - The Mothkeeper > *"We discovered the truth: every book is true somewhere, every story is real to someone, and every ending is just another beginning we haven't read yet."* - Unknown Scholar ### Random Encounters (d6)

1. Aggressive autobiography trying to rewrite passersby
2. Swarm of punctuation marks escaped from grammar prison
3. Memory merchant offering suspicious deals
4. Thought-form of someone's nightmare
5. Paradox zone where effect precedes cause
6. Living equation seeking solution ## Player-Facing Summary Nereidios is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of Nereidios as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around Nereidios. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
