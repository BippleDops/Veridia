# Charm Monster
*4th-level, Enchantment*  


- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

One creature you can see within range makes a Wisdom saving throw. It does so with [[advantage-xphb|Advantage]] if you or your allies are fighting it. On a failed save, the target has the [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] condition until the spell ends or until you or your allies damage it. The [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] creature is [[friendly-attitude-xphb|Friendly]] to you. When the spell ends, the target knows it was [[conditions#Charmed|Charmed]] by you.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.
