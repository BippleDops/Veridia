## Description
While holding this [[Shield|shield]], you can speak its [[Command|command]] word as a [[12 - The Order of Combat|bonus action]] to cause it to animate. The shield leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a [[12 - The Order of Combat|bonus action]] to end this effect, or until you are [[Incapacitated|incapacitated]] or die, at which point the shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you have one free.
