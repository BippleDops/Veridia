# Order of the Silver Dragon +2 Shield

**Type:** Magic Item

**Group:** Wondrous Items, Armor, Shield

**Rarity:** rare

**Weight**: 6 lbs.

## Description

While holding this shield, you have a +2 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.

The shield is emblazoned with a stylized silver dragon that is the emblem of the Order of the Silver Dragon (see **Curse of Strahd**, chapter 7 The Order of the Silver Dragon). The shield whispers warnings to its bearer, granting a +2 bonus to initiative if the bearer isn't [[Incapacitated]].

A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.
