# Morale
*Source: Dungeon Master's Guide p. 273* 

Some combatants might run away when a fight turns against them. You can use this optional rule to help determine when monsters and NPCs flee.

A creature might flee under any of the following circumstances:

- The creature is [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Surprised|surprised]].  
- The creature is reduced to half its hit points or fewer for the first time in the battle.  
- The creature has no way to harm the opposing side on its turn.  

A group of creatures might flee under any of the following circumstances:

- All the creatures in the group are [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Surprised|surprised]].  
- The group's leader is reduced to 0 hit points, [[/03_Mechanics/CLI/conditions#Incapacitated|incapacitated]], taken prisoner, or removed from battle.  
- The group is reduced to half its original size with no losses on the opposing side.  

To determine whether a creature or group of creatures flees, make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw for the creature or the group's leader. If the opposition is overwhelming, the saving throw is made with disadvantage, or you can decide that the save fails automatically. If a group's leader can't make the saving throw for whatever reason, have the creature in the group with the next highest Charisma score make the saving throw instead.

On a failed save, the affected creature or group flees by the most expeditious route. If escape is impossible, the creature or group surrenders. If a creature or group that surrenders is attacked by its conquerors, the battle might resume, and it's unlikely that further attempts to flee or surrender will be made.

A failed saving throw isn't always to the adventurers' benefit. For example, an ogre that flees from combat might put the rest of the dungeon on alert or run off with treasure that the characters had hoped to plunder.

## Player-Facing Summary

Morale is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices.

## Lore Details

Legends speak of morale as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omens—shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the wind—that herald change around morale.

## Adventure Hooks

- A rumor ties morale to a missing shipment, linking factions with competing claims.
- An NPC seeks discreet help at morale to avert a public scandal.
- A map overlay reveals a hidden approach to morale active only during specific tides/storms.

## DM Notes

Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
