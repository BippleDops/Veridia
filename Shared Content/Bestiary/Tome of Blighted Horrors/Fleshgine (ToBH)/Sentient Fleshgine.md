# Sentient Fleshgine
## Description
While most [[Fleshgine|fleshgines]] are simple, mindless servitors made of flesh stitched and grown to inorganic parts and contraptions, some grow into something altogether different. Sentient [[Fleshgine|fleshgines]] take on aspects of their humanoid neighbors that seep in from their close proximity on a daily basis. These aspects include tics, habits, language, and even some of their vices. These creatures are often bloated by the desires and madness of Between and become enraptured by it, seeking new directions and becoming fixated in disturbing ways. These constructs often form complex alliances with those who dwell behind the veneer of the [[2. Mechanics Reference Almanac/Spells/PHB Spells/A-E/Blight]], particularly with the ghouls of the Fetch (who have enough inert humanity to understand and fear the construct). Some say the thoughts of the Crooked Promethean violate their dreams and awaken them; others say that it is a simple accident of nature. These sentient constructs lurk in plain sight and are driven by whatever twisted needs or goals have grown within their warped consciousness.

As more complex [[Fleshgine|fleshgines]] are grafted from darker sources of flesh and bone, so too the risk of disaster becomes greater. Philosophers within the city-state already worry what [[Fleshgine|fleshgines]] might do if they rebelled en masse. They point to the curious whale-song that occasionally haunts certain nights, and which seems to come from the [[Fleshgine|fleshgines]] calling to each other across the city. What are they saying or planning, they wonder? The golem-stitchers and homuncule wives laugh at such suggestions; their creations are simple flesh-and-blood machines after all. What maliciousness could possibly lurk within this humble framework?

All sentient [[Fleshgine|fleshgines]] that have gone berserk at least once in the past develop an urge toward murderous abduction called “take” or “taking.” Occasionally the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]]’s habits and needs drive it to seize a victim at least one size category smaller than the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]]. The [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] is always cunning in this action and manipulates its manifold parts and surroundings to camouflage its action. If the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]]’s Stealth check beats the victim’s passive Perception, the victim doesn’t see the attack coming and the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] gets to make a grappling attack with tactical advantage. If the victim notices the attack coming, then it’s just a normal attack by the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]]. While the victim is grappled by the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]], it’s also restrained, muffled (unable to cry out or speak), and suffocating. After a number of rounds equal to its Con modifier (minimum of 1), it becomes unconscious. At that point, the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] hides the victim in some convenient location around or within its body. The victim remains unconscious until it dies or it’s rescued.

Casual observers notice the hidden victim if their passive Perception exceeds (10 + the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]]’s Stealth bonus). Anyone specifically looking for a victim taken by the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] must win a contest of their Perception against the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]]’s Stealth or Deception ([[Fleshgine|fleshgine]]’s choice). A taken victim is found automatically if the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] is destroyed, but also might be injured, depending on the type of attacks used against the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] and the size difference between them; GMs can apply their own judgment in these cases.

If a victim escapes the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]]’s grapple, the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] might attack or flee, depending on the situation. A taken victim takes damage equal to any one of the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]]’s melee attacks after every 24 hours. The taken victims are used to vent the leeched needs of the [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] — whether they be simple hunger, torment, or sexual — before their dead and broken remains are cast away.

A sentient [[Fleshgine|fleshgine]] is always torn between its urges to seize a victim and the knowledge that discovery means certain punishment and death. It therefore carefully watches its chosen victim, often for weeks or months before striking.

The following entries describe three sample types of [[Fleshgine|fleshgines]]. Many more are possible.
