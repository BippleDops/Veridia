--- # Races

*Source: Adventurer's Codex (2014), p. 17* A visit to one of the great cities in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragonsâ€”Waterdeep, the [[Free City of Greyhawk, or even uncanny Sigil, the City of Doors overwhelms the senses. Voices chatter in countless different languages. The smells of cooking in dozens of different cuisines mingle with the odors of crowded streets and poor sanitation. Buildings in myriad architectural styles display the diverse origins of their inhabitants. And the people themselvesâ€”people of varying size, shape, and color, dressed in a dazzling spectrum of styles and huesâ€”represent many different races, from diminutive halflings and stout dwarves to majestically beautiful elves, mingling among a variety of human ethnicities. Scattered among the members of these more common races are the true exotics: a hulking dragonborn here, pushing his way through the crowd, and a sly tiefling there, lurking in the shadows with mischief in her eyes. A group of gnomes laughs as one of them activates a clever wooden toy that moves of its own accord. Half-elves and half-orcs live and work alongside humans, without fully belonging to the races of either of their parents. And there, well out of the sunlight, is a lone drowâ€”a fugitive from the subterranean expanse of the Underdark, trying to make his way in a world that fears his kind. [The Adventurer]]'s Codex has more information about these unusual races. ![](/03_Mechanics/CLI/books/players-handbook-2014/img/ch2.webp#center) ## ðŸ”§ [[Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### [Connection Improvements]] - Add cross-references to related notes ### [[Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## [Uncommon Races]] The dragonborn and the rest of the races in this list are uncommon. They don't exist in every world of D&D, and even where they are found, they are less widespread than dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans. In the cosmopolitan cities of the D&D multiverse, most people hardly look twice at members of even the most exotic races. But the small towns and villages that dot the countryside are different. The common folk aren't accustomed to seeing members of these races, and they react accordingly. ### [[Dragonborn It's easy to assume that a dragonborn is a monster, especially if his or her scales betray a chromatic heritage. Unless the dragonborn starts breathing fire and causing destruction, though, people are likely to respond with caution rather than outright fear. ### [Gnome Gnomes]] don't look like a threat and can quickly disarm suspicion with good humor. The common folk are often curious about gnomes, likely never having seen one before, but they are rarely hostile or fearful. ### Half-[[Elf Although many people have never seen a half-elf, virtually everyone knows they exist. A half-elf stranger's arrival is followed by gossip behind the half-elf's back and stolen glances across the common room, rather than any confrontation or open curiosity. ### Half-[Orc It]]'s usually safe to assume that a half-orc is belligerent and quick to anger, so people watch themselves around an unfamiliar half-orc. Shopkeepers might surreptitiously hide valuable or fragile goods when a half-orc comes in, and people slowly clear out of a tavern, assuming a fight will break out soon. ### [[Tiefling Half-orcs are greeted with a practical caution, but tieflings are the subject of supernatural fear. The evil of their heritage is plainly visible in their features, and as far as most people are concerned, a tiefling could very well be a devil straight from the [Nine Hells]]. People might make warding signs as a tiefling approaches, cross the street to avoid passing near, or bar shop doors before a tiefling can enter. ## Choosing a [[Race Humans are the most common people in the worlds of D&D, but they live and work alongside dwarves, elves, halflings, and countless other fantastic species. Your character belongs to one of these peoples. Not every intelligent race of the multiverse is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. Dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans are the most common races to produce the sort of adventurers who make up typical parties. Other races and subraces are less common as adventurers. Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character's adventuring career. When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play. For example, a halfling could be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes a tough warrior, and an elf can be a master of arcane magic. Your character race not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for building your character's story. Each race's description in this chapter includes information to help you roleplay a character of that race, including personality, physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies. These details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can deviate widely from the norm for their race. It's worthwhile to consider why your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character's background and personality. ### [Racial Traits]] The description of each race includes racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries appear among the traits of most races. #### [[Ability Score [Increase Every]] race increases one or more of a character's ability scores. #### [[Age The age entry notes the age when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race's expected lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom. #### [Size Characters]] of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in chapter 5. #### [[Speed Your speed determines how far you can move when traveling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter 9). #### [Languages By]] virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages. Chapter 4 lists the most common languages of the D&D multiverse. #### [[Subraces Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race to race and world to world. In the Dragonlance campaign setting, for example, mountain dwarves and hill dwarves live together as different clans of the same people, but in the [Forgotten Realms]], they live far apart in separate kingdoms and call themselves shield dwarves and gold dwarves, respectively. - [[dragonborn-xphb (races) - [[[Dwarf Xphb]]]] - [[elf-xphb (races) - [gnome-xphb (races)]] - [[[Half Elf]] - [[[Half Orc]] - [[[Halfling Xphb]] - [[[Human Xphb]] - [[[[List Spells [Races Tiefling]] Xphb]] ## Player-[[Facing Summary 03 races is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## [Lore Details]] Legends speak of 03 races as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around 03 races. ## DM [[Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use. ## Related *Links to related content will be added here.* ## 12_Research [Specific Content]] Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research [[Specific Content Contextual improvement based on 12_Research ## 12_Research [Specific Content]] Contextual improvement based on 12_Research
