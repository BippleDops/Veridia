**Blends Into Darkness:** A grue has tactical disadvantage on Stealth checks when not in darkness or dim light.

**Extinguish Light:** As a bonus action, a grue can extinguish one normal (nonmagical) light within 100 feet.

**Swallow:** A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained. It takes 5 (`dice: 1d8+1`) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (`dice: 1d8`) acid damage automatically at the start of each of the grue's turns. Up to two Medium creatures or four Small creatures can be inside the grue at one time. A swallowed creature is unaffected by anything happening outside the grue or by attacks from outside it. A swallowed creature can get out of the grue by using 5 feet of movement, but only after the grue is dead.

## Description
A type 1 grue is a nasty, large thing with dark gray or green skin, rather like a half-filled water balloon ten feet long, with a huge mouth filled with needlelike teeth. Inside its leathery skin, the grue is mostly gelatinous goo surrounding an enormous stomach. Its rubbery hide is deceptively thick and tough. [[Grue (Type 2)|Grues]] can’t coexist with light; if they are exposed to a light source, they instantly retreat into the darkness. In the dark, however, they are dangerous.

Once a grue swallows a victim, it is satisfied. It will leave with a full stomach if it is permitted to do so. They are unintelligent, despite their evil appearance, and they eat people for nourishment, not out of malice. Although they don’t accumulate treasure, valuable items can sometimes be found in their guts, depending on how recently they’ve eaten a wellsupplied adventurer.
