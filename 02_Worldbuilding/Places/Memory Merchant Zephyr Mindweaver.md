## Description

Zephyr Mindweaver appears as an ethereally beautiful sea elf with silver-blue skin that shimmers like moonlight on water. Her long, flowing hair seems to move as if underwater even in open air, and her eyes are pools of swirling mist that occasionally flash with fragments of memories - not her own, but those she has collected. Intricate tattoos of runic patterns cover her arms, each one a mnemonic device for organizing her vast collection of memories.

She dresses in robes woven from [[Abyssal Kelp]], adorned with crystalline memory orbs that hang like jewelry around her neck and wrists. These orbs glow softly with different colors, each hue representing different types of memories - golden for joy, blue for sorrow, silver for knowledge, and crimson for passion.

## Personality

Zephyr is intensely curious about the experiences of others, viewing each person as a library of unique memories waiting to be catalogued. She speaks in a melodious voice that carries hints of distant echoes, as if her words are filtered through countless other voices. Despite dealing in memories, she is surprisingly empathetic, understanding the weight and value of each experience she handles.

She has a peculiar habit of pausing mid-conversation to "taste" a memory, her eyes briefly clouding over as she examines some fragment of experience. Zephyr is fair in her dealings but shrewd, knowing that memories are the most precious currency in the deep places of the world.

## Backstory

Once a court wizard in the [[Sunken Kingdom of Nereon]], Zephyr discovered her unique gift for memory manipulation during a catastrophic magical accident that claimed the lives of her research partner and closest friend. In her grief, she attempted to preserve their memories, accidentally absorbing not just their final moments but their entire life experiences.

This traumatic event awakened her to the fragile nature of memory and experience. She left the court to become a wandering collector, believing that by preserving memories, she could prevent the true death that comes when one is forgotten entirely. Over centuries, she has built the largest collection of memories in the [[Abyssal Depths]], ranging from the mundane daily experiences of common folk to the profound revelations of ancient [[Depth Seekers]].

## Current Motivations

- **Preserve Lost Histories:** Collecting memories of extinct civilizations and vanished cultures
- **Understand the Memory Plague:** Investigating reports of a strange affliction causing mass amnesia in the [[Coral Gardens]]
- **Find Her Friend's Soul:** Seeking a way to restore her lost research partner using their preserved memories
- **Protect Memory Sanctity:** Opposing those who would use memory magic for evil purposes

## Services & Interactions

### Memory Services
- **Memory Extraction:** Remove traumatic or unwanted memories (500-2,000 gp)
- **Memory Implantation:** Grant skills, languages, or experiences from her collection (1,000-5,000 gp)
- **Memory Recovery:** Restore lost or suppressed memories (750-3,000 gp)
- **Information Brokering:** Sell specific knowledge or experiences (100-10,000 gp depending on rarity)

### Special Offerings
- **Past Life Consultation:** Using ancient memories to provide insight into reincarnation mysteries
- **Skill Downloads:** Temporarily grant proficiencies or abilities through memory implantation
- **Emotional Healing:** Help process trauma by experiencing similar memories of others who overcame adversity
- **Historical Research:** Access to memories spanning thousands of years

## Relationships

**[[Sage Pelagic]]** - Intellectual rival and occasional research partner. They compete to collect the rarest historical memories but respect each other's expertise.

**[[Doctor Coral Shapeshift]]** - Professional relationship. Zephyr provides memory-based trauma treatment for Coral's patients, while Coral helps Zephyr understand the medical aspects of memory disorders.

**[[The Forgotten Court]]** - Maintains careful neutrality with this faction of exiled nobles, though she possesses memories that could restore or damn many of them.

**[[Captain Hadal Drake]]** - Trades information with this deep-sea explorer, exchanging navigation memories for funding and protection during her travels.

**[[The Memory Thieves Guild]]** - Actively opposes this criminal organization that steals and sells memories without consent.

**[[Temple Guardian Marcus the Drowned]]** - Complicated relationship. Marcus seeks to retrieve memories stolen from his temple, while Zephyr claims they came to her legitimately.

**[[Spymaster Crow]]** - Mutually beneficial arrangement where they trade information, though neither fully trusts the other.

## Current Location & Activities

Zephyr operates from the **[[Memory Bazaar]]**, a pocket dimension accessible through mirrors in the [[Abyssal Depths]]. Her shop, "Mindful Acquisitions," is a crystalline cave filled with thousands of memory orbs organized by type, age, and emotional resonance.

Currently, she is investigating strange reports of memories being "eaten" by something in the deep trenches. Several of her regular clients have come to her with gaps in their recollections that even her magic cannot restore. She suspects this is connected to an ancient entity stirring in the [[Hadal Zone]].

### Daily Activities
- **Dawn:** Meditation and memory organization
- **Morning:** Client consultations and memory extraction/implantation
- **Afternoon:** Research and cataloguing new acquisitions
- **Evening:** Networking with other information brokers
- **Night:** Exploring the deepest memories in her collection for hidden patterns

## Campaign Hooks

1. **The Lost Memory:** A powerful noble's memories of a hidden treasure vault have been stolen, and they hire the party to retrieve them from Zephyr's collection.

2. **Memory Plague Investigation:** Strange amnesia is spreading through the [[Coral Gardens]]. Zephyr needs the party's help to investigate its source in dangerous deep-sea locations.

3. **The Perfect Crime:** Someone is using stolen memories to frame innocents for crimes they never committed. The party must help Zephyr track down the memory thief.

4. **Ancient Warnings:** Zephyr discovers memories from a lost civilization warning of an approaching catastrophe. She needs the party to verify the threat and possibly prevent it.

5. **Memory Merchant's Dilemma:** Zephyr has been offered an incredibly valuable memory that would complete her research, but acquiring it would require betraying a trusted ally.

## Treasure

Zephyr's shop contains:
- **Memory Orbs** (varies): Crystalline spheres containing specific memories or skills
- **Circlet of Mental Protection** (very rare): Advantage on saves against mind-affecting magic
- **Robes of the Memory Keeper** (rare): +2 AS, advantage on Intelligence (History) checks
- **Pearl of Remembrance** (uncommon): Once per day, perfectly recall any memory from the last month
- Ancient spell scrolls of rare enchantment spells
- Platinum and pearl currency worth approximately 50,000 gp

## Notes

Zephyr represents the ethical complexities of memory magic - she genuinely seeks to preserve and protect experiences, but her methods raise questions about the ownership of one's own thoughts and memories. She serves as both a valuable ally and potential moral dilemma for player characters seeking her services.

Her vast collection makes her one of the most knowledgeable NPCs in the campaign, capable of providing information about nearly any historical event or lost secret, but always at a price.
