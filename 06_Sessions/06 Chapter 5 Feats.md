--- # Chapter 5: Feats

*Source: Player's Handbook (2024), p. 199* !] This chapter offers a collection of feats, which are special features not tied to a character class. A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond what a class provides. The sections below explain the parts of a feat and list a variety of feat options separated into categories. Your background gives you a feat, and at certain levels, your class gives you the "Ability Score Improvement" feat or the choice of another feat for which you qualify. By whatever means you acquire a feat, you can take it only once unless its description says otherwise. ## ðŸ”§ Deep Evaluation Improvements *20 targeted improvements identified* ### Connection Improvements - Add cross-references to related notes ### Enhancement Improvements - Add 12_Research-specific enhancement ## Feat Descriptions This chapter's feats are organized by categoryâ€”"Origin", "General", "Fighting Style", or "Epic Boon"â€”and alphabetized in each category. All the feats are listed alphabetically in the "Feat List table". If a feat can be taken more than once, an asterisk appears after its name in that table. ### Parts of a Feat The description of a feat contains the following parts, which are presented after the feat's name. #### Category A feat is a member of a category, which is noted in the feat. If you're instructed to choose a feat from a specific category, such as the Origin category, that category must appear under the feat's name. If you're instructed to choose a feat and no category is specified, you can choose from any category. #### Prerequisite To take a feat, you must meet any prerequisite in its description unless a feature allows you to take the feat without the prerequisite. If a prerequisite includes a class, you must have at least 1 level in that class to take the feat. #### Benefit The benefits of a feat are detailed after any prerequisites are listed. If you have a feat, you gain its benefits. #### Repeatable A feat can be taken only once unless its description states otherwise in a "Repeatable" subsection. ## Origin Feats These feats are in the Origin category. - [[alert-xphb (feats)]] - [[Crafter Xphb]] - [[Healer Xphb]] - [[Lucky Xphb]] - [[List Spells Feats Magic Initiate Xphb]] - [[musician-xphb (feats)]] - [[savage-attacker-xphb (feats)]] - [[skilled-xphb (feats)]] - [[tavern-brawler-xphb (feats)]] - [[Tough Xphb]] ## General Feats These feats are in the General category. - [[Ability Score Improvement Xphb]] - [[Actor Xphb]] - [[athlete-xphb (feats)]] - [[charger-xphb (feats)]] - [[Chef Xphb]] - [[crossbow-expert-xphb (feats)]] - [[Crusher Xphb]] - [[defensive-duelist-xphb (feats)]] - [[dual-wielder-xphb (feats)]] - [[Durable Xphb]] - [[Elemental Adept Xphb]] - [[fey]] - [[Grappler Xphb]] - [[great-weapon-master-xphb (feats)]] - [[heavily-armored-xphb (feats)]] - [[heavy-armor-master-xphb (feats)]] - [[inspiring-leader-xphb (feats)]] - [[keen-mind-xphb (feats)]] - [[lightly-armored-xphb (feats)]] - [[mage-slayer-xphb (feats)]] - [[Martial Weapon Training Xphb]] - [[Medium Armor Master Xphb]] - [[moderately-armored-xphb (feats)]] - [[mounted-combatant-xphb (feats)]] - [[observant-xphb (feats)]] - [[Piercer Xphb]] - [[Poisoner Xphb]] - [[Polearm Master Xphb]] - [[resilient-xphb (feats)]] - [[ritual-caster-xphb (feats)]] - [[Sentinel Xphb]] - [[list-spells-feats-shadow-touched-xphb (lists)]] - [[sharpshooter-xphb (feats)]] - [[Shield]] - [[skill-expert-xphb (feats)]] - [[Skulker Xphb]] - [[slasher-xphb (feats)]] - [[Speedy Xphb]] - [[Spell Sniper Xphb]] - [[List Spells Feats Telekinetic Xphb]] - [[List Spells Feats Telepathic Xphb]] - [[War Caster Xphb]] - [[great-weapon-master-xphb (feats)]] ## Fighting Style Feats These feats are in the Fighting Style category. - [[Archery Xphb]] - [[Blind Fighting Xphb]] - [[Defense Xphb]] - [[dueling-xphb (feats)]] - [[Great Weapon Fighting Xphb]] - [[interception-xphb (feats)]] - [[Protection Xphb]] - [[thrown-weapon-fighting-xphb (feats)]] - [[two-weapon-fighting-xphb (feats)]] - [[unarmed-fighting-xphb (feats)]] ## Epic Boon Feats These feats are in the Epic Boon category. - [[boon-of-combat-prowess-xphb (feats)]] - [[boon-of-dimensional-travel-xphb (feats)]] - [[boon-of-energy-resistance-xphb (feats)]] - [[boon-of-fate-xphb (feats)]] - [[Boon of Fortitude Xphb]] - [[boon-of-irresistible-offense-xphb (feats)]] - [[Boon of Recovery Xphb]] - [[boon-of-skill-xphb (feats)]] - [[Boon of Speed Xphb]] - [[boon-of-spell-recall-xphb (feats)]] - [[boon-of-the-night-spirit-xphb (feats)]] - [[boon-of-truesight-xphb (feats)]] ## Player-Facing Summary 06 chapter 5 feats is a undersea element of the setting, known for bioluminescent glow and pressure-glass. Its presence anchors ongoing storylines and offers clear player choices. ## Lore Details Legends speak of 06 chapter 5 feats as a nexus where past and present converge. Locals describe subtle omensâ€”shifts in currents, a dimming of lanternfish, or whispers on the windâ€”that herald change around 06 chapter 5 feats. ## DM Notes Play up tactile detail: sounds, pressure/wind changes, and meaningful symbology. Offer two clear approaches (stealth vs. Parley) and one wildcard complication tied to a faction clock. Reward scouting and map use.
