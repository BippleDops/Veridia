# Echoes (TnrCTOS)

## Overview
**Level**: *2nd-level*

**School**: *illusion*

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 100 feet

**Components**: V, S, M (a tiny tin gong or cymbal)

**Duration**: 1 minute


## Effects
You pick one creature you can see within range. For that creature, every sound is am-plified and reverberates with distressing loudness. While this spell is in effect, the creature cannot use the Perception skill to hear noises, has disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks, and the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. The creature takes 2d6 thunder damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.
